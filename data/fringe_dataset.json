Befestigen sie bitte ihre Sicherheitsg\u00fcrtel.\nANNOUNCEMENT: The Captain has turned on the fasten seat-belts sign. Please make sure your seatbelts are securely fastened.\nGERMAN WOMAN: Ich m\u00f6chte sehen wie der Film weitergeht. (I would like to see the film continue)\nMAN FROM DENVER: I don't speak German. I'm from Denver.\nGERMAN WOMAN: Dies ist mein erster Flug. (this is my first flight)\nMAN FROM DENVER: I'm from Denver.\nANNOUNCEMENT: Wir durchfliegen jetzt starke Turbulenzen. Nehmen sie bitte ihre Pl\u00e4tze ein. (we are flying through strong turbulence. please return to your seats)\nINDIAN MAN: Hey, friend. It's just an electrical storm.\nMORGAN STEIG: I understand.\nINDIAN MAN: Here. Gum?\nMORGAN STEIG: No, thank you.\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT: Mein Herr, sie m\u00fcssen sich hinsetzen! (sir, you must sit down) Beruhigen sie sich! (calm down!) Beruhigen sie sich! (calm down!) Entschuldigen sie bitte! Gehen sie zu ihrem Sitz zur\u00fcck! [please, go back to your seat!]\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT: (on phone) Kapit\u00e4n! Wir haben eine Notsituation! (Captain, we have a difficult situation!)\nPILOT: ... gibt eine Not-... (... if necessary...) Sprechen sie mit mir! (talk to me) Was zum Teufel passiert! (what the hell is going on?) Beruhigen ... (...calm down...) Warum antworten sie mir nicht! (why don't you answer me?) Reden sie mit mir! (talk to me)\nOLIVIA: Oh my god!\nJOHN SCOTT: What?\nOLIVIA: This bed is loud.\nJOHN SCOTT: You think?\nOLIVIA: We can't keep doing this. Sneaking around.\nJOHN SCOTT: Department is not a massive fan of office romance. The policy seminar was endless, wasn't it? Kept finding myself staring at you, I decided to move my chair to stop.\nOLIVIA: Well, I think Charlie knows.\nJOHN SCOTT: No, he doesn't know.\nOLIVIA: Well, I think he does.\nJOHN SCOTT: If he knew, we would be transferred. The idea somebody making a call whether not you and I get to live in the same city is unacceptable to me. Anyway that's just a preamble to a kicker, which is that - I love you.\nOLIVIA: (answers her cell phone) Olivia Dunham. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Yes, sir. I-I... I'm on my way. (to John): Incident at Logan. International flight. Charlie is on his way.\nJOHN SCOTT: (answers his cell phone) Agent Scott.\nOLIVIA: Olivia Dunham, FBI.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: We've got a flight out of Hamburg, 147 passengers. Tower has lost contact three hours in. They thought it might have been electrical interference. They enter in our airspace radio silent. Navy then scrambles two F-18 for escort. They reported stains on the windows, no signs of life aboard the jet. White House approved the CDC's request for the jet not to be opened until they arrive.\nOLIVIA: No signs of life? Who was flying the plane?\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Logan is one of the first airports with the PEARL autopilot system. Plane landed itself right on time, unlike every flight I've ever taken.\nJOHN (on phone): ... well, let me assure you, we'd be happy to treat you as family too. (to all) Good old NTSB, they all like to think they're cops.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Agent Scott.\nJOHN SCOTT: Agent Francis. Agent Dunham.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Whatever the hell McNeary shot through that window, it made him throw up in front of his whole unit.\n(security checkpoint to the tarmac)\nMAN IN CAR: Excuse me. So what's going on here? Some sort of an accident?\nGUARD: The tarmac is closed. Nothing you need to worry about, sir.\nMAN IN CAR: Alright.\nGUARD: Move on.\nMAN IN CAR: I'll do that. Thank you.\n(standing next to Flight 627)\nBROYLES: Although this is a joint task force, you are all reporting to the Department of Homeland Security. I'm Special-Agent-in-Charge Broyles. DC has sent me here to make sure we get results. Standard Level 4 HAZMAT suits are required to go in. Members from each agency of the starting line as follows: CIA, Faranough. FBI, Charlie Francis and John Scott. Everyone else stand by. OK people, let's move.\nOLIVIA: Sir. Olivia Dunham. FBI's interagency liaison.\nBROYLES: Liaison on an interagency task force, got to love that. Kinda like powdered sugar on a glazed doughnut.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me, if I'm gonna do my job effectively, I'd like my information first hand, that's not redundancy, that's accountability.\nBROYLES: I know exactly who you are. You want in, Liaison? Suit-up.\nAGENT: What kind of terrorism is this?\nOLIVIA: Who says it's terrorism?\nNEWS ANCHOR: (voiceover from broadcast)... sources tell us, that the plane was deliberately set ablaze by the CDC.\nAGENT #1: I've got 15E. Seat 41A. John Rosenblum, Honolulu Hawaii. Car salesman... criminal history checks negative.\nAGENT #2: ...intelligence check's negative.\nOLIVIA: Have we reviewed video from Hamburg Airport? We need to see if any passengers were showing signs of illness.\nAGENT DAWSON: ...ground crew who fueled the airplane. We need names.\nBROYLES: On it's way Agent Dawson. And what the hell is taking so long with that black box?\nAGENT #4: Report says maintenance replaced oxygen tank an hour before take-off.\nOLIVIA: Please tell me that terminal's shut down.\nBROYLES: It's been down since 4:00 local time. You got any more questions?\nOLIVIA: Who's point from CDC on the bone tissue and air sample?\nBROYLES: Agent Paley. You want his home number?\nOLIVIA: No, but I'd like the whole report, and not just this fax, claiming that there's no matches...\nBACKGROUND: ...to any known pathogens or airborne viruses.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) We're on that too, Liaison. We don't think what happened on that plane was a result of the in-flight movie.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: (to all) Back Bay PD got a call at 3:00, from a guard on duty from a storage facility. He saw two, and I quote, 'suspicious middle-eastern men' handing a white guy a briefcase.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) Liaison, take it. Go find out.\nOLIVIA: Take what? That? You're telling me that's my assignment?\nBROYLES: Yeah, Honey, would you mind?\nNEWS ANCHOR: (voiceover from broadcast) \"... CDC's control. The decision was made to burn the plane only after ...\"\n(Olivia and John walking along a snow-covered storage facility)\nOLIVIA: Petty bastard. He's pissed because his best friend sexually assaulted three marine privates. And I'm the bad guy, cause I put him away.\nJOHN SCOTT: Broyles is an idiot. You're smarter, you're stronger, you're much better looking. He's jealous.\n(Olivia stops walking)\nJOHN SCOTT: What?\nOLIVIA: You said you loved me. In the motel.\nJOHN SCOTT: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: That was a big deal.\nJOHN SCOTT: Yeah, well you didn't say anything back, so I just let it go.\nOLIVIA: I've been sorta bad at this, for a long time. Until you. I wanted to say, I love you too.\n(Staring and smiling at each other, John kisses Olivia)\nJOHN SCOTT: Let's go check the trash together.\n(they open up and rummage through a dumpster, picking up a pair of canisters)\nOLIVIA: Empty.\nJOHN SCOTT: Acetylene, propane?\nOLIVIA: (she smells the canister) No, ammonia.\n(suddenly, John goes to pick a lock on one of the storage units)\nOLIVIA: What are you doing?\nJOHN SCOTT: What are you doing? I'm a federal agent.\n(they start opening more of the storage units...stepping into one with animals in cages and computer equipment)\nJOHN SCOTT: We need to get a chem-transport team out here now.\nOLIVIA: I'm on it. (trying her cell phone) No signal. (she goes outside to get a signal)\n(while John searches other storage units, a door from another storage unit opposite him is opened from the inside and out steps the MAN IN CAR from Logan Airport)\nJOHN SCOTT: Freeze FBI! I have a gun! I will shoot!\n(the man starts to run and John chases him while calling Olivia on his cell)\nOLIVIA: (picks up her cell phone) John?\nJOHN SCOTT: We have a runner in the back. We need him alive.\nOLIVIA: I'm on my way.\n(Olivia catches up to them. The man stops and triggers a speed-dial on his cell phone)\nJOHN SCOTT: Hands in the air!\nOLIVIA: John!\n(A storage units explode. John is engulfed in flames. Olivia is thrown against a wall and passes out)\n(Olivia in a dreamy state. Dr. Reyes voiceovers much of her recovery sequences and her initial visit to see John)\nDR. REYES: You were very lucky today, Agent Dunham. Your wounds could have easily been much more severe. Agent Scott wasn't as fortunate. While he survived the initial blast, Agent Scott was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds. Work that was done in the labs you found. He's not contagious, but until we understand more it's better not to introduce any additional contaminates. We haven't been able to identify the substance that is affecting him. The CDC has sent in specialists, but they've never seen anything like what's happening here. We've put Agent Scott in a drug induced coma. His body temperature has been lowered significantly to try and slow the progress. I'm sorry Agent Dunham.\n(Olivia is performing searches on a computer database. Her search brings up an article by a Dr. Walter Bishop entitled: \"Report on Dissolved Flesh\", from the Medical Journal Archive. She runs to Broyles)\nOLIVIA: (comes up behind Broyles) It's me. Liaison. (Broyles does not turn around) I found a connection between the Hamburg flight and what's happened to Agent Scott. (Broyles turns around) His name is Walter Bishop. He's a scientific researcher from Cambridge, born in '46. Harvard educated post-grad at Oxford and MIT. Look at the experiments he was doing in the seventies. I believe Dr. Bishop might have information that might tell us what happened aboard that plane and save Agent Scott's life.\nBROYLES: It says the guy has been at St. Claire's for 17 Years.\nOLIVIA: I saw that. An assistant was killed in his lab. Rumors about Dr. Bishop using humans as guinea pigs. He was charged with manslaughter, but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.\nBROYLES: Why are you so sure Bishop's worth our time?\nOLIVIA: Why are you so sure he's not?\nBROYLES: Listen, Dunham. You and I got off on a wrong foot.\nOLIVIA: If my past job performance as US Marine Special Investigator offends you...\nBROYLES: Well, Yeah. It does. A man who serves his country for 30 Years has a few drinks and small lapse of judgment does not deserve five years...\nOLIVIA: A small lapse in judgment that will haunt three young women for the rest of their lives.\nBROYLES: But that's not tonight's business, is it? Look, DC has tasked me to make sure that our reaction to Flight 627 is beyond reproach. Now, it says here, in 1991, the glorious State of Massachusetts forbade Dr. Bishop from having any visitors, with the exception of immediate family. So, from where I sit, barging into a mental institution, waving the Patriot Act, which is what you need, and demanding face-time with some old lab rat, who you think might be behind some of the most terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine ...\nOLIVIA: I'm coming to you with a solid lead and your personal resentment is preventing you...\nBROYLES: And you're wasting your breath and my time. Do you understand \"immediate family?\" You want to question Dr. Bishop, you go find his next of kin and have him escort you in. Talk to Bishop, uncover something substantial and I will have your back. Until then, I am not so convinced. Now, can you handle that?\nOLIVIA: He does have a son.\nBROYLES: Is his son a local too?\nOLIVIA: Not exactly.\n(helicopter flyover of the city while voiceover from the Federal Building continues)\nBROYLES: (in voiceover) So this guy's Walter Bishop's son?\nOLIVIA: (in voiceover) His name is Peter Bishop. He's a high-school drop-out, IQ at 190, just 50 points north of genius. Misfit, nomad. Hasn't kept a job longer than two months. He's been a wild land fireman, cargo pilot and briefly a college chemistry professor. He falsified a degree from MIT. He even managed to get a few papers published before he was found out. Sounds like a massive pain in the ass.\n(taxicab ride to a well-appointed hotel. meeting with two local businessmen in a private room)\nPETER: My resume is hardly traditional, but around these parts traditional increasingly means irrelevant. Hundred billion dollar sunk in infrastructure and you can barely keep the lights on. You need someone to oversee construction on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude between your fields in Kirkuk and the port of Ceyhan. A job well out of the 'Green Zone', I might add. Well, I'm still alive to do so. You need someone who has a handle on the laws of hydro-dynamic resistance, the heat exchange and oil mixture flows. You'll also need someone who can work with mixed integer programs cause you're gonna have to resize the pipes as you start working across uneven terrain. That is, if you want to keep down the construction costs. (Peter pauses when the two men begin to converse separately in their native language) Truth is, I need this job as much as you need me to do it. (when the businessmen continue their separate chat) ...I also speak Farsi. And 600,000 all-in... sounds fair.\n(in the lobby of the hotel)\nOLIVIA: Peter Bishop? Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI.\nPETER: OK.\nOLIVIA: You've heard of flight 627?\nPETER: The Hamburg flight, of course.\nOLIVIA: You may be able to help us with that.\nPETER: No, I think you've got the wrong guy.\nOLIVIA: Your father is Walter Bishop.\nPETER: The last time somebody asked me that it was an accusation.\nOLIVIA: Well, he's the man we're looking to speak with, but due to his current status, you're the only one who can provide us access.\nPETER: And what possible help could that man be to you? And what is it exactly that you're expecting me to do? Hop on a plane with you back to Massachusetts? I just got here Honey.\nOLIVIA: I can have you on a return flight here in four days, but first...\nPETER: Let me save you the time. I'd rather stay here in Iraq. That's how much I want to see my father.\nOLIVIA: I'm going to beg you as one human being to another. Your father may be able to save someone who is dying. Someone I care about very much.\nPETER: Sweetheart, we all care about someone who is dying. I can't help you, I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: I know why you're here. I have your file.\nPETER: What file?\nOLIVIA: The one the FBI would say doesn't exist. And it has everything. Where you've been, what you're running from. And what you need while you're here. So, either you come with me, or I let certain people know your whereabouts.\nPETER: When do we leave?\n(together alone in the cabin of a small jet)\nOLIVIA (on cell phone): Did the doctor say anything else? Yeah. Thanks, Charlie.\nPETER: Let me ask you something. My father, not my favorite. He is without a doubt the most self-absorbed, twisted, abusive, brilliant, myopic son-of-a-bitch on the planet. So he was a chemist. That much I already know. He worked out of a basement lab in Harvard, doing research for a toothpaste company. I also know that there was an accident at the lab one night, when my father was arrested. Beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home, but here is the thing Olivia, my gut tells me, that your friend's life, the one hanging in the balance, is not going to be saved by a tube of toothpaste.\nOLIVIA: He worked out of Harvard, but not on toothpaste. He was a part of a classified US Army experimental program called Kelvin Genetics. They gave him the resources to do whatever work he wanted. Which was primarily in an area called \"fringe science.\"\nPETER: When you say \"fringe science,\" you mean pseudo-science.\nOLIVIA: I suppose. Things like mind control, teleportation, astral projection. Invisibility, genetic mutation, re-animation, fertility...\nPETER: Whoa, excuse me for a second. Re-animation, really? So you're telling me... what? My father was Dr. Frankenstein?\n(Peter and Olivia arrive at St. Claire's, walk through security doors and past holding cells)\nPETER: You know what? Why don't you go on ahead? (turns back while she proceeds with her escort)\n(Walter sits facing a wall in a large cell)\nGUARD: Dr. Bishop, special day. You have a visitor.\nOLIVIA: Hello.\nWALTER: I knew someone would have come. Eventually.\n(Walter and Olivia sit in a large dining hall. two escorts lingering nearby)\nOLIVIA: Dr. Bishop? Dr. Bishop?\nWALTER: This was ... when did this happen?\nOLIVIA: The incident on the plane happened four days ago. Agent Scott was injured the next day.\nWALTER: Aderm already indurated. Translucent. Muscular tissue.\nOLIVIA: On Scott? You mean can you see through his skin? Yes.\nWALTER: Oh, that's not good. To see through the skin. It's tricky, it's advanced.... like that.\nOLIVIA: What's happening to him? Can it be reversed? What is it?\nWALTER: They have this horrible pudding here. Butterscotch pudding on Mondays. It's dreadful.\nOLIVIA: It's Thursday.\nWALTER: Oh. That's fantastic news! It can be reversed. What happened to your colleague. Years ago I worked with lab animals and... some of them were afflicted, but were saved.\nOLIVIA: So, do you remember what to do?\nWALTER: This place, their choice of therapies has ...\nOLIVIA: Dr. Bishop?\nWALTER: You came here today with my son. I'm not allowed visitors you see, except immediate family. Unless the order has been lifted. And it's a simple 'if-then' formula. If you are here, then so is he. I would so much, so very much like to see him. So much.\n(Olivia finds Peter waiting down the hallway)\nOLIVIA: He asked for you.\nPETER: Thanks, sweetheart. I really appreciate that.\nOLIVIA: Hey, I didn't tell him you were here. Call me sweetheart one more time, I'd really like that.\n(Peter gains his resolve and joins Walter in the dining hall)\nPETER: Hello, Walter.\nWALTER: I thought you'd be fatter.\nPETER: You thought I'd be fatter? Excellent, first words. Perfect.\nWALTER: No, as a boy. You were round.\nPETER: Yes, I was. Until the summer before high-school, not that I'd expect you to remember that.\nWALTER: May I see something?\nPETER: What are you doing? Take your hands off of me!\nWALTER: Pupils are good. They're good.\nWALTER (to Olivia): How advanced is your colleague's condition? Would you... something... I'm unable to deduce without a first-hand examination. I must see Mr. Scott myself, which I am unable to do. Under the present law. Unless, signed out by a legal guardian, who must be once again a relative.\nPETER: What are you asking me to...? No! Guardian? No. Forget it.\nOLIVIA: He'll do it.\nPETER: No, I will not.\nOLIVIA: One phone call. That's all it takes. You want me to make it? Cause I've got my phone in my pocket. Now it's out of my pocket.\nPETER: You wanted my father. Now you've got my father. Which falls into the category, be careful what you wish for, Sweetheart.\n(Peter signs out Walter and waits quietly with Olivia while Walter shaves and changes into street clothes.)\n(driving away from the asylum)\nRADIO REPORTER: (voiceover) Every effort is being made to understand what happened on Flight 627.\nOLIVIA: Dr. Bishop, I was curious. Did anyone else ever have access to your work?\nWALTER: Well, the assistants have bits and pieces... God, I suppose. I suppose the only one who really knew what I was doing was Belly.\nOLIVIA: Who?\nWALTER: Belly. William Bell, he and I shared a lab.\nOLIVIA: William Bell?\nPETER: You shared a lab with the founder of Massive Dynamics?\nWALTER: I'm sorry. I don't know what that is. Massive Dynamics.\n(to Walter) Ah, nothing really. Just a tiny little company.\nPETER: (to both) That's perfect. One guy becomes one of the wealthiest man on planet, the other guy becomes an institutionalized psychopath.\nWALTER: Oh!\nOLIVIA: What? What happened?\nWALTER: I just pissed myself.\nPETER: Excellent.\nWALTER: Just a squirt.\n(Olivia drives past a billboard advertising Massive Dynamic.)\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Just got the message, how's John?\nOLIVIA: Worse. CDC says that Hamburg flight was caused by synthetic compounds, which is like saying rain is caused by wet compounds. They've run some tests on John, but haven't come back with anything.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: What about Bishop?\nOLIVIA: Left or right? Insane, and irritating. And also my only hope. Listen. I need to question William Bell. Could you set that up for me?\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: William Bell? Massive Dynamic's William Bell?\nOLIVIA: He and Bishop used to shared a lab.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: You kidding?\n(Astrid, Olivia, Peter and Walter enter sterilized area. John is lying on an examining table. Walter stares at a skylight.)\nOLIVIA: Dr. Bishop?\nWALTER: Send Ginger ale. I need Ginger ale. Haven't had some long time. I miss it.\nOLIVIA: Can you please get some Ginger ale for the doctor, Agent Farnsworth?\n(Walter picks up scalpels and approaches John's body.)\nPETER: (to Walter) Whoa! Stop right now! Stop!\nPETER: (to Olivia) Does this not concern you?\nOLIVIA: Let him go.\nWALTER: Petri dish. Quick, please. But, I need to take this to my lab right away.\nOLIVIA: Your what?\nWALTER: Kresge Building basement, Harvard. We should leave, I have my sample.\nOLIVIA: Your lab was shut down after you left.\nWALTER: I'm sorry?\nPETER: Wake up. It's gone.\nWALTER: No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.\nPETER: Walter, there is no lab.\nWALTER: It's a perfect working... Damn you!\n(Walter smashes equipment.)\nPETER: We need to get him back immediately.\nBROYLES: Liaison. When did you get back?\nOLIVIA: I need your help. I want you to know I've successfully had Dr. Walter Bishop released from St. Claire's and he requires the use of his old laboratory.\nBROYLES: I'm sorry. What?\nOLIVIA: Kresge Building, Harvard, basement.\nBROYLES: It would be nice, to think that your tenacity in this case is a byproduct of a remarkable and robust professionalism. But I can't help but wonder, if it wasn't something going on between you and Agent Scott.\nOLIVIA: Get the lab for Bishop.\n(Someone turns on the lights at the Lab. Walter, Olivia, Peter and Astrid enter the room.)\nWALTER: (to himself): So much. So much happened here.\nWALTER: (To the others) And so much is about to.\nOLIVIA: Dr. Bishop, I've ordered a standard forensics' work package. Is there anything else you need?\nWALTER: Optical coherence tomograph for flesh study. Two thousand pounds of silicon. At least five anonymous blood samples from volunteer donors, micro-organism detector. NASA grade, of course. There's still NASA, yes?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: Oh, she's still here. This tank was the best. And a two-Year-old bos taurus.\nASTRID: A what?\nPETER: A cow. He wants a cow.\nWALTER: Purebred, not a crossbred, this is important. Mature weight 850 pounds, total fat average 2.37.\nOLIVIA: Is he joking?\nPETER: Genetically, humans and cows are separated by only a couple lines of DNA. So, what's an ethical test subject?\nOLIVIA: Where'd you learn that? MIT?\nPETER: No actually, I picked that up reading books. You should try it sometime. It's fun.\nOLIVIA: (to Astrid) Get him the cow.\nWALTER: Fantastic, thank you. Only thing better than a cow is a human. Unless you need milk. Then you really need a cow.\n(Activity including Walter examining laboratory slides; Olivia reviewing photos of Flight victims; an unidentified, and unrelated, class in session; and the arrival of the cow.)\nPETER: Coffee?\nOLIVIA: Thanks.\nPETER: Tell me. What else did that file say? About yours truly. How bad was it?\nOLIVIA: I'm not at liberty to discuss it.\nPETER: Why don't you go ahead and liberate yourself because I'm here now, so I kinda feel like I deserve the truth, don't you?\n(Olivia looks at Peter without speaking.)\nPETER: There was no file.\nOLIVIA: I needed you back here.\nPETER: So that was what? You were bluffing?\nOLIVIA: I was desperate.\nPETER: Yeahh, I'm usually pretty good at reading people. That's sorta what I do.\nOLIVIA: Yeahh, well I could see you were in trouble. Anyone could see that.\nPETER: So I could have stayed. I could have stayed in Iraq.\nOLIVIA: You know, a car bomb went of this morning in Kirkuk. You just might owe me a \"Thank you\".\nPETER: Yeahh, well, I owe a lot.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I figured. Mafia.\nPETER: A guy named Big Eddie. I swear to you I'm not making that up.\nOLIVIA: You owe money to a guy nick-named Big Eddie?\nPETER: No, I owe money to a guy named Big Eddie. He had it legally changed. And the thing is, I'm not even a gambler. I mean I never was. It's just ... A couple of years ago I went a bit crazy.\nOLIVIA: I thought you were a genius, you must have had a system.\nPETER: Of course there was a system. The House was cheating. But you try telling them that.\nWALTER: (in background) Seventy-two, during Vietnam, DOD's BioChem Division had us working on a protocontagion for a possible use against Vietcong. It's possible that whatever affected that plane may have been derived from that work.\nOLIVIA: What about John?\nWALTER: What's affecting him is merely a chemical reaction to the raw laboratory ingredients. Not the finished contagent, which means we can synthesize a counter-agent.\nOLIVIA: So you can help him?\nPETER: Don't do that. Don't give her false hope.\nWALTER: It's not false. It's not false; It's real. I could help, yes, if I had a precise inventory of what was in that storage facility when it detonated.\nOLIVIA: We don't have it. It all went up, everything. And the suspect who might have those answers got away and John was the only one who saw his face. So how long does he have left?\nWALTER: Current rate of crystallization, cellular degradation,...\nOLIVIA: How long?\nWALTER: Twenty-four hours. His brain will no longer be able to oxygenate itself. I'm so sorry. That I can't offer you a less dangerous solution.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nWALTER: Didn't I mention it?\nPETER: Whatever you think you said, you didn't say.\nWALTER: Synaptic transfer system, shared dream state.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean 'shared dream state'?\nWALTER: Human brain generates a quantifiable electric field. I hypothesized in 1976 that it is possible to synchronize the fields of two distinct minds to allow the sharing of information across the unconscious state, like a string between two tin cans.\nPETER: You know what's great about that is that it's completely insane.\nOLIVIA: You're saying I can talk to John in coma? And he can tell me what the suspect looks like?\nWALTER: It's not an exact science.\nPETER: It's not even science.\nOLIVIA: Have you done this before?\nWALTER: I have used this technique to extract information from a corpse once. You can do that if they haven't been dead for longer than six hours.\nPETER: Right, because after six hours - that's when they are really dead.\nOLIVIA: You could access his memories?\nWALTER: Assuming there's no brain damage. Of course you'd have to have an electromagnetic probe placed in the base of your skull, whilE immersed without clothing in the old tank. And you'd be heavily drugged.\nOLIVIA: What sort of drugs?\nWALTER: Mix of Ketamine, neurontin, lysergic acid diethylamide.\nPETER: That last one is LSD, by the way. Acid.\nWALTER: It would take at least a few hours, I'd need your help to synthesize it, if it's not too much trouble.\nPETER: Yeah, sure, no problem. That sounds like fun.\nPETER: (to Olivia) The man who was just released from a mental institution, he wants to give you a drug overdose and stick a metal rod into your head and put you naked into a rusty tank of water.\nWALTER: No, I don't want to. No, I'd rather not, I'm just saying I can.\nPETER: Okay, Olivia, excuse me for a second. You're obviously under severe duress and you haven't slept since Iraq and the man you care about might die, but I'm telling you, that man will kill you!\nWALTER: You don't understand the procedure.\nOLIVIA: John would do it for me...Set it up. I'll get DHS's authorization to bring John here.\nPETER: This is unbelievable. This is insane; he is insane and you're insane for following him.\nWALTER: Excellent. Let's make some LSD.\nOLIVIA: (to ambulance attendants) Put him over here.\nASTRID: (to Olivia) Salt will make you float.\nOLIVIA: Charlie. Did you get me in to see William Bell?\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Massive Dynamics isn't exactly being forthcoming or courteous. And apparently William Bell is out of the country for the next two weeks.\nOLIVIA: What's this?\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: A sweet little memo from their General Council.\nOLIVIA: So Bell doesn't want to talk?\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Or he's just being the head of a 50 billion dollar corporation.\nOLIVIA: Screw this! I want to drive a tank through William Bell's office and find out what he knows.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: I know you do, but I'm here to tell you the bad news. It's going to be another 48 hours till we get a court order.\nWALTER: (to Olivia) You should probably strip to your underwear.\nWALTER: (to Charlie) Hello.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: What the hell was that?\nOLIVIA: Charlie, we don't have 24 hours. I need you to get to Bell. If Walter fails, Bell could be the only one to save us.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Olivia, what's happening here? You've cleared all this with Broyles?\nOLIVIA: Somewhat.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Somewhat doesn't sound good.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Is that a cow?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, that's Gene. Listen Charlie, I -I need you to promise me you'll do whatever you can.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Of course. You know that... Hey. Be careful.\n(Charlie looks at John's transparent body.)\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: (to himself) My god.\n(Olivia, with the help of Walter, Peter and Astrid, prepares)\nWALTER: Now, where was I? Could you tilt your head forward, please?\nPETER: I still think that this is deeply irresponsible and believe me, I would know.\nWALTER: This is an anaesthetic. If you feel normal it's working.\nPETER: Yeah, because bootlegging smack in a basement is just the picture of normalcy.\n(Walter inserts probe at base of Olivia's neck.)\nPETER: I've got you. I hope your guy is worth it.\n(Walter injects Olivia)\nWALTER: And this will rip open your consciousness.\n(Olivia enters tank.)\nWALTER: Listen, in case you don't come back, I just wanted to say before we do this...how much I appreciate what you've done. There is so many things you lose in a place like that. You lose being trusted. Strange how important that is when it's gone.\nWALTER: If you want to watch, you can come closer. You work here?\nASTRID: Yeah, I'm Astrid Farnsworth, assistant to Agent Dunham.\nWALTER: Who?\n(Astrid points at the tank containing Olivia.)\nWALTER: Oh, yes. I'm Walter...\nPETER: Bishop. Walter Bishop.\nWALTER: Yes, thank you.\nPETER: Don't mention it.\nWALTER: These are her brain rhythms. More important than most people know regarding cerebral regional interaction. Critical.\n(Walter walks to another computer display.)\nAnd these are his. As the drugs take effect, the probes will synchronize the electrical signals from both. That's what the brain is, an electrical router. Should be able to be interpreted by the other.\nPETER: Simple really, like making taffy.\nWALTER: And when the rhythms are in-sync, they should be in the same place. So to speak.\nPETER: So what do we do now?\nWALTER: Now we wait.\n(Time passes. Peter paces. A spark occurs in Olivia's consciousness.)\nPETER: What was that?\nWALTER: Should be any minute now.\n(In Olivia's dream, she is in a junk yard. Her and John's words are italicized.)\nOLIVIA: Hello? I think I'm here. I'm here!\nWALTER: Look, look, look! Almost in-sync.\n(In Olivia's dream, she is in a graveyard, then a child's room.)\nOLIVIA: John? I know this. That's my uncle's kayak. Why is it here? John? Is that you?\nJOHN SCOTT: Olivia?\nOLIVIA: John?\nPETER: What's happening?\nWALTER: She's fine.\nPETER: She's alright?\nWALTER: She's fine.\nPETER: You're sure?\nWALTER: Look. They're together.\nJOHN SCOTT: I was just thinking about you.\n(Olivia and John embrace while standing on a finished floor in a desert. They kiss. The encephalogram shows a spike.)\nPETER: What was that?\n(Walter smiles.)\nWALTER: Nothing.\nOLIVIA: John, you were hurt.\nJOHN SCOTT: I don't remember.\nOLIVIA: Think. The storage units.\nJOHN SCOTT: I feel cold.\nOLIVIA: I need you to remember.\nJOHN SCOTT: Remember what?\nOLIVIA: What you saw. I need you to show me his face.\nJOHN SCOTT: Why?\nOLIVIA: So I can save you. Please try. Try and remember. Yes. This is right.\nJOHN SCOTT: \"We've got a runner in the back. We need him alive.\"\nOLIVIA: I can't see his face.\n(Olivia sees the face. Walter and Peter pull her out of the tank.)\nWALTER: You're late!\nOLIVIA: (gasping) I saw him. I saw John get hurt. I was there. I was there, I swear. I saw him.\n(Olivia is working in a facial recognition program.)\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: What do you mean you saw him? Where?\nOLIVIA: I told you not to ask me that.\n(Olivia makes selections in the program.)\nOLIVIA: This is him. This is the suspect we are looking for. He looks like this.\nAGENT DAWSON: Send me the image, I'll put it through the database.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Have you slept? You look like crap.\nAGENT DAWSON: No primary matches for criminal record.\nOLIVIA: Cross check all state driver's license files and send this image to all local hospitals.\nAGENT #1: Agent Dunham, take a look at this.\nOLIVIA: Oh my God. This is him.\n(he shows her a photo of Morgan Steig to Olivia.)\nAGENT #1: He was a passenger on Flight 627.\nOLIVIA: I don't understand.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: Wait. He couldn't been in the storage place.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, I saw him there.\nAGENT DAWSON: Hold on guys. Morgan Steig was passenger number 108. His emergency contact, Richard Steig.\n(Woman shows a photo of Richard Steig to Olivia.)\nOLIVIA: You're telling me he has a twin?\nAGENT DAWSON: Yeah. No home address. Only history of employment.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: What?\n(Olivia shows report to Charlie.)\nOLIVIA: Richard Steig's last employer.\nOLIVIA: I was hoping to speak with William Bell.\nNINA: I'm Nina Sharp, Executive Director. I only have a few minutes.\nOLIVIA: Our primary suspect is a former employee of yours, Richard Steig, who may have used research from your company to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin. We don't know why or for whom, but it appears he was willing to sacrifice his own brother. Whatever killed those people on that plane got onboard through his insulin pen. So, do you want to talk to me?\nNINA: (to her assistant) Danielle, please assemble everything we have on Richard Steig for Agent Dunham here.\nNINA: (to Olivia) I remember Richard Steig. He worked in our Weapons System Research lab. He was caught three months ago trying to leave the premises with classified information. He was terminated immediately. We referred his name to the Justice Department. We have done our do diligence, Agent Dunham. And, if you choose to drag our company and Dr. Bell's name into this matter, you will be hearing from our attorneys.\nOLIVIA: How long have you worked for Dr. Bell?\nNINA: Sixteen years. I owe Massive Dynamics my life and that is not an exaggeration. I was a runner most of my life. In the '97 Boston Marathon, I felt strangely tired. One day at the office Dr. Bell noticed my discomfort and insisted I go for a CAT Scan. Cancer. Spread so severely I had to have my arm amputated that week. (removes a skin-like cover exposing her bionic arm) That first scanner that found my cancer was built by this company. The robotic assist tools that were used at my surgery, the drugs I took afterwards, were developed and manufactured by Massive Dynamics. And my replacement limb was designed by Bell himself.\n(Nina's Assistant returns and hands a file to Nina, who passes it to Olivia)\nNINA: Everything we have on Richard Steig. Do you believe that Steig may be part of the \"Pattern\"?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, part of the... Part of the \"Pattern?\"\nNINA: I assumed you had clearance.\nOLIVIA: I'm cleared to know whatever you're cleared to know, miss Sharp.\nNINA: Apparently not.\nBut suffice to say that we reached the point where science and technology have advanced at such an exponential rate for so long, it may be way beyond our ability to regulate and control them. You should know what you're getting into, Agent Dunham. I would say this to my own daughter: \"Be careful and good luck.\"\nWALTER: And this is a show for children?\nASTRID: Yeah, it's huge.\nWALTER: Surprisingly profound for a narrative about a sponge.\n(Peter's cell phone rings)\nPETER: Crazy House.\nOLIVIA: I just landed at Logan, I'm on my way to you. I think we located our suspect.\nPETER: Hold on a second, you found the guy? You found the guy from your dream?\nOLIVIA: I'm picking you both up. I need your father there to question, get whatever information he needs so he can make a cure for John and I need you there too, in case your father is...\nPETER: Say no more, we'll meet you out front.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Stake out is on, you're outside.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Stand by.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Confirm your position.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Two minutes out.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: ...perimeter two miles back.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: \"Everybody where are you at?\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: Coming out.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: (to female evacuee) This way, ma'am.\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: \"Stand aside!\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: FBI!\nUNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICERS: Clear! Clear! Clear!\n(Walter and Peter are sitting in a car.)\nWALTER: I'd like to check your blood pressure.\nPETER: Why don't you check your own blood pressure? Mine is fine, thanks.\nWALTER: Your skin tone suggest you might be suffering from arterial hypertension.\nPETER: Don't tell me what I'm suffering from. And there are no visible signs of hypertension.\nWALTER: When this is over, please don't send me back. I don't want to go back.\nPETER: Look, Walter.\nWALTER: This experience... It woke me up again and you can't put me back to sleep.\nPETER: It was hardly my idea. Any of it.\nWALTER: Whatever punishment you think I deserve, I swear I have already endured it. Seventeen years. Please, son.\n(Peter sees Steig exiting building.)\nPETER: Hey! Hey!\nWALTER: What?\nPETER: Hey! He's in the alley!\nWALTER: Can I get out of the car?\nPETER: Stay right there Walter.\n(Olivia, Peter and others chase Steig through an alley, a park, a building and another alley before Peter tackles Steig.)\nOLIVIA: I've got some questions for you.\nOLIVIA:\nRICHARD STEIG: I have nothing to say.\n(Olivia leaves the interrogation room. Peter, who has been watching on a monitor, enters the room.)\nPETER: The compound the Infected Agent Scott..., it's water soluble, right? We might not know what it is, but we know what it does. That means that, if I wanted to, I could extract the contaminated fluids from his body. That would allow me to slip to you any time I wanted to. In your food, a cup of coffee, in the toilet, nobody would ever know how it happened. (Pause.) The only problem is, that woman who was just in here, that's her friend who's dying. The only problem is, I don't have that kind of time.\n(Steig lunges. Peter grabs his arm and smashes a heavy coffee mug into Steig's hand. Steig screams in pain. Olivia bursts into the room.)\nPETER: Tell me the chemicals! Now!\nOLIVIA: No, you can't. You can't do that!\nPETER: (To Olivia.) You can't; I can.\nPETER: (To Steig.) I'm gonna count to one.... One!\n(Peter grabs his arm and smashes a heavy coffee mug into Steig's hand a second time. Steig screams again.)\nWALTER: The active toxin was a magnesium-based ethylene glycol.\nPETER: No, I understand that, but you're not listening.\nWALTER: Magnesium ethylene glycol with organophosphate trigger.\nPETER: Look, Walter, just stop for a second. His blood won't be able to absorb it before the side effects kill him.\nWALTER: And you're saying what? We synthesize a calcium gluconate in a thiamine base?\nPETER: Yes, exactly.\nWALTER: We can't, we'd need more of his blood. We have none.\nOLIVIA: That's not true. All agents are required to set up a backup blood supply in case we're wounded.\nWALTER: Autologous transfusion. That's brilliant.\nPETER: We can create the antidote and then just dissolve it in stored blood. If we transfuse him intravenously, his body won't be overwhelmed.\nWALTER: A-plus, Boy. Well done. Let's begin.\n(Walter and Peter begin preparing the antidote. John's frozen blood arrives.)\n(Broyles and Olivia are on a floor above the Lab. As they talk, Olivia sits and Broyles joins her.)\nBROYLES: So, I got the lab.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I know you did. Thanks.\nBROYLES: How's it going downstairs?\nOLIVIA: Bishop says it'll be a while, but that it's looking \"auspicious.\" That was his word... What?\nBROYLES: You've done some solid work here. Locating Bishop. Getting him out, finding a way to get him to work with you. We're impressed.\nOLIVIA: Who's we?\nBROYLES: What happened on that plane might be part of something more dangerous than simple terrorism.\nOLIVIA: Simple terrorism?\nBROYLES: In the past nine months, there'd been three dozen authenticated incidents like the Hamburg flight. Most of what I'm about to show you has not been made public. John Thompson, normal kid. Went missing back in '98. Reappeared last month half way around the world, hadn't aged a day. In the past few months, 46 other children who went missing that same year turn up. Same story. Local fishermen off the coast of Sri Lanka. Reports a low flying plane emitting a high pitched frequency that blows out all their windows. An hour later, same spot, an 8.7 subsurface earthquake creates a tsunami that kills 38,000 people.\nOLIVIA: So why are you telling me this?\nBROYLES: This man. A patient in Lisbon who woke up after years in a coma. Began writing, just numbers. They turn out to be exact real time coordinates of our Carrier Battle Groups in the Pacific. Intel that's classified above Top Secret.\nOLIVIA: So how is that even possible?\nBROYLES: Come work for me and I'll get you the clearance...\nOLIVIA: Stop!\nBROYLES: Dunham, there is more you need to hear.\nOLIVIA: You must not have heard me, I said stop.\nBROYLES: They're calling these events \"The Pattern.\" As if someone out there is experimenting, only the whole world is their lab. You've seen it now. You know.\nOLIVIA: I don't want to know. I have a job.\nBROYLES: This is a more important job. Anything, anybody you need you can have.\nOLIVIA: I like the job I've got. And the man I do it with, which you seem have deduced on your own.\nBROYLES: Look around. You see all these people going about their lives? No idea what's happening around them and what they're in the middle of?\nOLIVIA: I just want to go back to before.\nBROYLES: Dunham, I don't think you can.\n(Walter and Peter mix the chemical compound required to save John's life. The frozen blood arrives. Peter injects the compound into the IV system.)\nWALTER: He's up. He's awake.\nPETER: Olivia, he's awake. He's conscious!\nOLIVIA: John? John? Can you hear me, baby? Baby?\nJOHN SCOTT: I had a dream about you.\nOLIVIA: Hi. Change of clothes for Agent Scott.\nDR. REYES: His vitals are surprisingly strong.\nOLIVIA: So, how long does he have to stay?\nDR. REYES: Until the melanoma sites in his skin are regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week. He owes you his life.\nOLIVIA: We owe each other. What room is Steig in?\n(Olivia enter Steig's hospital room.)\nRICHARD STEIG: I told you everything I know, didn't I? And I gave you the names of all the synthetics I used in the compound.\nOLIVIA: Don't worry. Our immunity agreement holds. But there's still a whole lot more we have to talk about, like why you killed your own brother. And who you're selling your work to?\nRICHARD STEIG: Who said I was selling it? I was threatened by a guy from your office. You think I'm lying? I swear to God, I can prove it.\nOLIVIA: Where's the recording?\nRICHARD STEIG: I buried it.\n(Olivia digs a package containing a small cassette tape out of the ground, enters her car and listens to the tape.)\nJOHN SCOTT: (on tape) (Indistinguishable)\nRICHARD STEIG: (on tape) ...the airplane was a demonstration.\nJOHN SCOTT: (on tape) You've drawn unwarranted attention to something we can't afford to be connected with. I'll make this simple. You're not selling to anyone else. You do that, we will come after you. I will come after you.\nRICHARD STEIG: (on tape) You're threatening me? After seeing what I'm willing to do to my own brother?\nJOHN SCOTT: (on tape) Let me assure you we'd be happy to treat you as family too.\n(Olivia has brief flashback and remembers John saying those words on his cell phone as he arrived at the Logan tarmac to invistigate Flight 627.)\n(John sits up in bed and removes his monitoring leads. After dressing he walks to a restricted hall in the hospital.)\nJOHN SCOTT: Special Agent Scott.\nUNIDENTIFIED GUARD: Yes. Sir. Go in.\n(John finds Steig and smothers him)\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone driving fast) Charlie, I need two agents posted outside agent Scott's room. Check on Steig.\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: I'm on it.\nOLIVIA: I'm five minutes away.\n(Charlie walks in and finds Steig dead in bed)\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: We need this place locked down!\n(Arriving at the hospital entrance, Olivia spies Johns' vehicle accelerating out of a side lot.)\nOLIVIA: This is Dunham, Agent I.D. 5-2-7-7-6. in pursuit of blue S.U.V., heading south on Fenway. Need immediate assist.\n(A car chase ensues. John crashes and is dying a bloody death.)\nJOHN SCOTT: Ask yourself, why... why Broyles sent you... to the storage facility. Why you?\nOLIVIA: I don't understand. Who are you working for? John, tell me. Tell me more. John.\n(John dies... Olivia copes... cries... driving with Charlie afterwards)\nCHARLIE FRANCIS: I knew him just as long as you did. I'm sorry. Job isn't what it was ten years ago. We're supposed to protect the world, where one breath of the wrong air can incinerate you from the inside out. I mean, how do we protect people, when corporations have higher security clearances than we do? When we're not fully briefed on half the things that we're investigating. You know, when the truth, the truth is - we're obsolete.\nOLIVIA: Take me back to the lab.\nOLIVIA: Can I talk to you please?\nPETER: Yeah. (to Walter) I'll be back in a second.\nOLIVIA: I'm sure you're anxious to get as far away from here as possible. To Iraq or Afghanistan, or some other out of reach places. But I'm here to tell you that your father needs to stay, which means that you need to... too.\nPETER: Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I know you have countless reasons as to why this is a non-starter for you. But your father is a good man. He's not the monster you think he is and you're good with him despite what you think. And you're the only one who speaks Walter. We take him back to St. Claire's it's all over.\nPETER: Where's John?\nOLIVIA: I can talk to the Agency and get them to clear your gambling debt.\nPETER: I can take care of my own debts, okay? What just happened? Where's John?\nOLIVIA: I'm not gonna use false threats with you anymore. I don't need to. The threats are real.\nPETER: After you left my father sat down, started talking to me and he was remarkably lucid. He told me about the work that he and William Bell have done in their experiments and that incident. What happened on that plane is just the beginning. Which makes every part of me feel like I gotta get the hell out of Boston.\nWALTER: (interjects) Are we leaving?\n(John Scott's body is prone on a gurney)\nNINA: How long has he been dead?\nMAN WITH GURNEY: Five hours.\nNINA: Question him.\n(the attendant pushes the gurney into a room behind a secure door.)"

'cause I could really go for a mushroom pizza.\nCHRISTOPHER PENROSE: Yeah, it's a mushroom pizza.\nLORAINE ALCOTT: Awesome. (as he dresses in the bathroom) You're not married, are you? Not that it's any of my business. Well, you never know about people. My name isn't Amber, by the way, obviously. That's just for the club.

Give me a scalpel. (quietly) Alright, come on. Alright. Right there. Okay. (pulling a groaning infant through the incision)\nNURSE #1: Oh, God.\nDOCTOR STEEL: Dear God.\nNURSE #2: Aaahh!\n(to a small group of professional looking men and women in a well-appointed briefing room)\nBROYLES: Thank you all for convening at this late hour. Forty-three minutes ago, we were alerted to an incident at the Wallace Bromley Medical Center. While the details are still coming in, it appears to be another anomaly whose mysteries and origins remains the sole purpose of this committee. I called you together tonight to introduce you to my new team, who will now be responsible for investigating all these events. (personnel files are reviewed by attendees) Hopefully, they will have more success than our last. (briefs from large monitor) Walter Bishop, dubbed by his contemporaries as a successor to Albert Einstein, worked for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency from the late '70s...\nNINA: \u2026until he was committed to the Saint Claire's mental institution for manslaughter.\nBROYLES: He was never convicted of that crime.\nNINA: But in one of your own reports, you theorize that Bishop's previous work may itself be the root of all these unexplained phenomenon.\nBROYLES: Given that he's been hugging a padded cell for 17 years\u2026 I think we can probably exclude him as a suspect, however, his knowledge makes him uniquely qualified to assist our efforts while he remains in the legal custody of his son Peter.\nNINA: Yes, Peter Bishop, whose history of questionable business practices verge on fraud, yet you propose giving him access to information that, if made public, would cause mass panic.\nBROYLES: There's nothing we could tell him that he can't learn from his father or deduce himself, with a 190 IQ.\nNINA: What were you thinking when you recruited Olivia Dunham? An FBI Agent who had an illicit affair with her partner, a man who turned out to be a traitor.\nBROYLES: I was thinking that a woman who didn't hesitate to follow the evidence and expose the man she loved at the cost of great personal pain and embarrassment - must surely be worthy of our trust.\n(at home studying files \u2013 then in flashback)\nJOHN: (to Olivia) I love you.\n(reviewing classified files \u2013 again in flashback)\nOLIVIA: (to injured John) Who? Who are you working for?\n(continues reading \u2013 answers cell phone)\nOLIVIA: Hello?\nBROYLES: Wake up\u2026 there's something you need to see.\nOLIVIA: Well, waking up's not gonna be a problem, but thank you for the gentle nudge.\nBROYLES: Pick up the others and meet me in thirty minutes at the Bromley Medical Center. (hangs-up)\nOLIVIA: (aloud to herself) A good morning to you too.\n(minutes later at the Bishop\u2019s hotel. knocking on the door)\nPETER: (opens door) You're kiddin' me, right?\nOLIVIA: Your phone was off the hook.\nPETER: That's 'cause I didn't want to get woken up.\nOLIVIA: You need to get your father. Apparently there's something we need to see.\nPETER: And this something--\nOLIVIA: It can't wait.\nPETER: Okay. Walter. Hey, Walter, come on, we're - Walter? Oh come on. Tell me you're not in the closet. What the hell are you doing in there again?\nWALTER: Where I've been for the past seventeen years is a mental hospital.\nPETER: St. Claire's. I'm the one that got you out of that place, remember?\nWALTER: There was a patient there. Carlos. He would sing \u2018row, row, row your boat\u2019 every night. Funny how difficult it is to sleep without that song.\nPETER: That's nice. We gotta go Walter.\n(getting out the vehicle)\nOLIVIA: Hey, I got here as fast as we could.\nBROYLES: Twenty-seven minutes. Nicely done. Peter Bishop. (shakes hands) I'm Philip Broyles, Department of Homeland Security. Thank you for agreeing to work with us.\nPETER: Just to be clear, I haven't agreed to anything. I'm just here as the babysitter. My father is the one you want.\nBROYLES: Nice to meet you anyway. Is he coming out?\nPETER: Well, that's unclear. He's currently in the car fiddling around with his seat warmer.\nBROYLES: (through open window) Doctor Bishop, hello. I appreciate you coming out tonight.\nWALTER: I've never seen a feature like this before. It warms your ass. It's wonderful. Have you tried it? (walking the halls of the hospital)\nBROYLES: Seventeen past midnight, a woman\u2026 pregnant to term, was found alone outside the hospital. She collapsed, suffering severe abdominal pain. She's a Jane Doe. Prints and D.N.A. are being run now. Should have her I.D.\u2019d by sundown. At twelve twenty-four, less than two minutes after she was pronounced dead, Ms. Doe became a mother.\nOLIVIA: Did the baby survive?\nBROYLES: The newborn was convulsing. screaming in obvious pain. They placed it in a bassinet, we\u2019re in the process of transferring it to an intensive care when they realized what was happening. It was growing... before their eyes.\nOLIVIA: Growing? You mean they could... see it getting larger?\nBROYLES: That's right.\nOLIVIA: So where's the baby now?\nPETER: Walter!\nBROYLES: It remained alive for nearly half an hour, this way. Finally dying from natural causes.\nOLIVIA: Natural causes? I don't understand.\nBROYLES: What they realized is that the child wasn't just growing. It was aging.\nPETER: Oh - okay, hold on a sec. It's 4:00 A.M. so I'm a little foggy, but we're supposed to believe that grandpa here was born four hours ago?\nOLIVIA: Were there any calls or tips? Did the security cameras see how the pregnant woman got here? Did she drive herself or was she dropped off?\nBROYLES: We're checking those now. Doctor Bishop, any idea how something like this might happen?\nPETER: I think you're probably expecting a bit much, Mister Broyles.\nWALTER: \u2026Celermitosis. Disabling, reversing cell cycle inhibitors - activating them and turning CIP\/KIP and INKA 4a\/ARFs into catalysts\u2026 uh, ninety-two percent of caucasian newborns have blue eyes. (to Peter) Yours were green. (to all) To understand what happened here, I'll need to run extensive tests, get these bodies to a lab. Therefore, of course, I'll need a lab immediately.\nBROYLES: Doctor, you have one. Your old lab at Harvard\u2026 we reopened it for you. Do you not remember that?\nWALTER: No. No, but that's fantastic news!\n(in Dunham\u2019s office)\nPETER: Alright, let's assume for a second that bundle of joy here is for real. What are we doing here?\nBROYLES: A series of events has occurred, continues to occur, that has us and other agencies on alert. These events appear to be scientific in nature and suggest a larger strategy, a coordinated effort. It's been referred to as \u2018The Pattern.\u2019\nPETER: Mister Broyles, I consider myself a fairly intelligent guy. But I'm not following you here.\nOLIVIA: Inexplicable and frightening things are happening and there's a connection somehow.\nPETER: Thanks. That much, I understand.\nASTRID: I got Henning on the phone. The hospital got a call from a guest at the Scarlet Red Motel, checking to see if the pregnant woman was doing okay.\nOLIVIA: Was she staying there?\nASTRID: Yes, with a caucasian male - 20\u2019s, brown hair\u2026 but there's no description of him or the car he was driving.\nOLIVIA: Well call the motel - make sure they don't touch anything. They shouldn't even go in.\nASTRID: I already called, and you're good to go. The motel room's empty and locked.\nOLIVIA: Doctor Bishop? I may need you to take samples from the motel room. I need you to come with me. Walter.\nWALTER: (over the corpse) Do you see what I'm doing here?!\nPETER: Hey... relax.\nWALTER: I can't figure this out with a girl buzzing in my ear. I am trying to put these pieces together like a puzzle. How this happened, how he happened to her. I'm working.\nPETER: Come on, Olivia. I can do this. My limited stint at M.I.T. did teach me something. (the two depart the lab)\nOLIVIA: Loraine Daisy Alcott.\nPETER: Loraine Daisy\u2026 that's just sad.\nOLIVIA: One 'r'.\nPETER: (from the bathroom) Hey. I think I actually got something to sample in here. It's some kind of orange gel. I'm sorry about my father. He always was a little myopic.\nOLIVIA: Her things were left behind, but not his. (inspects the bed)\nPETER: Checking the thread count?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Open the cabinet.\nPETER: Why?\nOLIVIA: There are gonna be sheets in there.\nPETER: Okay, how'd you do that? (she marches out of the room upset, he follows)\nPETER: Hey! Car's right here. Olivia, what's going on?\nOLIVIA: That's what he would do. He'd go to motels ahead of time, to replace the sheets with leak-proof medical grade linen, so he wouldn't leave any blood evidence.\nPETER: Who?\nOLIVIA: I know who was in that room. The killer. I know who's profile. It was a case that John and I worked. Serial murders in New Jersey and New York, and we never caught him.\nPETER: Look, you can't beat yourself up 'cause you didn't catch the bastard on your first try.\nOLIVIA: I feel like I've been asleep for the last year. Every case that John and I worked together, I have to go back and try and find whatever I missed.\nPETER: Okay, then, tell me... how'd the killer do it?\nOLIVIA: When I joined the F.B.I., this was one of the cases John and I investigated together. Each time, he'd kill five young women within a few days. He'd pick them up, take them to motels... and then he'd give them a muscle paralyzer. They'd be wide awake, but unable to move. He's make an incision here, along their gums. And then he'd pull their mouths open up to their eyes.\nPETER: Okay, that's enough. You can stop right there.\nOLIVIA: He'd go through their nasal cavity and remove a piece of their brain.\nPETER: And all of this connects to magic old man baby and the pregnant woman... how?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. But there's a connection somewhere. The muscle paralyzer he used was bright orange. So if that's our sample, then I'm telling you, this is our guy. Which means - he's gonna kill again.\n(Stacy spots Christopher Penrose entering and quickly finds her way to his side)\nSTACY: (softly, coy) I'm Stacy.\nCHARLIE: (to a briefing full of Agents) Memorial services for Agent Scott are being planned for late in the week. I know everybody's heard a lot of things surrounding the circumstances of his death, but I just want to be clear - John Scott was one of us\u2026 and we will pay him the respect of considering him innocent until the inquiry can establish the full facts of the matter. (notices Olivia waiting) Now, as far as any contacts, our official word right now is no comment. Dismissed.\n(walking away from room with Olivia)\nCHARLIE: What are you doing here?\nOLIVIA: I left you a message.\nCHARLIE: I know, I got it. You want to open up a twelve year-old serial case. The brain surgeon.\nOLIVIA: I don't think he retired.\nCHARLIE: How long is Broyles going to have you on special assignment? What the hell are you working on anyway?\nOLIVIA: You knew, didn't you? About me and John?\nCHARLIE: I like to think that I have some powers of deduction.\nOLIVIA: I took advantage of our friendship. You kept quiet, even though you didn't approve.\nCHARLIE: I hadn't seen you that happy in a long time. Look, Olivia, you have nothing to prove.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I do. I have to live with the fact that I didn't see him for who he really was. I have to live with the feeling that whatever awful things he did, I should have stopped them.\nCHARLIE: Livy, you can...\nOLIVIA: \u2026 mostly just wanna take a shower from the inside out.\nCHARLIE: I'll get you the case files. (walks off)\n(parks at an unoccupied warehouse)\nSTACY: So, I - I started working there a couple weeks ago. It's a lot better than the one in Providence. That place is a total dive. Most guys bring me to a hotel. Wow, heh. Look at this place.\nCHRISTOPHER PENROSE: Those windows have a really great view of the bridge.\nSTACY: I don't care about the bridge. What do you like?\nCHRISTOPHER PENROSE: I like the bridge. Go check it out.\n(she walks to the window, he secretly prepares a syringe, kisses her and injects her)\nSTACY: Agh! Ah...uhh!\nPETER: Hello?\nWALTER: Over here. Over here! (sits milking a cow)\nPETER: What are you doing?\nWALTER: I'm doing two things at once. I'm waiting for you - and I'm doing her a favor.\nPETER: You were supposed to be doing extensive testing\u2026 eighty year-old \u2018man- baby\u2019... remember that?\nWALTER: Done. Test is complete. You underestimate me. Which I suppose I deserve. But... wonderful news all around. D.N.A. results confirm my suspicions that the woman was impregnated by a man who is the result of experiments identical to those conducted by me in this very lab around 30 years ago.\nPETER: So you know how this happened?\nWALTER: No. No idea. The specifics elude me completely.\nPETER: So then what's this wonderful news?\nWALTER: Because I remembered something else. I remembered where I parked my car.\nPETER: Really? You remember where you parked your car 17 years ago?\n(opening the combo lock on the door)\nWALTER: 3-1-4-1-5-9. Tuh! Ha!\nPETER: Pi to six digits.\nWALTER: I can't fathom that it's still here. Look at it.\nPETER: This is your car? (Vista Cruiser station wagon) Of course it is. So what, you got cars stuffed with papers all over town?\nWALTER: Not just cars. You have no idea where I've hidden things.\nPETER: Friend of yours? (holds up a severed hand in preserved in a jar)\nWALTER: Oh... I certainly hope not. Come on, boy, we need to get these file boxes back to the lab.\nPETER: You may be able to reanimate dead guinea pigs or... whatever, but I can bring anything mechanical back from the dead.\n(hauling in boxes of files)\nASTRID: This is the last of them.\nWALTER: That'll do. Hello, I'm Doctor Walter Bishop.\nASTRID: Yes, Doctor Bishop. We've met. I'm Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth.\nPETER: (to Astrid) Third time's a charm. Now, Walter, we'd probably be a lot more help to you if you told us what we were looking for.\nWALTER: My research. Sella Turcica - Diaphragma Sellae - the dural folds of the Pituitary Fossa in which the pituitary gland sits, situated in the sphenoid bone.\nOLIVIA: Did you just say pituitary gland?\nWALTER: Did I?\nOLIVIA: Well, that's how he killed. He'd perform surgery on his victims, remove the pituitary gland before he overdosed them with anesthesia.\nWALTER: Look for anything with the pituitary in it.\nASTRID: I'm sorry. I don't get it. I mean, what's the link to what happened at the hospital?\nWALTER: Advanced, rapid aging, like the disease called Progeria, can be induced artificially by manipulating the pituitary gland. \u2018P\u2019- pituitary. \u2018P\u2019,\u2018P\u2019,\u2018P\u2019.\nPETER: All the hormones in the human body that control growth, which is aging really, are in the brain. And the pituitary gland is the boss.\nWALTER: \u2018P\u2019 Okay. Pinoche, pinto. Penny--oh. Ah, yes\u2026\nOLIVIA: Progeria.\nWALTER: \u2026Penny.\nOLIVIA: Case file by Doctor Penrose?\nWALTER: Yes, Penrose.\nWALTER: Penrose! I remember him. A former colleague of mine. Although he suffered from severe pseudo-folliculitis nuchae.\nPETER: Razor burn.\nWALTER: He\u2019ll know! We ran experiments on rapid growth. Obviously, someone had made a breakthrough, and Penrose could possibly lead us to that person.\nASTRID: Doctor Claus Penrose. He moved to the East Coast two years ago. He's a professor at Boston College.\nCHARLIE: Agent Francis.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, it's me.\nCHARLIE: Dunham. What's up?\nOLIVIA: I need a cross check of recent unsolved homicides. See if any bodies have turned up with a missing pituitary gland.\nCHARLIE: Oh, you say the sweetest things.\nOLIVIA: Only to you, Charlie.\nCHARLIE: I'll get somebody on it.\n(a victim lays on a makeshift operating table awaiting pituitary extraction, Christopher Penrose approaches with a scalpel)\n(walking in)\nOLIVIA: Doctor Penrose.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: Yes?\nOLIVIA: Agent Dunham, FBI. (flashing credentials) Can we ask you a few questions?\nCLAUSE PENROSE: (flatly) Do you drink tea?\n(sitting in his office)\nOLIVIA: The body you see there was photographed only hours after being born.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: Where is the mother?\nOLIVIA: She died during childbirth. When she was admitted, she claimed she wasn't even pregnant. You worked with Doctor Bishop, manipulating growth hormones at the end of the Vietnam war.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: Yes. So... what can I do for you?\nOLIVIA: In the years since, have you shared your research with anyone?\nCLAUSE PENROSE: I must tell you both, our work was\nPETER: (interrupting) - highly theoretical?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: But I was going to say that\u2026 more than anything, it was wrong. I resigned from the employ of the United States Government after only one year. When I refused to continue, I was harassed. Threatened... with deportation. It...didn't feel like the America I remembered - from when I was a boy. Which is why... as sorry as I was to hear about Doctor Bishop's incarceration, I believe it was the best thing that could ever happen to humanity. No one in power should ever learn what he knows. uh... forgive me for sounding uncooperative Agent Dunham, but... my work to which you are referring ended years ago. Since then, I've done all I can to forget it.\n(departing interview for vehicle)\nOLIVIA: What do you think?\nPETER: I think you know what I think.\nOLIVIA: Well, he meant what he said.\nPETER: He's not telling us everything.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: (from his office) Dudbury Police has a blonde female victim. Surgical incision along her upper gum line. The central endocrine gland has been removed\u2026 This count?\nOLIVIA: Can you get the body brought to the lab?\nCHARLIE: Will do.\nOLIVIA: (enters with Peter) Astrid called. She said you have news.\nWALTER: You're right. The pituitary gland has indeed been removed - and I may be able to posit a hypothesis as to why. Years ago, when I worked with the Defense Department, we were tasked with a program designed to cultivate soldiers.\nOLIVIA: Cultivate?\nWALTER: Quite literally. Grow them. It was highly theoretical, of course. Female eggs were to be fertilized in a lab and given a cocktail of growth hormones. If perfected, a baby was born and within three years aged to the equivalent of a 21-year-old male. A soldier in prime condition.\nPETER: You're telling me you developed a way to grow soldiers - people.\nWALTER: Theoretically. The only problem was how to slow the aging process once the subject had reached the desired physical age. Once started, we couldn't turn the aging off.\nOLIVIA: So you think now what? That the killer somehow continued your work?\nWALTER: Not exactly. But I believe that someone has made a breakthrough, that the killer is the product. The test tube human afflicted with rapid aging. To slow the process, he must extract the hormones from the pituitary glands of his victims to treat himself, to stay young.\nOLIVIA: Then the pregnant woman at the hospital--\nPETER: She was an accident. And the killer's condition was passed on to the baby.\nWALTER: Even condoms are not 100% effective. You two should be aware of this. That night, he was going to kill her, but first they fornicated. Had intercourse\u2026 sex.\nPETER: Okay, we got it.\nWALTER: She became pregnant, um, but the pregnancy became horribly accelerated.\nOLIVIA: So someone must have heard her scream. And he couldn't go through with his plan. He couldn't kill her. Which is why he didn't kill this girl at a motel, because he was scared. And if his M.O.'s changed, then...we have nothing. We have to go back and start again from the beginning.\nPETER: No, this is okay. We're making progress--\nOLIVIA: Why don't you tell her that everything's going to be okay.\nWALTER: I thought you had a way with women.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: Christopher! The FBI came to see me today. I know what happened. You got that woman pregnant. Son, we have to be so careful.\nCHRISTOPHER PENROSE: I know.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: How's the pain?\nCHRISTOPHER PENROSE: Getting worse.\nCLAUSE PENROSE: Yes, well, we're almost there. You just need to get one more, and you'll be okay again.\nWALTER: Yes. Yes. Yes!\nPETER: Something on your mind?\nWALTER: Please. The term \"on your mind\" vexes me with its depictive inaccuracy.\nPETER: Aw, stop. Would you just talk like a person? What are you thinking?\nWALTER: Jules Verne.\nPETER: \u201820,000 Leagues Under The Sea\u2019 Jules Verne?\nWALTER: Yes. Although I was referring to his lesser-known masterwork, the Kip Brothers, in which he posited that the last image seen in life, right at the moment of death, is permanently imprinted on the retina of the eye.\nPETER: Also a work of fiction. Which is a small but critical distinction.\nWALTER: When was it you lost your imagination, son?\nPETER: Alright, do you want to play? Let's play. The only way that we can see what she saw, even in theory, is if we could recover the electric impulses that were traveling along her optic nerve\u2026 which we can't.\nWALTER: Ah, we're in luck. This woman was given a muscle relaxant. The drug would have frozen her neural pathways at the moment of death and the last images she saw with it.\nPETER: Okay, assuming we're actually having this conversation, we would still need a... Well, I don't know. We still need something that could translate what she saw--\nWALTER: Something that could translate from her eyes to a monitor. A TV screen. (catches-up to Olivia getting some fresh air outside)\nPETER: Hey. (sits on bench)\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry about the lab. I don't usually...\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: Lose control.\nPETER: To tell you the truth, it was kind of a relief. You've been so together with everything that's going on, I was starting to develop an inferiority complex. Knowing that Walter's work is responsible for all those murders... I just want you to know that you're not alone here. Listen... I can't believe that I'm about to propose this, but I - I think... We've actually figured out a way to track down that psycho.\nOLIVIA: How?\nPETER: Well, we need a piece of equipment. It's, uh, laser optic hardware. Very crazy and very, very hard to find. But as it turns out, only one company has the patent.\n(sitting in the waiting area - daydreaming)\nDANIELLE: Sorry for the delay Ms. Sharp will be right with you.\nBROYLES: I have reservations about asking Massive Dynamic for a favor. The corporate mind always looks for quid pro quo.\nOLIVIA: Can I ask you a question?\nBROYLES: Of course.\nOLIVIA: Before he died, Agent Scott suggested that this was more than a coincidence that you recruited me for this assignment.\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham... do you mind if I ask you a personal question about you and Agent Scott? The very last time you were... intimate... were you safe? You weren't, were you? (she becomes violently pregnant like Loraine Alcott)\nDANIELLE: (startles Olivia from her daydream) Agent Dunham? Ms. Sharp will see you now.\n(in her office)\nNINA: I hope the ride was comfortable. I'm not a big fan of airplanes myself. Despite the obvious intellectual understanding of their safety, my hands still get sweaty on takeoff.\nOLIVIA: Thank you again for your cooperation, we're very...\nNINA: (interrupts) No need to thank me. You know, I've been thinking of you - meaning to thank you for being a woman of your word and keeping Massive Dynamic out of the press. I also wanted to say... you have my sincere condolences on the loss of Agent Scott.\nOLIVIA: What do you know about Agent Scott?\nNINA: I know that he was your partner. I've lost people close to me. I know how hard that can be. Not to mention the rumor about what he was involved with. And, of course, the joy of being a female in a traditionally male line of work. No doubt some of your male colleagues are assuming that you two were intimate. (male assistant returns with case) Ah. The electronic pulse camera. Travel safely, Agent Dunham.\n(pulling eye and elongating optic stem\/nerve from its socket)\nWALTER: Are we ready? Dear, the lights. Goggles, all of you. Do not look directly into the light.\nASTRID: Are we really going to be able to see her last image?\nWALTER: Faith. Never a bad thing to have. (flashing pulses around the room \u2013 faint images on a large screen).\n(visuals of Christopher Penrose finding a new victim in a bar, then Christopher and Doctor Penrose preparing that victim for pituitary extraction in a makeshift operating room)\n(continuing the experiment in the lab)\nPETER: This is taking too long. If he's already picked up another--\nWALTER: Impatient! You always were.\nPETER: As if you ever knew me well enough to make a statement like that.\nWALTER: Huh! You're a smart boy. But there is much you don't know.\nOLIVIA: Did you see that? (improved images appear on large screen)\nPETER: What was that?\nOLIVIA: Wait, wait. What was that? Can you focus?\nWALTER: It's not a slide projector.\nPETER: Wait... Astrid, can you flip it over?\nASTRID: Yes.\nPETER: That's a bridge.\nASTRID: I know that bridge. I used to live in Denton. That's, um, that's Sargent bridge. That's in Stoughton.\nPETER: What's in Stoughton?\nOLIVIA: The warehouse district. This would be one of the last images she saw?\nWALTER: In theory, yes.\nPETER: Where would she have to have been to see that angle of the bridge?\nOLIVIA: (to Astrid) Pull up N.R.O. online\u2026 image mapping database. (images appear on computer monitor) Okay, match the angles. (refines the aspect of the image) Wait, stop. That's it. Pull out to aerial view and triangulate.\nASTRID: It looks like she's in this warehouse district. The 1600 block of Bond street.\nOLIVIA: I want satellite images of that area for the last 24 hours.\n(minutes later)\nASTRID: Street sweeper on the access road at 8:05 P.M.\nOLIVIA: I got nothing between 6:00 and 7:45 P.M.\nWALTER: (to Peter) What are we looking for, exactly?\nPETER: She died in one of these buildings.\nOLIVIA: I've got a gray sedan parked outside Unit 17 at 8:05 A.M.\nASTRID: I've got the same vehicle eight hours later.\nPETER: That's the estimated time of death of our last victim.\nOLIVIA: If you get anything more specific, call me.\nASTRID: You got it.\nWALTER: (to Peter, rushing to leave with Olivia) It worked, Peter! See that? It worked!\nOLIVIA: So Lessing... Borrow... Belmont.\nPETER: Hold on - did you say Borrow? Did we pass Borrow already?\nOLIVIA: There. (points to lit building, parks car) Stay there. (the car)\nPETER: That's just not gonna happen.\nOLIVIA: (finds Doctor Penrose in a makeshift operating room) F.B.I.! Put your hands up! I said put your hands up.\nPETER: She's alive.\nOLIVIA: (to Penrose) Is there anyone else here? (hears noise behind her - to Peter) You have your phone?\nPETER: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: (gives him her spare pistol) Dial 1-7-2-2-4. Ask for Charlie Francis. Tell him we need field assist. Tell him to ping the GPS for the location. Safety's on the right. Do not let him move. (chases after fleeing suspect) Freeze!\nPETER: (Doctor Penrose pulls electrical diversion and runs) Hey, hey! Back off! (fires pistol)\nASTRID: (answers phone in lab) Hello? (hands phone to Walter) It's Peter.\nWALTER: Just making popcorn.\nPETER: Walter, I'm with a woman in her mid-20s. She is going into cardiac arrest due to an overdose of anesthesia. Her heart just stopped.\nWALTER: Do you have any cocaine?\nPETER: Cocaine? No, I don't have any cocaine.\nWALTER: Oh, then too bad. You'll have to shock her heart.\nPETER: Yeah, I know that. unfortunately, I don't have a defibrillator!\n(Olivia pursues an agonized Christopher Penrose)\nPETER: (fashions a defibrillator from scratch) Hey, you still there?\nWALTER: Mm.\nPETER: What is the optimum voltage for cardiac resuscitation?\nWALTER: Try 200 volts.\nPETER: Alright, here it goes. (zap) It's not working.\nWALTER: Well, you'll have to crank it, won't you?\nPETER: Hey! Hey, it worked.\nWALTER: Good work, son. Good work.\nPETER: (hangs-up phone) Hey. You\u2019re gonna be okay.\n(Olivia pursues the genetically-altered Christopher beyond the warehouse, pistol drawn, hears coughing in a back alley)\nCHRISTOPHER PENROSE: (coughing and aging before our eyes) He - he should have let me die - a long time ago. I'm not... I... I was an experiment. Someone... someone paid him. The man I called my father. He should have let me die. That was his mistake. But he was blinded... Because he loved me. He loved me. He... (passes away before her stunned eyes)\nOLIVIA: Thank you again for your help.\nNINA: That's what I'm here for. I hope it served you well. I'd ask you what you wanted the camera for, but I respect your confidentiality.\nOLIVIA: Well, we're grateful for your help.\nNINA: Seems you're settling well into your new position.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me?\nNINA: I don't think a woman of your talents should be in public service.\nOLIVIA: Oh? And where should I be?\nNINA: Here, at Massive Dynamic.\nOLIVIA: You're offering me a job?\nNINA: Philip Broyles is a good man, and his record speaks for itself. Well, I'm sure you got into law enforcement because you wanted to make a difference. So consider this - Massive Dynamic is one of the ten largest economic entities in the world. Our weapons technologies shape the Defense Department's strategies. Our investments sway the markets and make or break presidential elections. Overseas, we have responsibilities traditionally sacred to the state. The right to direct private armies, to manage global affairs into stable equilibrium.\nOLIVIA: You're serious.\nNINA: Yes, I am. Not to mention, I believe a position here would speed your effort to find answers.\nOLIVIA: You're referring to \u2018The Pattern\u2019?\nNINA: Among other things.\nBROYLES: Penrose took a hit. Forensics tracked a two-mile spatter trail leading from the warehouse out to route one. Local P.D.'s on the lookout, and I've ordered checkpoints along the Interstate, but nothing so far. He's still out there. (quietly) Listen... every aspect of these investigations is strictly classified. All of it. You understand that?\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nBROYLES: Certain private individuals have been granted clearance regarding \u2018The Pattern\u2019 \u2013 including Nina Sharp. But that clearance is limited.\nOLIVIA: I understand. Sure, but, uh... I'm not clear on what you're getting at.\nBROYLES: When you were with her, did she share anything with you? Did she mention the pattern? Did she comment or ask you anything about the details of your investigation?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, she did. She said you were a good man.\nBROYLES: And that was it?\nOLIVIA: She offered me a job.\nBROYLES: And what did you say to that?\nOLIVIA: I told her you were gonna give me a raise.\nPETER: (holding a document) \"I acknowledge that by signing this document, I waive my constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure.\" I'm not signing this!\nWALTER: I, however, will.\nPETER: Well, of course you will. What have you got to lose? You're already committed to a mental institution.\nOLIVIA: You have to sign it too.\nPETER: I'm not signing my rights away to the Federal Government. I already got enough trouble in my life. (tosses document back to her and departs area)\nWALTER: About my former colleague and his son. It's one of the inherent pitfalls of being a scientist - trying to maintain that distinction... between God's domain and our own. Sometimes, I forget myself. But then, you already know that.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nWALTER: If you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history. I've been meaning to ask you to--\nOLIVIA: Walter... there was no mention of any medical history. Just his birthday.\nWALTER: Oh. I was going to ask you to keep it between just the two of us, but, uh... I suppose, then, there's no need.\nWALTER: \u2026zero\u2026 one\u2026 one\u2026 two\u2026 three. \u2026eight\u2026 thirteen\u2026 twenty-one\u2026 thirty-four\u2026 fifty-five\u2026\nPETER: Hey Walter!\nWALTER: You're awake, Peter. Me too. I was trying to lull myself to sleep.\nPETER: Yeah, I'm... I'm aware of that. I can hear you. You think you could do that in your head?\nWALTER: Wasn't I? I thought I was. Sorry.\nPETER: That's okay. Just try and keep it down, alright?\nWALTER: 1... 2... 33... 3... 77... 2... 21. 6... 110.\nPETER: (gently) Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily\u2026\nWALTER: (concerned) Son? Is that you?\nPETER: Yes, Walter, it's me. \u2026stop talking and close your eyes, okay? Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily\u2026 life is but a dream\u2026\n(visual of three similar men at rest on gurneys)"

It's been three months since I've confessed.\nFATHER KENT: Go on, my son.\nROY MCCOMB: Do-- Do you believe that God can speak to you, father?\nFATHER KENT: Of course I do. The Lord speaks to all those who are willing to listen.\nROY MCCOMB: What about the devil, then?\nFATHER KENT: Do you want to confess something, my son?\nROY MCCOMB: I'm a good man, father. I - I try to be a good man. But I - I see things. (visual of a midtown commuter bus\u2026 suspicious man boards with a case) I s-- see things. I don't know why he chose me, but it's happening again. (more visuals of the commute) It's happening again, and I'm scared.\nFATHER KENT: Scared of what?\nROY MCCOMB: Of what's going to happen on the bus. (the suspicious man dons a mask and starts to prepare an attack) I want it to stop. Please. I just want it to stop.\nFATHER KENT: Son, have you hurt someone? (Roy flees \u2013 the attack on the bus is complete) Son! Son, come back. Roy! I know it's you. (finds a picture drawn of horrified commuters dropped by Roy)\nUNIFORMED COP: (approaching the motionless bus) Hey, let's go buddy, what's the problem? (sees the solidified passengers inside) Oh, my God.\n(dozens attended the graveside services of Agent John Scott)\nYOUNG PASTOR: The souls of the just are in the hand of God. And no torment shall touch them. They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead, and their passing away was thought an affliction. and their going forth from us, utter destruction - but they are in peace.\n(Amazing Grace sounds on bagpipe, a flag is draped on the coffin, John\u2019s mother stares, thunder sounds, Olivia reflects alone, then with Charlie)\nCHARLIE: (walking away from the ceremony) You know, you being here Libby\u2026 you did the right thing.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. The man betrays his country, turning over state secrets to God knows who. And here we are, pretending he's a hero.\nCHARLIE: I know. Stop. Bureau's got one black eye as it is. The last thing we need right now is another espionage scandal. You made it through. It's over now.\nOLIVIA: Did you see John's mother? She wouldn't stop looking at me.\nCHARLIE: His mother.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, like she was blaming me for what happened to him, like it was my fault he was dead.\nCHARLIE: As far as John's mother knows, her son died a hero serving his country.\nOLIVIA: A hero. He used me, Charlie. And he told me he loved me.\nCHARLIE: I wasn't gonna tell you this\u2026 but he said he loved me too.\n(both grin and chuckle)\nBROYLES: (approaching from behind) Agent Dunham. Agent Francis. (to Olivia) I need you to come with me.\nOLIVIA: (to Charlie) Thank you.\nPETER: You brought your own sweetener?\nWALTER: Don't be ridiculous. It's my medication.\nPETER: You're not on any medication, Walter.\nWALTER: Of course I am. I've been making it myself in the lab.\nPETER: Oh, I wish you were joking. You're self-medicating... with homemade drugs.\nWALTER: Simple combination of dextromethorphan, clonazepam, and some fluoxetine.\nPETER: Those are psychotics, Walter. All of them.\nWALTER: Of course they are. That's the point. I have been in a mental facility for the past seventeen years. It's put me quite out of balance.\nPETER: (leaving the stall) Stay here for a second, would you?\nWALTER: What if I need to use the bathroom?\nPETER: Just hold it. I'll be right back.\n(Walter notices the phone cell vibrating and takes the call. Peter intercepts a familiar face from his past with a camera. He grabs him and inspects the camera)\nCAMERA GUY: Hey! What're you doin'?\nPETER: What, you thought I didn't see you all day? (takes the digital memory disk from the camera)\nCAMERA GUY: You were supposed to check in before you came home.\nPETER: If you tell anybody else that I'm here, you're the first one of the bunch I'm gonna come after. (returns to the table)\nWALTER: It was moving but I stopped it. There was something important. Oh\u2026 I've decided on the pancakes. Blueberry.\nPETER: That's great, Walter. Did somebody call me on the phone?\nWALTER: Oh, that's what was important. Something about a bus.\nBROYLES: The incident occurred at 8:14 A.M. - middle of rush hour. First responders were worried it was bioterrorism. Ghosts of the Sarin subway incident in Tokyo in 1995. They called in the C.D.C. - confirmed the attack isn't biological in nature. There's no Contagion.\nPETER: And you said there wasn't any good news.\nBROYLES: (to nearby Officer) Excuse me. Team's coming in to transfer this bus to a secure area. I want you to extend the perimeter outside the tunnel another 50 yards.\nWALTER: It's horrible. They're like mosquitoes trapped in amber.\nOLIVIA: If this was some sort of attack, why not just use something conventional, like plastic explosives? A pipe bomb?\nPETER: Impact. Whoever did this wanted attention. I mean, look at that.\nBROYLES: Or it's not an attack at all. And it's something else entirely.\nOLIVIA: Meaning what?\nBROYLES: If I knew that, you wouldn't be here.\nWALTER: I imagine that the material was released in gaseous form before solidification. I need to study it back in my lab. Can I have some?\nOLIVIA: We'll have to dig out their personal effects so we can I.D. them. Notify their next of kin.\nMATTHEW ZIEGLER: It's not here.\nASSISTANT: In eius telephoni non fuit. Quomodo pergemus?\n(Roy sits at his desk with a pencil in his mouth, flashes visions, begins to draw)\nPAULA: Roy? (looks at his drawings) What is that?\nROY MCCOMB: (distraught) I don't know.\nPETER: Any idea what it is yet?\nWALTER: Tricky. Very tricky. (studies microscope slides) All I've been able to discern is that it starts as a silicon-based aerosol, and it solidifies somehow. You could be of assistance to me. I would love to hear some Bach. Mass in A minor. Will you play it for me? I'm sure the young lady down there would get us a piano.\nPETER: That young lady is an F.B.I. Agent - Walter. Her name is Astrid, and this is the 100th time you have forgotten her name. So, no. I don't think I can get you a piano.\nWALTER: You always resisted your lessons too. Lack of commitment, son, was always your problem. Imagine that's why you still haven't chosen a profession.\nPETER: I suppose I should've followed in your footsteps. 'cause your work has obviously brought such joy to the world.\nWALTER: Who was he, Peter?\nPETER: Sorry?\nWALTER: The man in the restaurant. You in some kind of trouble?\nPETER: It was nothing. He was harassing the waitress. I just told him to cut it out.\nWALTER: Oh, I see.\nOLIVIA: (to Forensics technician) Excuse me. Can you please extract this camera? (points) I want you to note all the people on this video. Cross-check them with the victims. (reviewing images) If we're lucky, maybe she caught whoever did - stop\u2026 go back. Can you close in on that woman? (sees Agent Mendoza)\nCHARLIE: What is it?\nOLIVIA: That backpack. I just saw that woman, that backpack wasn't there. Has anyone seen a blue backpack with the other personal effects?\nCHARLIE: So someone took the bag from her? Got off the bus before the attack?\nOLIVIA: Who is she? (technician calls-up computer personnel file) Evelina Mendoza. She's a federal employee. What's her job? (reads file) Oh, my God. She's D.E.A.\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) The woman who died on the bus, whose backpack was stolen, she was a drug enforcement agent. Undercover. She had a handler, Grant Davidson. I wanna bring him in for questioning.\n(visuals of Davidson in-processing in the lobby)\nGRANT DAVIDSON: I apologize if I wasn't helpful on the phone. I needed to ask my superiors for clearance to talk to you about Eve.\nBROYLES: Our condolences. From her records she seemed like an exemplary Agent.\nGRANT DAVIDSON: Ah, she was.\nOLIVIA: Can you tell us about the case she was working on?\nGRANT DAVIDSON: Uh, three months ago, she was tasked to infiltrate the east coast representatives of a Nicaraguan drug cartel. We'd been banging on them for over a year. She called me. Said she wanted me to pull her out. She was scared. Said she heard members of the cartel discussing something about \u2018The Pattern\u2019. I told her I never heard of it. And, uh, we set up a meet but she never showed.\nBROYLES: It appears whoever attacked the bus this morning was interested in one of her effects. Do you have any idea what she could've been carrying?\nGRANT DAVIDSON: I wish I could be more helpful.\nBROYLES: You have been, Agent Davidson. Thank you.\nGRANT DAVIDSON: Uh, I've been asked to officially I.D.\u2019d. her body. I suppose that won't be a problem.\n(in the morgue)\nOLIVIA: Have you spoken with her family?\nGRANT DAVIDSON: Uh, there's a brother she doesn't talk to. I didn't realize how hard this was gonna be.\nOLIVIA: You don't have to explain. I know what it's like to lose someone you've worked with closely.\nGRANT DAVIDSON: I'd uh\u2026 I'd like to say good-bye.\nOLIVIA: Of course.\n(he enters the exam room and takes her hand)\nOLIVIA: Should I bother to ask?\nASTRID: Music helps him process. It works too. As soon as Peter started playing, Walter just kinda locked in. He was able to recreate the material from the crime scene.\nPETER: Hey! (runs in)\nOLIVIA: I hear you play the piano.\nASTRID: He doesn't just play. He's good. You should hear him.\nPETER: No. Maybe some other time.\nWALTER: (seated at the piano) Olivia. You'll be pleased to hear we figured it out. The material, the gas that was released on the bus, turned solid when it met the nitrogen in the atmosphere - instantly immobilizing and suffocating the passengers.\nOLIVIA: So who would have the know-how to manufacture something like this?\nPETER: I'll give you six guesses. And the first five don't count.\nOLIVIA: Massive Dynamic.\n(a little later at the computer console)\nASTRID: (to Olivia) Three chemical companies in the U.S. supply those compounds\u2026 all of them fully-owned subsidiaries of Massive Dynamic.\nOLIVIA: (answering her cell phone) Charlie? What's up?\nCHARLIE: We've got something. I think you're gonna wanna see it.\nCHARLIE: (walking into the apartment) Tip got called in from a priest over at St. Anne's. Says the guy that lives here mentioned a potential incident about the bus before it happened.\nOLIVIA: So what do we know about him?\nCHARLIE: Name's Roy McComb. He\u2019s a high school graduate, no criminal record. Apparently he's been pushing papers over at an escrow company for the last couple of months. Got D.P.D. picking him up from there right now.\nOLIVIA: That doesn't seem like the profile of a mass-murderer.\nCHARLIE: No. I didn't think so either.\nOLIVIA: What? (follows Charlie into a room full of hand drawn atrocities)\nCHARLIE: You're looking at depictions of dozens of attacks, accidents, disasters we've seen over the past year. And look, all of them are dated before the incidents took place.\nOLIVIA: Is that the flight from Hamburg?\n(in the observation room)\nPETER: So this guy drew Flight 6-2-7, the \u2018Angel Suicides\u2019 in Baltimore and the \u2018Birmingham Bridge Collapse\u2019. Clearly, the man is disturbed\u2026 but do you really think that he could be involved in all this?\nBROYLES: No. I don't. But that doesn't make me any less interested in the way he got his information. Several of those incidents have never been made public. And based on the evidence, every one of them was either drawn or constructed before the event depicted.\n(in the interrogation room)\nCHARLIE: Mister McComb. I'm Special Agent Charlie Francis of the F.B.I. I want to tell you you're not officially being charged with anything right now. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is that okay?\nROY MCCOMB: Yeah, okay. Sure, hmm... call me Roy.\nCHARLIE: Okay, Roy. Let's start with this drawing of yours.\nOLIVIA: Fourteen different chemicals compounds were used in the material responsible for the incident on the bus. Three of them, manufactured exclusively by your subsidiaries.\nNINA: You've done your homework. We supply them to a dozen labs around the world. It could have been stolen from any one of them.\nOLIVIA: I'll need a list of those labs, then.\nNINA: Of course. Anything you need.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nNINA: So, is there anything else?\nOLIVIA: When we first met, you said that science and technology had advanced to such as state that - your words - they were running out of control.\nNINA: That sounds about right.\nOLIVIA: Well so far, all the science and technology that I've come across has been very tightly controlled by Massive Dynamic. Every case I investigate has a tie back to this company.\nNINA: Well, I think maybe you have it backwards. Massive Dynamic is... well, so massive that just about everything in the world of science and technology has a tie back to us. Of course, I could say something of the same to you, couldn't I? You've been investigating these cases for a very short while now. At least three of them have occurred right in your own backyard. I might suspect that you, yourself were somehow responsible. (accepts file from assistant) I hope it'll help you find whoever's behind these attacks.\nOLIVIA: Attacks?\nNINA: Apparently, Broyles hasn't told you. Yes, the technology was used once before in Prague, although there were fewer casualties. Then I suppose if you had access to the case files, you'd know that we'd already shared all the information we have with the Government. (hands file over)\nOLIVIA: Thank you. For the information. (departs)\nCHARLIE: What about this one? (holds-up drawing) This one's gonna happen too, Roy?\nROY MCCOMB: Look, I know that this sounds crazy, in fact, I think I am crazy. But I can be anywhere, at home or at work, and uh, then all of a sudden I get this, I don't know how to describe it... this... feeling and the only way that I can get it out, get rid of it is to try to draw what I see. Or to try to build it. Sometimes, that works.\nCHARLIE: How long have you been getting these feelings?\nROY MCCOMB: Maybe... nine months.\n(in a large briefing room)\nBROYLES: Nine months. Roy's... feelings, or whatever they are, began roughly when we became aware of \u2018The Pattern\u2019.\nPETER: Meaning what?\nBROYLES: I'm not entirely sure yet. But it's hard to say he's lying.\nPETER: He's not. I like to consider myself to be a fairly good poker player, which requires me to have the ability to read my opponents' tells, knowing he's bluffing. He's not bluffing. Regardless of what the actual explanation is, he sincerely believes that what he's saying is the truth.\nBROYLES: In that case, what do you suggest? How has he learned of these incidents?\nPETER: I don't know.\nOLIVIA: (walks in) Hey! I just saw Charlie who told me\nWALTER: (interrupts) Occam's razor. A lot of things being equal, the simplest solution's the best.\nBROYLES: And what is that?\nWALTER: The man's psychic. Theoretically, it's all quite possible.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying Roy can read people's minds?\nWALTER: I posit that Roy has no control over his abilities. That he's linked psychically with someone or less likely but still possible a small group of people responsible for these events. Equally possible, someone's who merely discussing them. Perhaps he's communicating with you Agent Broyles.\nBROYLES: Forgive me Doctor Bishop. I like to think I have an open mind. But I have a hard time accepting that that man is hearing another person's thoughts.\nWALTER: So do I. Which is why I would like to prove it.\nPETER: And here we go.\nBROYLES: And how would you do that?\nWALTER: Am I required to keep him alive?\nOLIVIA: That would probably be best.\n(outside on the breezeway)\nOLIVIA: Can we, uh... talk a moment?\nBROYLES: Go ahead.\nOLIVIA: Nina Sharp just told me that this isn't the first time that material from the bus has been used.\nBROYLES: I'd normally be skeptical of anything coming from Nina but in this case, she's correct.\nOLIVIA: So what? I don't even have clearance to know background on a case I'm investigating?\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham, if I'm not always completely transparent with you there's a reason: this little task force that you and I call our day job now. It sometimes requires some... shall we say bureaucratic maneuvering to keep it alive and free from political meddling\u2026 which means\u2026 sometimes I don't tell you everything for your own protection.\nOLIVIA: With all due respect, that's not good enough. I've been trained for a lot - hostage crises, terror campaigns, suicide bombers, chemicals attacks, but, you know the things I have seen since I started working for you... If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.\nBROYLES: And you will. When you're ready. Till then I suppose you'll need to trust me.\nPETER: So what are we looking for?\nWALTER: If my thesis is correct, if he is picking up the thoughts of another human being, he will leave a distinct signature.\nPETER: And you think we'll be able to identify whose thoughts they are?\nWALTER: That's preposterous. But I may be able to intercept them. (as McCombs enters the chamber) Magnificent machine! Do you mind if we view the axial images?\nCONTROL ROOM TECHNICIAN: His vitals are spiking.\n(McComb becomes very distressed)\nPETER: What's happening?\nWALTER: No idea. But I'm extremely interested to find out.\nROY MCCOMB: Something's wrong!\nPETER: Shut it down, now!\nROY MCCOMB: H, hu, huh\u2026 Help! (struggles clear)\nPETER: Get up. You okay?\nROY MCCOMB: I\u2026 I think so. What did that?\nWALTER: Something in the blood. A magnetic compound of some kind, dormant... perhaps a parasite.\nROY MCCOMB: What's he saying? I don't understand.\nPETER The machine is basically a gigantic magnet, and you've got metal in your blood. If we hadn't turned it off, it would've ripped your body apart.\nWALTER: It would have been quite a mess.\nASTRID: Why would there be metal in his blood? That's not normal, right? (everyone looks at one another with raised eyebrows)\nASTRID: (drags in boxes of files) You wanna see everything from 1989?\nWALTER: No. Perhaps '79.\nPETER: Fantastic. That's very helpful.\n(finds the file he was looking for)\nWALTER: Oh, stop. I was right. Belly and I worked on this very problem.\nASTRID: Belly?\nPETER: Yeah. As in William Bell - Founder of Massive Dynamic, and one of the richest men on the planet. He and Walter used to share a lab together.\nWALTER: Loved cloves. Awful odor. We posited a spectrum of waves lying outside of the range of those already discovered. We hypothesized that these waves could be used to communicate information. The Government, of course, was extremely interested. It was a brilliant idea. A theory, but a good one. They wanted to use the network to send their most clandestine information.\nPETER: Because if no other government knew the spectrum existed, they couldn't listen in.\nWALTER: Yes. And they called it the \u2018Ghost Network\u2019. But they asked us to take it one step further, to develop a method where they could transmit directly from one person to another. I surmised that I could introduce an iridium-based, organometallic compound into the subject's brain.\nPETER: You have got to be kidding me.\nWALTER: What?\nPETER: Roy McComb was one of your test subjects.\nWALTER: Of course. Yes! That explains it, doesn't it?\nPETER: Explains it? Yes, that explains why he almost died today. Because you injected something into his brain nearly 20 years ago.\nWALTER: No, what I gave him was not nearly enough to cause that reaction. The compound must have multiplied in his bloodstream over time. Environment, perhaps diet.\nPETER: He was a sophomore volunteer for psych experiments. Did you ever even bother to explain to him what you were doing?\nWALTER: Well it wouldn't have been a very secret experiment if I had.\nOLIVIA: (just arriving) What's going on? How's Roy McComb?\nPETER: Roy McComb will be fine. No thanks to my father's attempts to turn him into a human walkie-talkie.\nWALTER: Wait a second.\nPETER: Don't you try and change the subject!\nWALTER: What you just said is on subject. The iridium-based compound that multiplied in his bloodstream has turned him into some kind of receiver.\nPETER: A receiver of what?\nWALTER: Transmissions. Someone else, it seems, and I'm somewhat jealous of this, has perfected our \u2018Ghost Network\u2019. And is using it to communicate. Our dear Roy is merely overhearing what they say.\n(later on \u2013 a demonstration with a large kaleidoscopic image)\nWALTER: You will note that the rotary movement gives the impression of a three-dimensional tunnel, when in fact it is not. Next slide, please. (viewing an additional image) Ah, it's an oldie but a goodie. As you observe this image, your brain perceives first a duck, then a rabbit, then a duck again - it always comes back to the duck. In truth, the image is neither. But it illustrates the brain's need to take random sensory input and construct it into a meaningful whole\u2026\nPETER: (interrupts) Great!\nWALTER: \u2026 despite\u2026\nPETER: Thank you, we get it!\nOLIVIA: Uh, I'm sorry - I don't think I do get it.\nPETER: Well neither do I - I just want him to stop.\nASTRID: I'll get the lights.\nWALTER: I suspect someone has continued my research. But they've taken the easy way out\u2026. merely using the \u2018Ghost Network\u201d as a secure telecommunications channel.\nOLIVIA: You're suggesting that Roy's listening into someone's telephone network.\nWALTER: Yes. But no, not listening. Roy's brain is trying to interpret the sensory input. Much as our brains grapple with the duck - rabbit, I told you. It always comes back to the duck.\nOLIVIA: So if Roy's receiving this frequency, is there any way that we can tap in and hear them? Or maybe even I.D. them?\nWALTER: Construct a receiver using that spectrum, it's possible, of course. But it would take months. But it may be possible to redirect the transmissions from his visual centers to his auditory cortex.\nASTRID: Wait, you want to rewire his brain?\nWALTER: Not without his permission.\nPETER: It would be a minor surgery. Minor brain surgery. Emphasis not on the minor.\nWALTER: I would need a specific piece of equipment. Magnetic neurostimulator I built in 1983. With a few adjustments, it would work.\nPETER: Alright, we'll just go back in time and get it for you.\nWALTER: No need to. It's most likely where I left it 17 years ago. Hidden in a wall in our old house in Cambridge.\nPETER: Blast from the past. What's the game plan here? We just gonna knock on the door, ask 'em if we can tear out their walls?\nOLIVIA: Pretty much.\nPETER: I guess the badge is the \"pretty please\" in that equation. There's no lights on.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna call in, see if we can track down the owner for consent. (Peter tries to jimmy the door) What're you doing?\nPETER: What? This is barely even a crime. I used to live here. (the door swings open without effort)\nWALTER: Normal pupil response. Taking any medications, prescribed or illicit? You can be truthful. I won't judge. In fact, if the answer is no, I may encourage some drug use.\nROY MCCOMB: No, none.\nWALTER: Any food allergies?\nROY MCCOMB: Not that I'm aware of.\nWALTER: Good, good, good. This all checks out. Strap him down. We'll get started.\nROY MCCOMB: Oh, God. Strap me down?\nASTRID: There's nothing to be worried about.\nROY MCCOMB: I guess, uh - it must seem pretty silly... thinking God is talking to me and everything.\nASTRID: What were you supposed to think?\nROY MCCOMB: That I was just crazy. I considered that, too.\nASTRID: It's gotta be sort of a relief, right? Knowing there's a rational explanation?\nROY MCCOMB: I wouldn't exactly call any of this rational. Do you really think that this is going to help you catch the guys that killed those people on the bus?\nASTRID: You're our best lead. No pressure, huh?\nPETER: We lived here when I was a kid, but after Walt was institutionalized, my mom couldn't afford the mortgage so we moved down to an apartment in Allston.\nOLIVIA: So where's your mother now?\nPETER: That's a story for another time. So tell me. Of all the possible career choices, how did a girl like you end up in law enforcement?\nOLIVIA: Well, I pretty much knew this was what I wanted to do by the time I was nine.\nPETER: When I was nine years old, I think I wanted to be a brontosaurus. (finds an old hiding space) You know, they say the psych profiles of cops and criminals are pretty much identical. Ever consider a life of crime?\nOLIVIA: No dental.\nPETER: (empty-handed) Nothing. Of course.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: (finds an old sliding panel) My mom had this covered up. Used to hide in it all the time. (pulls up a dumb waiter)\nWALTER: You'll need to be awake for the procedure. - but I'm going to give you a mild sedative to reduce any anxiety.\nROY MCCOMB: Doctor Bishop, you look really familiar to me.\nWALTER: (administers sedative) I hear that a lot - in the mental institution where I lived. (to Astrid) He'll need a moment. (to Peter and Olivia coming through the door) Oh. You've returned. How was the old house? How is Rufus?\nPETER: Well, the house is just like we left, but we put Rufus to sleep almost 20 years ago Walter.\nWALTER: Oh. That's terrible news.\nOLIVIA: We found your equipment.\nWALTER: (inspects technical contraption) Oh, this brings back some memories.\nPETER: Of what?\n(preparing to operate)\nWALTER: I think it's time for some intracranial penetration. (lifts drill to McCombs head) This won't hurt\u2026 just feel a touch odd.\nROY MCCOMB: Okay.\n(a knock at laboratory interrupts. a freshman duo is lost. Olivia responds)\nFRESHMAN: Is this Poli-Sci 101?\nOLIVIA: (with disbelief) Not remotely.\nPETER: (Olivia returns) Who was it?\nOLIVIA: Freshmen.\nWALTER: (drills the skull) I need you to keep this dial steady at 60 hertz - 10 gauss until I tell you otherwise. I believe there are clusters of metal in the visual centers of your brain. I'm going to attempt to move them to those regions which process sound. You'll be shown a series of images. I need you to tell me any sensations you experience as you see each image.\nROY MCCOMB: Sounds easy enough.\nWALTER: First image, please.\nROY MCCOMB: It's a horse.\nWALTER: Wonderful. 50 gauss.\nROY MCCOMB: What the hell was that?\nWALTER: Oh, that was your body's normal muscle response. It's perfectly natural. You may also experience an involuntary bowel movement.\nROY MCCOMB: Great.\nWALTER: Next image, son.\nROY MCCOMB: Oh, man. Mmm, oh, this is bad. Oh, this is weird. Uh, I-- I'm-- mmm-- I'm tasting, uh, dirt. Uh, no wait, it's uh, gasoline.\nWALTER: We've reached the gustatory cortex. We're getting close. Next image, please.\nROY MCCOMB: I don't know. It's a beach.\nWALTER: Well, no sensations at all?\nROY MCCOMB: I don't think so.\nWALTER: Damn it, don't you feel anything?\nROY MCCOMB: Uh, I'm a little scared.\nWALTER: I don't understand. This should be working.\nPETER: Walter, take a deep breath. It's gonna be okay.\nROY MCCOMB: Nuntia adhuc...\nWALTER: You. (to Astrid) Increase the level to 200 gauss.\nROY MCCOMB: Ita, modo eum collocutus sum.\nPETER: Don't do that! Stop, I said!\nROY: Quando fiet.\nASTRID: What did you say?\nROY: I don't know. I can hear voices. Una hora locum statuisti.\nPETER: I think that's Latin.\nASTRID: It is. He just said, um-- damn, what's that word? Hora, um-- hour. Something's happening in an hour.\nPETER: How in the world can you possibly know that?\nASTRID: I majored in linguistics. My Latin's admittedly a bit fuzzy.\nOLIVIA: Okay, keep going.\nROY MCCOMB: Ad stationem.\nASTRID: Ad stationem, that means station.\nROY MCCOMB: Orstreelum--no wait, it's Australem ob.\nASTRID: Australem means south and then...\nROY MCCOMB: Commerciam convenimus.\nASTRID: An exchange is being made. um-- An exchange at south station. I think someone's meeting at south station to make an exchange in an hour.\nROY MCCOMB: Bene ubi fuit.\nASTRID: He just said, \"good, where was it.\"\nROY MCCOMB: Ab initio in eius corpore fuit.\nASTRID: From the beginning, on her person. It was on her person. It was on her from the start? Maybe or--\nOLIVIA: She had it on her the whole time.\nASTRID: Oh, yeah, that's a possible translation.\nPETER: Hey! Where you going?\n(Olivia races to the morgue to inspect Mendoza\u2019s hand. has flashes of Davidson visit)\nGRANT DAVIDSON: (in flashback) Now, I've been asked to officially I.D. her body. (Olivia finds that a large incision in Mendoza\u2019s hand)\nOLIVIA: (driving and talking on cell phone to Broyles) There was a three-inch incision in Evelina's right palm. Whatever she had on her, Davidson cut it out. She was hiding it in her hand. I'm heading to South Station now. I think he's planning a hand-off at five o\u2019clock.\nBROYLES: (on the run at Headquarters) We have to assume Davidson's working for the same people who hit the bus. I'll notify C.I. \u2013 but in the meantime, I'm sending the field assist your way.\nOLIVIA: But plainclothes only. We don't want to tip him off.\n(in the lab, McCombs remains engaged)\nWALTER: Oh, my god.\nROY MCCOMB: What's wrong?\nWALTER: I believe with proper demodulation, you could receive satellite television for free.\nPETER: Okay, fun time's over. Astrid, let's get him unhooked.\n(Grant Davidson, Olivia, Charlie, Matthew Ziegler, and Ghost Network at the commuter rail station\/Walter, Peter, Astrid and Roy McComb at Walter\u2019s Lab)\nGRANT DAVIDSON: (his phone rings at South Station) It's me, I'm at the station.\nGHOST NETWORK: (on phone ) Where am I meeting your man?\nASTRID: (in lab to McComb) Excuse me?\nROY MCCOMB: (to Astrid) I'm getting something. It's in English. We can see you.\nGHOST NETWORK: Outside South Station. We're verifying you haven't been followed.\nROY MCCOMB: Then we'll instruct you further.\nOLIVIA: (on phone) It's Olivia.\nPETER: (on phone) Hey, Roy's talking again. Are you at South Station?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Why?\nPETER: So are they.\nOLIVIA: Did you get anything else?\nPETER: They're checking to make sure that Davidson wasn't followed. I think that's it for now.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nROY MCCOMB: Could I get a drink or something?\nPETER: Yeah. I'll get you a glass of water.\nGRANT DAVIDSON: (answers phone) Go ahead.\nGHOST NETWORK: We're clear on our end. Go inside.\nPETER: (returns with water) Here you go.\nROY MCCOMB: (dictating) \u2026 and head to the Dewey Square exit.\nPETER: (to Astrid) You got that?\nGRANT DAVIDSON: (to Ghost Network) How will I recognize the person I'm meeting?\nROY MCCOMB: (dictating) \u2026 he\u2019ll recognize you.\nOLIVIA: (answer call from Peter) Yeah.\nPETER: It's happening now. He's headed to the Dewey Square exit.\nOLIVIA: Got it. (hangs up, calls Charlie)\nCHARLIE: (answers phone) Francis.\nOLIVIA: We got him. He's at the south end of the terminal.\n(she stalks the terminal and locates Davidson)\nOLIVIA: Turn around and put your hands in the air now.\n(he turns, she realizes he has been shot, he falls, killed by an assassin, his briefcase gone)\nCHARLIE: (catching up to her) Clear!\nOLIVIA: He's been shot. He's not breathing!\nCHARLIE: Call in a MedEvac!\nOLIVIA: The case. They've made the exchange. He's running.\nCHARLIE: Stay with him.\n(they chase Ziegler down the platform and corner him)\nCHARLIE: F.B.I.!\nOLIVIA: Put the case on the ground.\nCHARLIE: Drop the gun now!\nOLIVIA: Put your hands where I can see them.\n(the suspect deliberately steps backwards in front of a passing bus to avoid capture)\nOLIVIA: All that trouble for this. So any idea what it is?\nBROYLES: Not yet. But I'm hoping our friends at the N.S.A. will be able to tell us.\nOLIVIA: So eleven innocent people die today, we risk losing another by drilling through his head, all for something we know nothing about?\nBROYLES: Do you ever smile, Dunham? We I.D.'d the shooter. (pulls out file) Matthew Ziegler. When we ran his fingerprints, he popped up on two other pattern-related cases. We're digging into his financials, travel records. Linkage, Dunham. Not only can we now put a face to these people, but we know they're communicating. And how. I'd say that's an impressive day's work. Which brings me to this.\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nBROYLES: Of all the models in Roy's apartment, three of them are incidents that we haven't been aware of.\nOLIVIA: Pattern cases?\nBROYLES: It would seem so. Take a look. If you want. Let me know if you have any thoughts.\nOLIVIA: I'll do that.\nBROYLES: I'll see you tomorrow.\nOLIVIA: How are you feeling?\nROY MCCOMB: My head hurts a little, but, um, Dr. Bishop gave me something for the pain.\nWALTER: Vicodin. That's it. I promise.\nOLIVIA: So no more transmissions.\nROY MCCOMB: No.\nPETER: My guess is once you arrived at South Station with the cavalry, they realized the \u2018Ghost Network\u2019 was compromised, and stopped broadcasting on it.\nOLIVIA: Well just in case, if you hear anything else, do me a favor, give me a call.\nROY MCCOMB: I will. It felt really nice to be able to help. (to Walter) Thank you.\nWALTER: You're welcome.\nASTRID: I have a few release forms I need you to sign, and then I can take you home.\nROY MCCOMB: Okay.\nPETER: Dunham. Any requests?\nOLIVIA: How 'bout some Bach?\nPETER: Bach? No, that's way too stuffy. What you need is some jazz.\nOLIVIA: Well I'll take what I can get.\n(he plays)\nBROYLES: I'm sure you can understand why I don't wanna go through channels.\nNINA: If I know you at all, this isn't the only reason you're here. Is this because of our interest in Agent Dunham?\nBROYLES: Seems a bit early to be poaching my newest hire, with only a three-case resume under her belt.\nNINA: I didn't achieve my position without the ability to evaluate someone's talents immediately.\nBROYLES: Neither did I.\nNINA: Oh, you feel protective of her, don't you?\nBROYLES: I'm in the business of protecting all my agents.\nNINA: I want nothing but the best for her.\nBROYLES: Of course you do.\n(in a quiet lab)\nNINA: We found another one. (recovered chip)\nTECHNICIAN: Let's see what we have. (looking into a microscope) Well, crystalline structure's intact. No detectable oscillations. This may just be what we need to break the encryption.\nNINA: Speaking of which, I'm told you've made progress.\nTECHNICIAN: See for yourself. We finally stabilized the link. We've been pulling information from the disk for the last 72 hours.\nNINA: Let me know when it's finished.\n(John Scott rests in a chamber)"

Meat raw as possible. Room temperature water. No ice.\nWAITRESS: Gotcha.\nOBSERVER: Do you have jalape\u00f1os?\nWAITRESS: I think he does.\nOBSERVER: Eleven of those please. On the side.\nWAITRESS: Eleven? You got it.\n(he puts a journal on the table, observes the construction and takes notes)\nWAITRESS: (looking at the notes) What is that? That language, is that, like, Korean or something?\nOBSERVER: No.\nWAITRESS: Good. I had Asian studies at C.U.N.Y. I thought I really missed something.

Thirty milliliters at Eighty degrees...\nPETER: What formula are you rattling off at three o'clock in the morning?\nWALTER: The formula for root beer.\nPETER: Root beer. That's what's so important you couldn't stop yourself from broadcasting.\nWALTER: I haven't had it for ages. I\u2026 I thought I might make some in the lab tomorrow. Where are you going?\nPETER: It occurs to me it might be easier to sleep in the tub.\nWALTER: A root beer float. Delicious.\nPETER: Next time, would you please drain the tub?\nWALTER: Oh, yes. Indeed.\nPETER: I know how to get there.\nAGENT CHAPERONE: I need you to slow down.\nPETER: Her office is right up here. I've been there before.\nAGENT CHAPERONE: Sir, you don't have clearance to walk here unescorted.\nOLIVIA: (intercepting the two) Peter.\nPETER: We need to talk. (to Agent Chaperone) Is that okay with you? Do I have clearance to talk to her?\nOLIVIA: It's okay. I got it. Come with me. (walks to office) Where is your father?\nPETER: Walter is at the hotel. But don't worry, your agents are standing guard. Not that it matters, 'cause the man is unconscious. He was awake until five in the morning, reciting the chemical compositions of his favorite beverages to me. That was right after he finished lecturing me on how I'd squandered my above average intellect and my substantial education, all - while he was standing there naked. Because he prefers the breeze.\nOLIVIA: Well, your living arrangements are temporary. We're finding you an apartment so that--\nPETER: Olivia, don't bother. I wanted to help. I felt bad. I still feel bad about what happened to you. But the truth is, you don't need me here.\nOLIVIA: That isn't the truth.\nPETER: It is. Things are happening here. Strange things that need investigating, that connect somehow to the insane work that Walter was doing way back when, but he's the one with the answers. You need him. I'm just a babysitter.\nOLIVIA: Peter, you decipher what he says. Things that other people can't even follow.\nPETER: No, not any more. Anybody can do that. There's nothing special about me.\nOLIVIA: You're his son.\nPETER: That's not the only thing. I don't do well staying in one place. You know that. This isn't the job for me.\nOLIVIA: If you leave, so does he.\nPETER: Really? You're telling me that if the Federal government wants to get Walter Bishop out of a mental institution, they can't do that without the consent of his son?\nOLIVIA: It's your father. He's made it very clear that if you leave, he won't cooperate with our investigations.\nPETER: I don't believe it.\nOLIVIA: He would rather go back to St. Claire's - than work here without you. He said that more than once.\nPETER: (half seriously, half jokingly) Was he wearing clothes at the time?\n(the science team pulls-up to Kramer Manufacturing)\nAGENT: Good morning.\nWALTER: Hello.\nOLIVIA: Hello.\nGROUP: Morning\u2026 morning...\nBROYLES: Yesterday, there was an explosion at a construction site in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A crane collapsed. Left three dead, two dozen injured. The public was told that it was a gas main explosion, which, technically, is the truth. It's what caused the explosion I want you to see. (walking past a checkpoint) We had it transported here late last night. We've got N.S.A. and C.D.C. gathering data - but Doctor Bishop - I wanted you to see this as soon as possible.\nPETER: What is it?\nBROYLES: It's why you're here. We don't know.\nOLIVIA: It just fell from the sky?\nBROYLES: It came from underground. The thing blasted through an unused subway tunnel into a gas main.\nPETER: Underground?\nBROYLES: Came to rest right on the surface. As if someone had carefully placed it there.\nWALTER: (examines the beacon) Solid iridium?\nTECHNICIAN: We think so, yes.\nWALTER: Subsonic vibrations?\nTECHNICIAN: At two megahertz, and then again at four.\nPETER: This thing is vibrating?\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, do you have an idea what this may be?\nWALTER: An idea, yes.\nOLIVIA: Do you feel like sharing?\nWALTER: No. It's too early.\nBROYLES: This isn't the first time one of these has shown up... 1987 at Quantico, Colonel Jacobson was in charge of the investigation.\nOLIVIA: Henry Jacobson?\nBROYLES: Spoke to him myself this morning. He's expecting a visit. Said he's looking forward to seeing you again.\nOLIVIA: What do you wanna do?\nPETER: What kind of man would take off on you the minute a can of magic space soup - appears out of nowhere?\nWALTER: Who says it came from space?\nPETER: It's a joke, Walter.\nWALTER: Oh.\nOLIVIA: Thank you for staying.\nPETER: (whispers) This is the last one, Olivia. Then I'm gone.\nOLIVIA: (whispers) okay\u2026\nWALTER: We need to get this back to the lab.\nBROYLES: We can't risk transfering this to the university. We'd rather you stay...\nWALTER: ...if you require my perspicacity such as it exists - then there are certain fundamental requirements, not the least of which is access to my equipment! my lab...!\nHENRY JACOBSON: well\u2026 well\u2026 well.\nOLIVIA: I was hoping I'd have an excuse to see you again.\nHENRY JACOBSON: It's good to see you. Oh\u2026 (hugging)\n(inside his house)\nHENRY JACOBSON: It's been more than a year since she died. It's still difficult. I suppose it always will be. Jessica took care of the house. Hell, she took care of everything. I apologize for what has to be horrible coffee.\nOLIVIA: No, it's delicious.\nHENRY JACOBSON: I\u2026 I know you lost someone too. My condolences. It's not easy losing a partner. I know you and Agent Scott were close.\nOLIVIA: What can you tell me about Quantico? Nineteen-Eighty-Seven?\nHENRY JACOBSON: Master Sergeant Stuart Malick. He was at his post at the Marine base on the night of June Twenty-Second. His job was to watch the motion sensors, perimeter security, to ensure that there was no breach at the base. Except on that night, the sensors went nuts. What we found was this. Metallic cylinder, twenty-four inches tall, twelve inches in diameter. He assumed it fell from the sky. That perhaps it was a piece of a satellite. Except it wasn't. Stranger still, although it seemed to be a solid piece of hard metal, - it was vibrating.\nOLIVIA: At two megahertz. Then again at four.\nHENRY JACOBSON: There's another?\nOLIVIA: Where is this one? Still at Quantico?\nHENRY JACOBSON: I was called in to investigate. We determined it was transmitting something. A signal that we couldn't decode. Forty-eight hours after we found it, there was an explosion unlike anything I'd ever seen. It went through the floor to the basement below. It exploded down - and was gone. I'll give you my files, whatever you need. But this was a weird one, Olivia - and if it's happening again, as a friend, I'd ask you to stay as far away from this thing as you can.\nASTRID: And what exactly is this?\nWALTER: In time, my dear. (uses tuning fork)\n(John Mosley conceals an advanced looking assault pistol and barges his way into the restricted area)\nAGENT: Hello, sir, can I help you?\n(guards with rifles and body armor are hit with percussive fire)\nRADIO DISTRESS CALL: Code Red, Code Red! We have a breach in Sector Eight!.\n(shoots officers and breaks into the sealed area)\nJOHN MOSLEY: (to Technician) You. Where is it?\nOLIVIA: (her cell phone wakes her) Agent Dunham. - Hello? - Hello?\nJOHN: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Hello?\nJOHN: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: John?\n(she dials to have the call traced)\nDISPATCH: Dispatch.\nOLIVIA: This is Agent Dunham. Seven-Eighteen-Six-Twenty-Two-Seven-Nine. I need a call traced from my cell. It just came in.\nDISPATCH: Please hold. We have no record of any calls in the last three hours.\nOLIVIA: Oh.\nDISPATCH: I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you.\n(inspect and test the cylinder)\nWALTER: (inspects the Beacon) The precision with which this object was constructed is inspiring. Down to the molecular bonds.\nPETER: I sure hope that a gigantic metallic suppository is not the pinnacle of human achievement. What is it? Let me ask you a question. If I tried reverse psychology, like, if I just said to you right now, \"Walter, don't tell me what that is,\" Would that work?\nWALTER: Many years ago, I worked on 'Project Thor'. The Department of Defense wanted a subterranean torpedo, a missile which could, in theory, be shot from anywhere in the world through the earth's core and hit its target on the other side.\nPETER: I know for a fact that that is ridiculous.\nWALTER: Open your mind, son, or someone may open it for you.\nPETER: Even that doesn't make any sense.\nWALTER: The cylinder could be any number of things, none of which I am prepared to discuss.\nPETER: Great, well, I am glad I stuck around for this.\nOLIVIA: I don't believe it.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: Look. It's one of the photos from Jacobson's file. Him. Remember? The bald guy.\nPETER: No, who is he?\nOLIVIA: That's the point.\nPETER: Olivia, you're starting to sound like Walter.\nOLIVIA: There are many things I'm not good at, too many, but one thing I can do, that I've always been able to do, that game, Concentration. Memory. Connecting things. (brings up files) Putting them together. See.\nOLIVIA: Two weeks ago at the hospital. That's him. (points to the Observer)\nPETER: No way.\nHENRY JACOBSON: (answers door) Can I help you?\n(John Mosley blasts him across the room)\nOLIVIA: (displays evidence) Still photograph from the crime scene at Quantico, 1987. Look. He was there. Look at this. Less than two weeks ago at the hospital in Quincy. It's the same guy. And he looks the same. And he was there with us. What?\nBROYLES: Come with me.\n(she follows to a room with busy workers, and walls covered with photos)\nBROYLES: Excuse us please. It took us a year to spot him. You did it in three weeks.\nOLIVIA: (looks at photos) Who the hell is this guy?\nBROYLES: That is one excellent question.\nOLIVIA: You've run him through every database?\nBROYLES: Of course.\nOLIVIA: And there's nothing on him? Nothing at all?\nBROYLES: No positive I.D. We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes, all of which relate to 'the Pattern'.\nOLIVIA: How? And why? What is he doing?\nBROYLES: What it looks like he's doing. He's watching. Observing. Which is why we refer to him as \u2018The Observer\u2019. But what he wants and why he's there, we don't know.\nOLIVIA: And he was there the other day? In New York at the construction site?\nBROYLES: (answers cell phone) This is Broyles\u2026 (listens) When did it happen?\nWALTER: Okay, turn it on.\nPETER: What is that?\nWALTER: It's called sound.\nPETER: I know that, thank you. What's the point?\nWALTER: I need to compare the numbers, confirm my suspicions.\nPETER: Compare them to what? Suspicions of what?\nASTRID: (answers phone) Astrid Farnsworth.\nWALTER: I'll explain later.\nPETER: No, I want you to explain right now. I want to know what the hell this tin can is.\nASTRID: Peter? It's Olivia.\nPETER: Hello?\nOLIVIA: There's been an attack, Peter. The team at the warehouse is dead.\nPETER: What? Who did it?\nOLIVIA: I don't know, but we're moving that thing to a secure facility. I'm on my way.\nPETER: Got it. Walter, whatever the hell that thing is, you should have never brought it here.\nWALTER: Why do you say this? Has someone come for it?\nPETER: Why would you ask that?\nWALTER: Have they?\nPETER: Yes.\nWALTER: Then we need to keep this safe. We need something-- something very important.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: Aluminum foil.\nPETER: Why?\nWALTER: Trust me.\nPETER: No, thank you.\nWALTER: Damn it! Must you always be such a smart ass? I need the aluminum foil right now to shield the frequencies of the cylinder. Your life depends on it. All our lives depend on it. Go now!\nPETER: I'm gonna go get you your aluminum foil, and then when I get back, you're gonna tell me what the hell it is you think that thing does.\nWALTER: While you're out, if you see a chance to get me a root beer float, that would be wonderful.\nPETER: I'll see what I can do. (leaves the lab)\nWALTER: Would you be a lamb and get me that syringe?\nASTRID: Sure.\nWALTER: Thank you. (he grabs her and injects her. she collapses)\nPETER: Hey.. I got the tin foil! Astrid! Astrid! Are you okay? Astrid, look at me, Astrid. Hey, focus, focus for a second. Where is Walter?\n(Jacobson is tied-up and being interrogated)\nJOHN MOSLEY: Someone came to you. Think about her. I know you were there. The last time. And she's come to you now. Think about that woman. Don't play with me. Now - you tell me now, or I'll do that again. Think. (listens to his earphone) See? That was easy.\nWALTER: (to waitress) Bless you. (to The Observer) I haven't had a root beer float in seventeen years.\nOBSERVER: And? How is it?\nWALTER: Heavenly. And earthly at the same time.\nOBSERVER: Quite the connoisseur.\nWALTER: Do you want some?\nOBSERVER: No, thank you. I wouldn't taste much anyway. Seventeen years. That's a long time to go without something you love.\nWALTER: Where I've been, you lose track of time. So much now to make up for.\nOBSERVER: Thank you for hiding the beacon. I can't touch it myself. I know you have questions. Soon you will have answers.\nWALTER: Of course.\nAGENT: Doctor Walter Bishop, I'm forwarding his photo right now. I want surveillance posted outside his last known residence.\nPETER: Come on, this is getting annoying.\nBROYLES: Please do not stand there and tell me that you have no idea where your father\u2026\nPETER: \u2026you're assuming I have any understanding of how that man's addled brain works.\nBROYLES: You gave us the impression that you could handle him.\nPETER: Hey, let's get something straight. I didn't promise you anything. I warned you from the word \u2018go\u2019.\nOLIVIA: Agent Dunham. Thank god. Where? We'll be right there. Walter just got picked up, walking the median of I. Ninety-Five.\nWALTER: If it's possible, I would very much like my own clothes back.\nPETER: Let me explain how this works to you, Walter. You can't inject a federal officer with sedatives, steal government property, and then escape from protective custody, and then ask to be not treated like a criminal.\nWALTER: Have you never taken anything that didn't belong to you because you knew it was the right thing to do?\nPETER: This isn't about me.\nWALTER: Maybe it is, Peter.\nOLIVIA: You took the cylinder. Do you remember that?\nWALTER: Yes, of course. What would you like to know about it?\nOLIVIA: Where is it?\nWALTER: I can't tell you that. But I can tell you that someone is coming to seek the cylinder. Thus, I had to hide it. And I don't recall where or from whom.\nOLIVIA: We need you to remember. It may be dangerous, and we need to help keep people safe. Tell me what it is.\nWALTER: If I - if I attempted to explain it\u2026 You--you might think me mad.\nPETER: Don't worry. There's no chance of that happening.\nWALTER: I believe there are only another four hours in which I must keep the cylinder from those who are trying to get it, a theory I have discussed with my friend, who agrees with me.\nPETER: Your friend? Um, he's a tall fellow, right? Pink, big fuzzy ears.\nWALTER: No, he's a man. Quite nice. Albeit extremely bald. No eyebrows either. It's disturbing, but you get accustomed to it.\nOLIVIA: You talked to him?\nPETER: Do you really think it's a good idea to feed into his delusions at this point?\nOLIVIA: Walter, who is he? Where can we find him?\nWALTER: Oh, you won't be able to find him.\nPETER: Of course not, 'cause he's in the seventh dimension.\nWALTER: He's shy. Though he wouldn't be any use to you. He just observes.\nPETER: Walter, you haven't talked to this man. You've seen him in Olivia's photographs, so cut out the gibberish and just tell us where the cylinder is.\nWALTER: Must you always be so small-minded? Damn it, don't be like her. Like your mother. Questioning my judgment. I am not a child. I will not be babied.\nPETER: (leaving) Thank you for that. That's exactly what I needed. Guilt relieved. Olivia, I am very sorry, but I think you'll understand why I don't want to hang around any longer.\nWALTER: I upset him, didn't I?\n(Olivia leaves to find Broyles)\nBROYLES: Where are we?\nOLIVIA: I couldn't tell you. Walter's hiding something. He's being as cryptic as ever. He says he had to keep the cylinder safe. That someone is looking for it. Welcome to the joys of Walter Bishop.\nBROYLES: Where did he take it?\nOLIVIA: You'll have to ask Walter. He won't tell me. But, apparently, he had a meeting with a man matching the description of our friend. The bald guy.\nBROYLES: Well, I know a lot of bald guys.\nOLIVIA: The Observer.\nBROYLES: Are you saying Walter's saying he knows him?\nOLIVIA: I'm saying he's not cooperating. I'm saying I'm confused.\nPETER: (on cell phone) Hey, man. Thanks for calling me back so fast. (listens) Look, don't start with me right now, okay? (listens) Well, guess what, I'm calling this time to ask for a favor too. (listens) Nah, I need some work. (listens) Well, I don't really care, as long as it puts some money in my pocket. (listens) Anywhere but Boston. (listens) Okay.\n(John Mosley waits in a corner of the lab)\nAGENT RODRIGUEZ: Agent Dunham? Agent Farnsworth is on the phone.\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone) I don't know. About an hour ago? When he left, he was pretty upset with Walter. Maybe he just finally left.\nASTRID: No, there was a struggle here.\nOLIVIA: I'll check it out. Thanks, Astrid.\nOLIVIA: (to her Agent at desk) Call Harvard Campus Security. There's a closed-circuit camera outside Countway Library aimed at the Kresge Building. I need footage going back two hours.\nPETER: (strapped to table) You don't work for Big Eddie, do you? Look, I think you got the wrong guy. What I'm saying is... whatever it is you want, I don't think I'm gonna be able to give it to you. No, no!\nJOHN MOSLEY: (adjusts a strobe light) You have something I need. Tell me where it is.\nPETER: I have no idea what you're talking about.\nJOHN MOSLEY: I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer honestly. What's the most pain you've ever felt in your life? (presses a button)\nOLIVIA: This was taken outside of your lab. (shows photo of Mosley) Have you ever seen this man before?\nWALTER: I don't believe so, no. Something's happened, yes? Something unfortunate. What is it?\nOLIVIA: I believe this man may have abducted Peter.\nWALTER: That's not - no. Peter will lead him to it.\nOLIVIA: To what? The cylinder? How? Did you tell him where you put it?\nWALTER: No, of course not. I don't need to.\nJOHN MOSLEY: You and your colleagues had the cylinder last. Where is it now?\nPETER: I have no idea. And even if I did, you're the last person I'd tell.\nJOHN MOSLEY: But you just did tell me. Your father hid it. But you don't know where. And yes, to answer your question, when this is over, I just might kill you. It depends on a few things. When was the last time your father kissed you?\nPETER: I think that's your lamest question yet.\nJOHN MOSLEY: Yeah? (zaps Peter) Think about your father. Good. Good. Now think about a time before he was sent away to the institution. A happy time, a time when you still believed that your father loved you. Besides the car, and your old house\u2026 does your father have any other hiding places? Answer the question. Does your father have! Thank you. You just told me where the cylinder is.\nJOHN MOSLEY: (getting out of car) Come with me.\n(directs Peter to a specific area)\nJOHN MOSLEY: Shame you never met him. (about Robert Bishop) Come on. Dig. Careful.\n(Olivia searches for Peter and finds the two with the metallic cylinder. Mosley runs off)\nPETER: Hey, Olivia. Over here.\nOLIVIA: Are you okay?\nPETER: Yeah. \u2026that way. Go. He's got a gun.\n(Olivia finds Mosley and shoots him several times, he loses the cylinder and runs. she shoots and kills him. the cylinder disappears into the ground)\nOBSERVER: (watches and calls on his cell phone) Departure on schedule.\nPETER: (charging from the trees) Who the hell are you? What is the cylinder? You know what it is, don't you? (starting to have his thoughts read)\nOBSERVER: (mimics) You know what it is, don't you?\nPETER\/OBSERVER: (synchronized) Why is it here?\nPETER\/OBSERVER: Why now?\nPETER\/OBSERVER: Who are you?\nOBSERVER\/PETER: Apples, bananas, rhinoceros.\nOBSERVER\/PETER: I want to hold your hand.\nOBSERVER\/PETER: Lucy in the sky with diamonds.\nOBSERVER: (preempts) Do you really know my father?... Did you talk to him this afternoon? \u2026Are you his friend?\n(Peter stares. The Observer shoots him)\n(in the holding room)\nWALTER: Peter... Is he alright?\nCHARLIE: He's fine. He had a mild concussion, but he's gonna be fine.\nWALTER: Thank you\u2026 wonderful news.\nCHARLIE: Come on. I'm gonna take you back to your hotel.\nWALTER: If you don't mind, there's something I'd like to do first.\n(at Astrid's desk)\nWALTER: What I did to you was very untrustworthy of me. I never intended to harm you. I was simply doing what was necessary to protect us all. If it would help you feel a sense of retribution, I would tell you to inject me too. But... but I'd most likely enjoy it.\nOLIVIA: (to nurse) Hi, Peter Bishop, he was brought in about an hour ago. Excuse me. (to Broyles) Hi.\nBROYLES: Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I'm fine. So did we recover the cylinder?\nBROYLES: We dug out the hole, but there's no sign of it. As soon as the sun comes up, we'll bring in an excavator, but somehow, I don't have an expectation we'll find it.\nOLIVIA: So it just disappeared.\nBROYLES: We I.D.'d the shooter. John Mosley. Wanted for a double homicide in Seattle last month\u2026 a few drug-related felonies before that.\nOLIVIA: Seattle. Came a long way to try and get that thing.\nBROYLES: Another in a long line of questions. I should get back. As you can imagine, there are some interagency fires to quash. N.S.A. considered that device their personal property. They're looking for an explanation. So I'll see you tomorrow?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\n(Olivia finds Peter down the hall)\nOLIVIA: Hi. You ready to get out of here?\nPETER: Something happened out there tonight, Olivia. The pattern that Broyles refers to\u2026 I always thought it was nonsense. Inexplicable things happen every single day. It does not mean that there is any deeper significance. I know this is gonna sound insane. Yeah, I know that it sounds insane, but the man in the woods, he knew me. And I don't know how, but he was inside my head. He knew what I was going to say before I said it.\nOLIVIA: The man I shot?\nPETER: No, the other guy, the bald guy. From your photos. Mr. no brows?\nOLIVIA: Peter, I didn't see anyone.\nPETER: You know me well enough now to know that these are the last words I would ever expect to be saying, but what if Walter is right? What if this is just the beginning?\nOLIVIA: Listen, you took a pretty bad blow to the head.\nPETER: You think I did this to myself?\nOLIVIA: No, I just - I was wrong to-- to demand that you stay here. Walter is not your responsibility. As you've always said, this was just supposed to be temporary. You have your life.\nPETER: Olivia, did you hear what I just said? I mean, I'm a fairly open-minded guy, but there are things happening here that I can't even begin to explain. And I am not going anywhere until I can.\nOLIVIA: In that case, you might want this. Your credentials have been approved. Civilian consultant to the Department of Homeland Security.\nPETER: Does this mean I don't need an escort to come into the Federal Building anymore?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Will it get me out of speeding tickets?\nOLIVIA: Maybe.\nPETER: So let me tell you about my day, Walter. I was abducted, tortured, had two wires shoved up my nose that were connected to a machine I've never seen before. But maybe the strangest part of the day is that somehow, without talking, I was able to answer a question that I didn't have the answer to.\nWALTER: Where I buried the capsule?\nPETER: How did I know that, Walter? I didn't know that. I didn't know where the cylinder was buried.\nWALTER: You know it, son, because I know it.\nPETER: No, I didn't know because you didn't tell me.\nWALTER: I didn't have to. You must adjust the way you consider communications, ideas. Ideas can be absorbed through osmosis. Through proximity. Do you remember the night of the accident when you were young? - I was driving\u2026\nPETER: Of course, I remember.\nWALTER: Your mother was at home.\nPETER: Of course, I remember. Thanksgiving dinner.\nWALTER: She was anxious for us to get there, join everyone. When the car went off the road, the ice was so thick that it held the vehicle for what must have been two minutes.\nPETER: What does this have to do with what happened today?\nWALTER: I regained consciousness, I saw your body... contorted horribly, and I reached for you. But the ice broke. And we sank into that dark water.\nPETER: And then you swam to shore and saved us both. I know.\nWALTER: No. I was unable to control my limbs in that icy water. It wouldn't respond. I was incapable of saving you, or myself. We were dead, Peter, you and I. Until someone grabbed me. And we were going up. We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met. A man that shouldn't have been there at all. He pulled us to the shore. I remembered that he was bald, that he had no eyebrows. And as he set us down in the snow, I recalled his stare, standing there in his suit soaking wet, seemingly indifferent to the cold. It was as if he knew my thoughts before I did. As if he were inside my head. Without speaking, he made it clear that he would need me one day. A return favor, so to speak. And this is it. Today, what happened with the capsule, I'm not sure how I know about the vibrations, the composition. But then when I tested it myself, heard the vibrations, felt them, it was as if an envelope had been opened and I could finally read my instructions. Instantly, I knew that I had to protect the capsule for him. Who they are, what they want - as a man of science, I share your frustration in not having these answers. But what I know is that you are sitting here now... my son... alive. I know you must think me insane.\nPETER: Not nearly as much as you might think.\n(Olivia checks her mail and refrigerator, prepares a bowl of cereal, turns and sees John Scott)\nJOHN: Hello, Liv.\n(Olivia drops her cereal)"

Yeah, thank you. Okay, great. No problem Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Oh, I'm so... I did not mean to interrupt.\nBETHANY: No problem.

Oh\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Are you okay?\nBETHANY: Get away from me.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Oh no... Bethany? Bethany!\n(car alarms)\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Stop it! Stop it! Stop doing it!\nOLIVIA: I'm telling you because you knew about John and you didn't say anything, so I trust you. At least enough for me to not think you're gonna think I'm crazy.\nCHARLIE: Oh, of course not.\nOLIVIA: I saw him last night.\nCHARLIE: You saw John.\nOLIVIA: In my kitchen. Standing about as far from me as you.\nJOHN: Hello, Liv.\nOLIVIA: I grabbed my gun, But he was gone. I know he wasn't there. Obviously. I...I just...\nCHARLIE: Let me see. You fall in love with your partner... Who betrays you... And your country? He dies in your arms. Then he shows up in your kitchen And you're wondering if that's grounds To rescue yourself.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, okay, well, we can start with that.\nCHARLIE: I say no.You're the one that exposed him. Bare minimum, That makes you indispensable. You want my advice? Next time John shows up for a nightcap... Give him one.\nOLIVIA: I'm being serious.\nCHARLIE: So am I. You think a few weeks pass And everything you went through just goes away? Don't fight it. Don't beat yourself up. You know, You're good at that. That's a character flaw. It'll get easier.\nWALTER: Did she say what it was about?\nPETER: Olivia? No. She'll tell us when she gets here.\nWALTER: How are you feeling?\nPETER: Never been better.\nWALTER: Oh? You look quite the opposite.\nPETER: Maybe that's 'cause I had a little trouble sleeping last night.\nWALTER: Oh, I had trouble sleeping myself. I was thinking about that man. The one who tortured you. Something about him. So familiar. Peter, when I was in St. Claire's...\nPETER: We don't have to talk about this. It's not important.\nWALTER: But it is important. You cannot imagine what it's like for a man like me To not have access to parts of his mind.\nPETER: You're doing fine, Walter.\nBROYLES: Dr. Bishop, Peter.\nPETER: Ah, visiting hours. Everybody put on their best straight jacket.\nBROYLES: At approximately 10:17 A.M., a massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise in Worcester, Massachusetts. As a result, an elevator on the 26th floor plummeted straight to the basement. Eight passengers died.\nPETER: Did the cable snap?\nOLIVIA: That's what's strange. The elevator didn't fall. It drove itself into the ground.\nPETER: That's not possible.\nBROYLES: Nine months ago, a MagLev train in Tokyo plowed through a crowded station. Publicly, reported as human error. In reality, caused by a power surge of unknown origin. Intelligence chatter speculated that it might be a demonstration of a new weapon technology.\nOLIVIA: It's possible that this morning's event was another demonstration.\nWALTER: To override the elevator's circuitry would require a... a discharge of immense power and precision.\nBROYLES: I've made arrangements for you to be received at the building. We need to know what happened, how it happened, and who's behind it.\nPK SIMMONS: I'm PK Simmons, the building's engineer.\nOLIVIA: Olivia Dunham, FBI. This is my team, Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop.\nPK SIMMONS: So you've been briefed on what's happened?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nPK SIMMONS: Damn elevator powered itself into the floor. Never seen anything like it.\nPETER: Shouldn't the brakes have come on automatically?\nPK SIMMONS: Well, that's the thing. They did. I mean, the safety's clamped onto the rails alright, but for some reason, the motor just kept going. Nearly melted the shoes, which is technically...\nPETER: Impossible? Yeah, we're seeing a lot of that lately.\nPK SIMMONS: You know your elevators.\nPETER: MIT drop-out.\nOLIVIA: Is there any security camera footage?\nPK SIMMONS: Nope. All the cameras frizzed. Hey, can you people move out of there? FBI coming through.\nOLIVIA: So how could an elevator drive itself?\nPK SIMMONS: It's almost like another generator came online, Jacked into the system, and overloaded it with double or triple the voltage.\nWALTER: Exit wound burns. Subconjuctival hemorrhages. This woman displays all of the symptoms of a classic...\nPETER: Thermoelectric trauma.\nOLIVIA: What are you two saying?\nPETER: He's saying that all these people were electrocuted.\nOLIVIA: Electrocuted?\nWALTER: May I? That's lovely. 24 carat gold. Traces of nickel, possibly cobalt.\nOLIVIA: How are you doing that?\nWALTER: This entire space is charged with electromagnetic energy. far beyond that which occurs in nature. There's still residual magnetic energy from whatever electrocuted these people. I need to examine the victims' belongings, and one of the bodies as well.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying you may know how this happened?\nWALTER: No, not yet. But I can tell you every one of the passengers in this elevator was dead by the time they hit the ground.\nWALTER: I've worked on a project where I've seen this before. The government had asked me if it was possible to make a human being trackable by pigeons.\nPETER: Like homing pigeons? What possible use could that serve?\nWALTER: Well, I'm sure it had something to do with the commies. It always did back then. Regardless, our theory was that human beings are merely highly complex electrical systems. Um... battery, please, Olivia. The heart, the brain driven by electrical impulses. and because everyone has a unique electromagnetic signature, like a fingerprint, then we theorized that properly altered, pigeons should be able to hone into that signature.\nOLIVIA: Like the way they know how to fly south for the winter.\nWALTER: Precisely. But the human field was too weak, so we tried to augment it and make it strong enough for the birds to detect.\nOLIVIA: Did it work?\nWALTER: Oh, yes. But the side effects negated our plans. There was one test subject, every time she hiccupped, the lights would dim.\nPETER: So you're saying these people could control electronic devices?\nWALTER: No, not deliberately. But I did surmise that it should be possible. No, not deliberately.\n(heart starts beating by itself on the table)\nASTRID: Did you just make that thing come back to life?\nWALTER: No, not in this particular instance. But it does confirm my theory.\nOLIVIA: What theory?\nWALTER: Didn't I say?\nOLIVIA: No.\nWALTER: Someone has pursued this idea. They have amplified a person's electromagnetic field. And in fact, it is the residual energy from that person that is making this heart pump. And further, it is that person who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator.\nPETER: So you don't think it was a weapon that electrocuted those people?\nWALTER: No. It was a human being.\nDANIEL CHIN: (on the TV) ...accident occurred just after 10:00 a.m. here at the Herndon Building in downtown Worcester.\nCO-WORKER RICHARD: Hey, Ron wanted to see you.\nDANIEL CHIN: ...haven't yet been released, dropped 26 stories to their death when the building's elevator system failed catastrophically.\nCO-WORKER RICHARD: What's wrong with you?\nDANIEL CHIN: Investigators are now looking into possible answers as to why the emergency brakes...\nCO-WORKER RICHARD: You look sick.\nANCHORMAN: (on the TV) Thank you, Daniel. Now...\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Excuse me, Mr. Boynton.\nRON BOYNTON: Where have you been?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Excuse me?\nRON BOYNTON: Do you remember last week what I said to you? The words I used? How sympathetic I was? What did I... what did I say?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: That... that you... Yeah, that you were watching my performance.\nRON BOYNTON: I said you had to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule. because the system here, even when things are working, depends on people like you being, at the very least, reliable.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: I've... I've... had a really hard day.\nRON BOYNTON: Guess what? Your day is fantastic compared to mine.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No, it's not.\nRON BOYNTON: What the hell's on your uniform?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: What?\nRON BOYNTON: What is that?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: I don't... I don't know. And I'm... I'm not sure.\nRON BOYNTON: I'll tell you what. I'll make it easy. It's not your uniform anymore. Get your ass down to the locker room...\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Wait.\nRON BOYNTON: Take it off and leave it there.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No, but... but please. I take care of my mother.\nRON BOYNTON: Yeah, and I take care of my family. And one of the ways I do that is to employ smart, reliable, capable people. and you are none of those things.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Please.\nRON BOYNTON: You're fired. Go.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Mr. Bowing...\nRON BOYNTON: Get outta here, Meager. I don't want to see you in this building anymore. Get the hell outta here!\n(Boynton's arm gets caught in a machine)\nBROYLES: Here. (delivers coffee)\nOLIVIA: Thanks.\nBROYLES: I thought you left hours ago.\nOLIVIA: I could say the same about you.\nBROYLES: What are you reading? \"Neural distortion in human subjects.\" And what's all this for?\nOLIVIA: I'm just trying to wrap my head around an idea Walter had. He believes that it may be a person who was responsible for the Herndon incident. Not a person wielding some kind of device. A person who has somehow developed the ability to affect, or maybe even control, electrical devices.\nBROYLES: And I suppose the good doctor has a theory how that's possible.\nOLIVIA: He thinks this person was altered in some way. Extensive procedures. Chemical therapy. What?\nBROYLES: In the course of investigating other pattern cases, we've come across a handful of clinics. Off the grid operations that solicited clients by making the same kinds of claims you see advertised on TV at 3:00 a.m. Only they weren't actually providing weight loss or hair growth.\nOLIVIA: What were they really doing?\nBROYLES: Have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer?\nOLIVIA: No.\nBROYLES: Doctor of biotechnology. Wanted in four states and three countries for illegal human experimentation. Surgical alterations, radical hormone therapy, using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs. One subject was pumped full of stimulants and kept awake for a solid year. Fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images. I only bring it up because if Dr. Bishop is right, and there is a person with these extraordinary capabilities, it might very well be that someone made him this way.\nOLIVIA: I'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer.\nBROYLES: I'll have them transferred to your terminal. But it's not easy stuff to look at.\n(later - the power goes out and Olivia explore the corridors - hearing noises)\nOLIVIA: Hello?\nJOHN: Hey Liv It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. I know this doesn't make any sense to you. Even if it did, I know you don't have any reason to trust me. But that's what I'm asking you to do. We don't have much time. I'm here to help.\nOLIVIA: You tried to kill me.\nJOHN: No, Liv. I loved you. You know that. You know I loved you. I did. Always. I can prove it to you. But not here. It's... it's just not the way it works. You're on the right track. I'm here to tell you that. You're looking for a person, But Jacob Fischer is after him also. You need to get to him first, before Fischer can use him.\nOLIVIA: Use him for what? Use him for what? How do you know that?\nJOHN: I will prove it, Liv. That I love you. Always. But not just yet. You're just gonna have to wait.\nOLIVIA: There were weight sensors in the elevator. So just before impact, the car weighed 1,440 pounds. The combined weight of the victims, 1,275 pounds,\nPETER: Leaving a discrepancy of 165 pounds.\nOLIVIA: Meaning someone walked out of there alive.\nPETER: Okay. Somebody got lucky. So what?\nOLIVIA: Walter's theoretical test subject. I think he's real and that this could be him.\nPETER: The only problem with that scenario is that it doesn't make sense. If he was in the elevator car, he should've been electrocuted just like everybody else. And that's if the impact didn't kill him first.\nWALTER: Not necessarily. If this person is both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current, then it could well induce a form of electrodynamic levitation.\nPETER: That's the technology behind maglev trains. They essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion.\nOLIVIA: So he floated. Like my necklace in the elevator?\nPETER: Um, no, but... it is possible that he could've levitated long enough to escape the brunt of the impact.\nOLIVIA: That still doesn't make sense. If you can sabotage machines, you wouldn't sabotage one you're in.\nPETER: Unless it was unintentional An accident. Maybe whoever we're looking for isn't in control of their abilities. Maybe they don't even know what they're doing.\nOLIVIA: Then we shouldn't be looking for big events. We should be looking for small ones. Unintentional ones.\n[Walter touches Peter, causing a discharge of static electricity]\nPETER: Oh, come on! Damn it!\nWALTER: Just a small discharge. Negligible compared to the voltage coursing through that elevator. I say we need to find this person and soon. Before he finds out exactly what he's capable of. Wool socks.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, thanks for waking up the team.\nCHARLIE: Sure, look, we got reports of anomalies clustered around the outlying parts of Worcester and the Herndon building. Parking garage, gates, automatic doors, a few CCTVs.\nOLIVIA: Well, we need more. Enough to discern a pattern.\nCHARLIE: You know, saying somebody's doing all this. You do know that's crazy, right?\nOLIVIA: If it weren't, we wouldn't be looking for him.\nFLORA MEEGAR: Mmm, Joseph.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Mom.\nFLORA MEEGAR: What time is it? Where the hell have you been?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Mom. I think I made a big mistake.\nFLORA MEEGAR: You? Surprise.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No, pl... please just listen to me. Please. A few months ago, I was reading this magazine, and there was this ad in the back about tapping into your hidden potential, you know? and I... I figured it couldn't hurt. So I went down to this office. They did some tests.\nFLORA MEEGAR: Did you give them money?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No, just listen...\nFLORA MEEGAR: What the hell's the matter with you?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: They put me under some hypnosis. I don't know. And they... they said They were gonna, uh, realign the electrical impulses of my brain. Make it mimic a more confident person.\nFLORA MEEGAR: Oh...\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No, but they did something to me! They changed me. I can't remember. And now all these things have been happening. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. What do I... I'm dying...\nFLORA MEEGAR: Stop it! Get a hold of your...\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Damn it, mom! For once, please! Please help me.\nFLORA MEEGAR: Pills.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Oh, my god, Oh, my god. No, no, no, please.\nFLORA MEEGAR: Pills\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?\nJACOB FISHER: Joseph Meegar You don't have to be scared, Joseph. We want to help you. We're here to adjust your medication.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: You did this to me. What did you...\n(hypodermic syringe in Joseph's back)\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Ah!\nCHARLIE: We're looking for anything unusual. Systems going offline, random power surges.\nAGENT RODRIGUEZ: Hey, I've got another incident.\nCHARLIE: Hold on.\nAGENT RODRIGUEZ: BiCoastal Parcel. Guy lost his hand in a conveyor malfunction.\nCHARLIE: BiCoastal Parcel?\nAGENT RODRIGUEZ: Yeah.\nCHARLIE: I gotta call you back.\nOLIVIA: What?\nCHARLIE: Herndon Building security sign in sheet. BiCoastal Parcel. Joseph Meegar.\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone) She was found dead. A pacemaker malfunction.\nPETER: (to Astrid and Walter) Olivia thinks they may have found our guy.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, now we just have to find him. Time of death was around 1:15 a.m., So god knows where he could be by now.\nWALTER: Ask her what's visible in the event perimeter. Electronic, specifically.\nPETER: (on cell phone) Walter wants to know what's in the apartment. What kind of gadgets? Uh, specifically electronics.\nOLIVIA: Um, okay, there's an answering machine.\nPETER: Answering machine.\nOLIVIA: Telephone.\nPETER: Telephone.\nOLIVIA: Boom box.\nPETER: Boom box.\nOLIVIA: Fan.\nPETER: Fan.\nWALTER: B...boom box. That's a device for playing music. Cassette tapes, yes?\nPETER: Yes, but now's not really the time. (on cell phone) Anything else, Olivia?\nOLIVIA: Television.\nPETER: A television.\nOLIVIA: Lamps.\nPETER: A lamp. Walter! Walter! Pay attention, would you? We're doing this for you.\nWALTER: Tell Olivia to come home. I know how to find him.\nOLIVIA: So... so what is this?\nWALTER: This is the sort of work I was born for. has a unique magnetic fingerprint.\nPETER: You were hoping for something more specific, maybe?\nWALTER: Everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint. I said that, yes? But it is limited. Barely traceable, Except in people like Mr.... What's his name?\nOLIVIA: Meegar.\nWALTER: Meegar. But since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced, he'll give off stronger signal than your average joe.\nOLIVIA: So what's that got to do with the cassette tape?\nWALTER: The cassette tape is as simple as it gets. Once exposed to a magnetic field, it remains permanently magnetized. Given the strength of Mister... Meegar's electromagnetic signature, plus his proximity to the tape, I have little doubt that that cassette has been imprinted with Meegar's electrical signature.\nPETER: It... it's kind of like when a film camera double-exposes a picture.\nWALTER: Now we just take out the music and see what we have left. Uh-huh. Well... Wait, wait, wait... there it is. That's him. That's Mister...\nALL: Meegar.\nWALTER: Yes. Now to find Meegar.\nOLIVIA: How?\nWALTER: Birds.\nOLIVIA: Wait, you mean that pigeon thing?\nWALTER: Mm-hmm.\nOLIVIA: You believe we can find him using pigeons?\nWALTER: It's possible. As I've said, I can program carrier pigeons to track a strong electromagnetic field. We have his signature. Now all we need are birds.\nOLIVIA: I... I wish you told me earlier, because then I could've been working on it. So how many?\nWALTER: Not many. Two dozen.\nOLIVIA: Two dozen. Great.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Wait, where am I?\nMAN: (on phone) Tell Fischer he woke up.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: What is... what is this place? Hey, what are you doing? What are you... No, no, no! No, wait, no... Please! Please, please, please!\nPETER: You ready?\nWALTER: Yes, ideal.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you're not gonna accidentally fry one of those pigeons?\nWALTER: Stranger things have happened.\nPETER: That's his motto.\nWALTER: As I said, pigeons contain traces of magnetite in their beaks. Like hundreds of tiny compass needles. The tesla coils will create an artificial electromagnetic field, which I have already matched with Mister... Uh, whatever's unique signature, and will now imprint onto the pigeon.\nOLIVIA: So we set all of these birds free and they...\nPETER: Fly to Joseph Meegar. Yeah, I know. Me too. I'll believe it when I see it.\nWALTER: Step back! Work to be done. GPS chip's ready?\nASTRID: Yep.\nPETER: So we're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons to find a man who can control electricity? I have you to thank for that, don't I?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, that's me.\n(outside the lab in the hallways of Kresge Hall - Olivia sees John)\nOLIVIA: No!\nJOHN: You listened.\nOLIVIA: You're not real.\nJOHN: The last time we spoke, you listened.\nOLIVIA: You stay the hell away from me.\nJOHN: Liv, I didn't betray you. You know that. In your heart. You know I wasn't the one.\nPETER: Hey, I think this bird thing might actually work. You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Hey, Charlie.\nOLIVIA: Oh, thanks.\nPETER: Did I miss anything?\nOLIVIA: No, I think the show's about to start.\nWALTER: I know we've only been together for a short time, but I think I'm going to miss them. Such majestic creatures.\nASTRID: They're rats with wings. You'll get over it. Alright, GPS is active.\nWALTER: Excellent. Then we're ready.\nPETER: Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.\nCHARLIE: Start it up.\nWALTER: Come on, come on. (Walter whistles at birds. Birds leave. Walter laughs)\nASTRID: Are you sure this gonna work?\nWALTER: Of course not.\n(Peter and Olivia pursue in a car, Charlie follows)\nPETER: Seriously, if this works...\nOLIVIA: You're gonna have some more faith in your father?\nPETER: No.\nWALTER: So what do we do now?\nASTRID: We gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe.\nWALTER: Genius.\nASTRID: And we're in. And there are the birds.\nOLIVIA: I don't see them.\nPETER: (on cell phone to Astrid) Yeah, we lost the birds.\nASTRID: They're going northwest towards Mill street.\nPETER: We're approaching Mill now.\nASTRID: Uh, make a left.\nPETER: (to Olivia) Take a left.\nOLIVIA: I see them\nPETER: Alright, we got them. I see them. Aren't you glad you got the car washed?\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Ah! Ah! What is that?\nJACOB FISCHER: It is unfair. And I appreciate that the position you find yourself in now must be so surreal for you.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Oh, my God! What did you do to me? My head...hurts so much.\nJACOB FISCHER: Those had to be subdermal. They can be removed later.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: What am I doing here? No, no, no... Ah!\nJACOB FISCHER: You don't realize what you are.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: I'm scared. Okay?\nJACOB FISCHER: You wanted to be confident. That's why you came to us.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No, I don't want to be confident. I don't need to be confident.\nJACOB FISCHER: But you are now.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: I just want my life back! I just want to go back to how it was, please!\nJACOB FISCHER: Look what science has made you, Joseph. You are special.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: No.\nASTRID: Make a right on Tempest.\nPETER: Take your next right.\nASTRID: Alright I think they stopped\nOLIVIA: There.\nPETER: Alright, I got them. I see them. Okay, we're heading there now.\nASTRID: Then our work is done. Good luck.\nOLIVIA: Hey, you stay here.\nPETER: Whatever you say, boss.\nCHARLIE: I'm not gonna ask.\nOLIVIA: Good.\nJACOB FISCHER: What is it?\nCREWCUT: Visitors. Front entrance.\nJACOB FISCHER: Take him out through the back. Wait at the depot. You'll be contacted there.\nCREWCUT: What about you?\nJACOB FISCHER: He's the priority.\n(at the front entrance)\nOLIVIA: No movement.\nCHARLIE: Stand back.\n(in the garage)\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Where are you taking me?\nCREWCUT: Get in. Get in the car!\n(at the entrance)\nCHARLIE: Get those hands up. I said get your hands in the air.\nOLIVIA: Joseph Meegar. Where is he?\nJACOB FISCHER: I'm sorry. Who?\nOLIVIA: Take upstairs. We'll go around.\n(in the garage)\nOLIVIA: Freeze! Stop! Joseph! Stop or I will shoot!\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Ugh!\n(Meegar is wheeled to the ambulance)\nPETER: They're gonna keep him heavily sedated for a while - don't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing.\nOLIVIA: (approaching the ambulance) Mister Meegar.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: Miss, no one will tell me where I'm going.\nOLIVIA: To the hospital. They're going to perform some exams. Check to see that your head's okay. And then I'm gonna have some questions for you.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: I want to go home. I didn't want to hurt anybody.\nOLIVIA: We're going to help you.\nJOSEPH MEEGAR: That's what they said. Please... I want to go home.\nOLIVIA: I'm afraid we can't let you do that.\nWALTER: That one can go out the back. Thank you, my dear.\nASTRID: What's my name?\nWALTER: Starts with \"a\", yes?\nASTRID: Astrid.\nWALTER: ah, ha, ha - I knew it.\n(Olivia walks in)\nWALTER: Ah ha, Olivia. Peter told me to tell you, if I saw you, that he was returning the pigeons. (he starts to sip milk)\nOLIVIA: Walter. What's...\nWALTER: ah - that's milk\u2026 from Gene. Do you want some?\nOLIVIA: I'll pass.\nWALTER: Are you certain?\nOLIVIA: Um-huh.\nWALTER: The color in your face. You're looking a little pallid. Are you feeling well?\nOLIVIA: Fine. I'm a little tired - that's all.\nWALTER: Well, I don't yet know you well enough to ask this, but, uh... you haven't seemed yourself lately.\nOLIVIA: I haven't been sleeping very well. I've been... nothing. See you tomorrow.\nWALTER: Have you been seeing him? Your friend... John Scott. I'm not surprised. There is a reason.\nOLIVIA: I've been having hallucinations.\nWALTER: No. Not hallucinations.\nOLIVIA: Walter. What's happening?\nWALTER: I can't be sure. The brain is a mystery\u2026 but I believe, when you were in the tank, John Scott... that part of his consciousness crossed over into yours - and it's still there. His memories, experiences, thoughts. You understand me, yes?\nOLIVIA: These aren't memories. He appears right in front of me - he talks to me.\nWALTER: Yes, he would... like a waking dream... because he doesn't belong there. There's only room for one voice in your head, not two. This is your brain's way of working it out. Your mind is expelling him, exorcising his thoughts.\nOLIVIA: He'll go away... is that what you're saying?\nWALTER: I don't know. Do you really want him to?\n(Olivia sees imaginary John walking. She follows him to a basement full of files and photos)\n(Dunham joins her supervisor in his office)\nBROYLES: Our team is still cataloging all the files that we found in the cellar. Apparently John Scott was conducting his own investigations.\nOLIVIA: Did the files give any indication of who he might've been working for?\nBROYLES: Not that we can see. But it appears that many of the cases were Pattern-related.\nOLIVIA: He knew about 'The Pattern'?\nBROYLES: He also knew about our friend Dr. Fischer. In fact, he knew quite a bit more than we did. Including seven other potential Josephs that Fischer was subjecting to treatments. (she inspects files) Fortunately, none of them had activated yet. We were able to locate all seven. Medical services is examining them now, but they appear to be fine - thanks to you. Fischer's still refusing to cooperate, but I suspect six weeks in solitary (Dr. Fischer is locked in a cell) might change his mind.\nOLIVIA: Well, I hope you're right about that.\nBROYLES: And there was also something else. (puts a metal container on the table) - John Scott's personal effects. It would seem some of them were intended for you. (he departs)\n(Olivia opens a ring box with an inscribed ring reading 'Always')\nSCOTT: (voice-over) I will prove it Liv - that I love you - always."

You okay? Do you want some food? There's a wicked good vegetable soup. (gets a nod and walks back to the chef) Hey give me a soup.\nGARY: Onion?\nBEN: No. Vegetable. No one likes the onion. And call Marty would you?\nGARY: Marty? How come?\nBEN: There's some woman here who might be in trouble. She might need some help.\nBEN: (walks back to Emily) Here you go.\nEMILY KRAMER: Thank you.\nBEN: I used to love those crackers. When I was kid my mom would always get pissed at me because whenever we went out to eat I'd always eat like three packs before the food came and then I'd be stuffed.\nBEN: What happened there? Not that it's any of my business. I'll leave you alone if you like.\nEMILY KRAMER: I'm trying to remember.\nMARTY PITTS:I was at Thurber's.\nBEN: Hey Marty.\nMARTY PITTS: I'll just have a soda. How you doing tonight? You live around here? I do. I live in the area. Haven't seen you around.\nEMILY KRAMER: I know I was born in Boston.\nMARTY PITTS: Oh yeah? you were born there? So, uh, where do you live now? Where's home?\nEMILY KRAMER: I don't remember. They... they did things.\nMARTY PITTS: Who did things?\nEMILY KRAMER: I-- I don't-- I don't know. They-- they gave me a red medicine.\nMARTY PITTS: Yeah? So, uh, what was the red medicine?\nEMILY KRAMER: They didn't tell me.\nMARTY PITTS: Okay, that's alright.\nEMILY KRAMER: And, um, a blue one. There was blue. They -- they confused me. They... hurt me and --\nMARTY PITTS: Ma'am, I think you should come with me.\nEMILY KRAMER: No.\nMARTY PITTS: I can help you.\nEMILY KRAMER: No!\nMARTY PITTS: No no no, you're not in any trouble.\nEMILY KRAMER: No stop--stop it!\nMARTY PITTS: You need to talk to somebody. (trying to handcuff her)\nEMILY KRAMER: Stop it!\nMARTY PITTS: This is Officer Pitts. I've got a 5150. Can you make sure that Hannah's available tonight please.\nBEN: Aah! (becomes ill and collapses)\nMARTY PITTS: Ben. Ben! (everyone become violently ill)\nMARTY PITTS: I need an ambulance at the diner right away! Right now! (everyone starts bleeding from the eyes and ears) What the hell is this?!\n(everyone starts moaning and screaming, collapse then die. Emily's head explodes offscreen)\n(forensics and the science team gather outside. Walter hums like the nearby transformer)\nPETER: (to Olivia) What?\nOLIVIA: Oh, that doesn\u2019t bother you?\nPETER: Are you kidding? That man falls asleep counting PI to the one hundred first digit. That\u2019s soothing.\nOLIVIA: Walter!\nWALTER: Was I humming? I thought it was in my head.\nOLIVIA: It wasn\u2019t.\nWALTER: Forgive me Olivia\u2026 nothing sings like a Kilovolt. Unique pitch. Nothing else in nature quite like it.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\nPETER: What\u2019s up? What\u2019s on your mind?\nOLIVIA: Short fuse today, I guess.\nWALTER: Indeed, the tension in your voice indicates that you\u2019re carrying a heavy psychic burden. Tortured by the depths of some --\nPETER: Hey Walter, I think she liked it better when you were humming.\nBROYLES: The incident occurred approximately six hours ago. All we\u2019ve been able to determine so far is that they were exposed to high levels of radiation. Emily Kramer. Last night was the first night that anyone had seen her in two weeks \u2013 seem she was reported missing by her parents. Police officer inside responded to a psych disturbance, which would explain why we found her in handcuffs.\nOLIVIA: You think she was a runaway?\nBROYLES: Her parents say no. They say she was perfectly happy. In fact, she had just been accepted to a masters program she was excited about. Curiously, the level of radiation coming from Emily\u2019s body is almost three times as great as the rest.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying she is the source?\nBROYLES: Don\u2019t know. Doctor Bishop, any thoughts?\nWALTER: Yes\u2026 where can I get one of those white suits? (Regards the Hazmat suits worn by science team)\n(inside the diner)\nPETER: Oh... ah... oh, yeah\u2026 there\u2019s no head.\nWALTER: She was sick. Most like Bellini\u2019s Lymphocemia. (inspects Kramer\u2019s arms) striped bruising on her neck and upper arms.\nOLIVIA: You know what he\u2019s talking about?\nPETER: Bellini\u2019s Lymphocemia. It\u2019s an auto-immune disease. Irreversible. The body destroys its own muscles and organs.\nOLIVIA: Meaning it\u2019s fatal.\nPETER: Yeah.\nWALTER: Though I\u2019ve never seen Bellini\u2019s cause a victim to lose her head. And what\u2019s more curious - this woman seems to have been in remission. Cured even\u2026 the rash appears to be healing. Bruises receding.\nPETER: How do you cure a disease that is incurable?\nWALTER: I haven\u2019t the slightest idea, though I myself once cured this one in a dream. Opium. Fantastic stuff. Of course I forgot it as soon as I woke up. (he jams a meat thermometer into Pitt's brain through the ear)\nPETER: Uhh! Thanks for the warning.\nWALTER: One hundred twenty one degrees\u2026 that\u2019s counter-indicative for a hemorrhagic tumor. Most likely water molecules excited all at once.\nPETER: He means the guys brain was boiled.\nWALTER: Like a Maine lobster. I need this body and the headless one taken back to my lab.\nOLIVIA: Walter - her disease\u2026 If there\u2019s no cure --\nWALTER: Well, that\u2019s the question. And one which we should pose to whoever was treating her. Which makes three questions. The other one being, what exactly happened here?\nPETER: That\u2019s only two questions.\nWALTER: Oh\u2026 is it? Oh, the third question! Um, could I get some of this onion soup? It looks delicious.\nNADIM PATEL: Agent Dunham? Nadim Patel. Pleasure to meet you.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, thank you very much for taking the trouble to talk to me.\nNADIM PATEL: Of course. I\u2019ve been told you have news about Emily Kramer.\nOLIVIA: Unfortunately, I do. Emily was found dead last night.\nNADIM PATEL: What? How?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss that with you.\nNADIM PATEL: Forgive me. I\u2019m just\u2026 emotional investment in patients. It\u2019s an occupational hazard. Her poor parents must be devastated after everything they\u2019ve already been through.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, and I hate troubling you about this, but, we understand that Emily was suffering from a fatal disease that had recently gone into remission.\nNADIM PATEL: That\u2019s right.\nDUNHAM: (hesitates) Do you have any idea how that\u2019s possible?\nNADIM PATEL: Medically, no.\nOLIVIA: Were you treating her with any sort of radiation therapy?\nNADIM PATEL: Radiation? No, why?\nOLIVIA: The\u2026 the circumstances surrounding Emily\u2019s death were unusual. And it\u2019s possible that her condition may have been a factor.\nNADIM PATEL: I\u2019ll get you her records if that\u2019ll help.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nNADIM PATEL: She was finally starting to live again.\nPETER: Do I really need to be here? Couldn\u2019t you just use a clamp?\nWALTER: Of course I could, but I enjoy the company. Quality time, they say.\nPETER: Yeah, \u2018cause this is just like throwing around the old pigskin.\nASTRID: What\u2019s that smell?\nWALTER: Hyacinth, my third favorite flower. Associated in mythology with rebirth, which in this case is cruelly ironic.\nASTRID: It\u2019s coming from her?\nWALTER: Indeed, which indicates either a mutation at the genetic level, or she was eating flowers. Perhaps her perfume.\nOLIVIA: How\u2019s it coming?\nWALTER: Oh, Olivia, join us. We\u2019ve learned some things.\nPETER: We don\u2019t think she ran away.\nWALTER: Ligature marks.\nOLIVIA: So she was being held against her will.\nWALTER: Either that, or she had a proclivity for sexual bondage. Scientific observation, not a judgment. Some of my fondest memories --\nPETER: Oh Walter, stop! Wherever that\u2019s going is just wrong.\nWALTER: (points to body) There\u2019s also this. Subcutaneous injection marks. She was being given medicine intravenously.\nOLIVIA: So, whoever was holding her captive was giving her drugs.\nWALTER: Yes. But not the enjoyable kind. In fact, quite unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen before.\nPETER: (to Olivia) You okay?\nOLIVIA: Should I be? So, how\u2019d she end up in the diner?... Did she escape?\nWALTER: Perhaps not. There are two distinct methods in scientific experimentation. Lab trials or field trials.\nASTRID: You\u2019re suggesting they may have let her go on purpose?\nPETER: Whoever did this wanted to make sure what they did to her was working.\nOLIVIA: So there was something inside her that killed those people at the diner\u2026 in her.\nWALTER: Noggin? -- I am not sure yet. Just a theory, obviously I\u2019ll be more certain once we identify the substance\nOLIVIA: (answering phone) \u2026sorry\nWALTER: \u2026or when whoever did this\u2026\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone) Hey, Charlie.\nWALTER: \u2026tries to repeat their results.\nASTRID: You mean if they take another woman.\nWALTER: Judging by Agent Dunham\u2019s body language, I\u2019d say she is receiving that very news.\nOLIVIA: (to Charlie) Okay.\nCHARLIE: Missing persons called in another case four hours ago. Her name is Claire Williams. She was diagnosed with Bellini\u2019s Lymphocemia three years ago.\nOLIVIA: Someone\u2019s targeting people with the disease?\nCHARLIE: That\u2026 or it\u2019s one hell of a coincidence. Hey, Liv. I get it.\nOLIVIA: You get what?\nCHARLIE: Young woman, what was done to her. You know, this coming your way\u2026 today of all days.\nOLIVIA: (rings the doorbell) It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay.\nCHARLIE: Listen, I know you don\u2019t like to celebrate, but happy birthday.\nOLIVIA: (door is answered) Ken Williams? Olivia Dunham, Charlie Francis, FBI.\nKEN WILLIAMS: Claire\u2026 did you find her?\nCHARLIE: I am afraid we don\u2019t have any new information. But we do need to ask you a few questions.\n(inside the house a photo is shown)\nCHARLIE: Her name is Emily Kramer. She suffered from the same disease as you wife. You\u2019ve seen her before?\nKEN WILLIAMS: Another case? What -- what happened to her?\nOLIVIA: Do you know her, Mister Williams?\nKEN WILLIAMS: No, I -- I don\u2019t think so. We don\u2019t know anyone else with Bellini\u2019s\u2026 I mean, what we went through fighting Claire\u2019s disease\u2026 and the constant pain\u2026 when the lesions started appearing, she stopped going out. The damn disease almost took everything from us, even our marriage. And then\u2026 it was like a miracle.\nOLIVIA: A miracle?\nKEN WILLIAMS: She started getting better. The pain went away.\nOLIVIA: She went into remission?\nKEN WILLIAMS: About six weeks ago. She was herself again. And now\u2026 please find my wife. Please find her for me.\n(Claire's monitor beeps. her vision clears. she sobs)\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: What\u2019s happening?\n(Sarnoff adds a colorful drug to her treatment)\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: Please don\u2019t hurt me.\n(Sarnoff leaves the room. Esterbrook studies her on the monitor)\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: The last one was a test. This one counts. Is she a candidate?\nELIZABETH SARNOFF: Even better.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Let\u2019s get started then.\n(Claire begins to panic)\nWALTER: To understand what happened at the diner - we\u2019ll use Mister Papaya. Clear!... This is upsetting because he is the friendliest of fruits. (waiting)\u2026 and we have GOO-ification.\nASTRID: Is that the scientific term?\nWALTER: Wait. The show\u2019s not over yet. (the papaya explodes)\nOLIVIA: Is that what you think happened to the people of the diner?\nWALTER: That beam emits high energy microwaves which cause Mister Papaya\u2019s molecules to vibrate rapidly causing friction and producing heat.\nPETER: It\u2019s like how a microwave oven cooks food. Only in the Emily Kramer case\u2026 she was the oven.\nASTRID: But then what killed Emily?\nWALTER: This demonstration is far more effective with living tissue. I have some expendable gerbils in the back.\nOLIVIA: No.\nWALTER: Oh it\u2019s no trouble, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like it.\nPETER: Walter, just drop it.\nASTRID: Wait, am I missing something? How is it that Emily is, um, cooking people?\nWALTER: In her blood I found traces of radioactive isotopes, Strontium Ninety. I believe that these microscopic capsules are designed to release just the right amount of radiation at specific times \u2013 to cure her disease.\nOLIVIA: So you think these capsules saved her life.\nPETER: Think of it like time released chemotherapy.\nWALTER: Oh yes, yes but, in Emily\u2019s case, the cure are also made her a perfect candidate for weaponization. Whatever was injected into her bloodstream caused these capsules to burst all at once sending out a microwave blast and perhaps given her own head was the source of energy - kaboom.\nOLIVIA: So Emily\u2019s rheumatologist, Doctor Patel would he have access to these sorts of isotopes?\nPETER: It\u2019s doubtful - they only use them in a couple of therapies and they are really strictly regulated, why? You think Patel had something to do with this?\nOLIVIA: I don\u2019t know, but eighty three percent of kidnap victims are abducted by someone they know. I\u2019m gonna go and talk to Emily Kramer\u2019s parents.\nPETER: I\u2019ll come with you.\nWALTER: Oh Peter! If you\u2019re going out, could you bring me back some cotton candy?\nPETER: Cotton candy?\nWALTER: Yep\u2026 and Blue! Not pink. I\u2019ve had a craving. Must be the Hyacinths. Lovely blue flowers.\nPETER: You\u2019re probably way ahead of me on this already, but I\u2019m noticing certain uncomfortable similarities between this and some of the other incidents we\u2019ve been covering lately. More humans, being used as Guinea pigs. My point is, if this is part of the pattern, what if these people aren\u2019t just experiments? What if somebody is preparing for something? (notices a crowd arriving) Maybe we should come back later.\nOLIVIA: Before or after they do to Claire Williams, what they did to Emily Kramer?\nPETER: Olivia, this is a wake. These people are mourning their child.\n(they enter the house and heads directly upstairs)\nPETER: No. Don\u2019t you need a warrant for this? Hey Olivia - stop! Okay\u2026 crashing a wake is bad enough, but rifling through a dead girl\u2019s things?\nOLIVIA: It\u2019s the only hope we have of finding a solid lead, so please help me.\nPETER: What is it that we\u2019re looking for?\nOLIVIA: Anything, any connection she may have had - -\nPAULA KRAMER: (discovers them in the room) What are you doing in here? Who are you? What are you doing in my daughter\u2019s room?\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Kramer we\u2019re terribly sorry about your loss. We are with the FBI.\nPAULA KRAMER: FBI? Today? You come here today?\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Kramer. Please listen to me. Another girl\u2019s life is at stake.\nPAULA KRAMER: What do you mean? What other girl?\nOLIVIA: Her name is Claire Williams.\nPAULA KRAMER: Claire? What\u2019s happened to Claire?\nOLIVIA: You know her?\n(minutes later in Claire\u2019s room)\nPAULA KRAMER: A therapist told her to write through the pain and the alienation that she felt. It was all she had until the treatments.\nPETER: The treatments?\nPAULA KRAMER: For her Bellini\u2019s. Emily and Claire both had the disease. That\u2019s how they met. Here. They became such good friends.\n(they review a photo of Ken and Claire Williams with Emily Kramer)\nOLIVIA: (after banging loudly on the door) Why did you lie to me Mister Williams?\nKEN WILLIAMS: We met Emily at the hospital waiting for blood tests, she and Claire started talking, sharing horror stories about the disease. They became friends, and one night over dinner, the conversation turned to how the medical establishment had abandoned us. See, there\u2019s only three thousand people in this country who suffer from Bellini\u2019s. Not enough for the drug companies to make a profit. So they\u2019re not looking into developing a cure, and we started talking to some other people we met who also had the disease. A microbiologist, an investment banker, the mother of a professional athlete - started thinking about what we could do if we pooled our resources.\nOLIVIA: So Claire and Emily were treating themselves.\nKEN WILLIAMS: We didn\u2019t have a choice. We were desperate. We tried radical therapies normal doctors wouldn\u2019t touch. Three months ago we found a cure.\nPETER: Time released radioactive capsules.\nKEN WILLIAMS: \u2026yeah.\nOLIVIA: I don\u2019t understand. Why lie?\nKEN WILLIAMS: Because the people we love are depending on it. I can\u2019t take the chance you\u2019d stop that. Claire wouldn't want that. It is what gave us our lives back.\nOLIVIA: Mister Williams, we will need the names of the other patients involved.\nKEN WILLIAMS: I could give you some but I don\u2019t know all of them. You\u2019ll have to ask Doctor Nadim Patel.\nOLIVIA: Emily\u2019s doctor. He knew this was going on?\nKEN WILLIAMS: He cared enough to help us.\nPETER: The medication. Do you have a sample?\n(Williams nods)\n(Sarnoff prepares another dose for Claire Williams)\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: Is that my Bellini\u2019s medication\u2026 Just\u2026 Tell me what you\u2019re doing. Please just tell me what you\u2019re doing to me.\nELIZABETH SARNOFF: We know all about your disease Claire. We know that this makes you better. But this\u2026 this will make you special.\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: I\u2019m so tired. (sobs)\nNADIM PATEL: What is this?\nOLIVIA: When I told you there were unusual circumstances surrounding Emily\u2019s death, these were the circumstances.\nNADIM PATEL: I don\u2019t understand.\nOLIVIA: We know how it worked Doctor Patel. Ken Williams told us everything. What we don\u2019t know is who else was involved.\nNADIM PATEL: I\u2019m not responsible for this, not this. All I do is give them updates.\nOLIVIA: Who\u2019s they? Who\u2019s they?\nNADIM PATEL: Intrepus.\nOLIVIA: The drug company?\nNADIM PATEL: You should just walk away, you have no idea who you\u2019re dealing with, what they\u2019re capable of.\nOLIVIA: I need a name, Doctor Patel.\n(Patel turns to a file cabinet as if he were going to give find the name)\nOLIVIA: Doctor Patel? Doctor Patel?\n(Patel pulls a pistol from his files then turns and points it at Olivia)\nOLIVIA: (aims her pistol) Drop it!\nNADIM PATEL: I swear, it was only supposed to be updates.\nOLIVIA: Doctor Patel, put the gun on the ground now!\nNADIM PATEL: I\u2019m a doctor, a healer. Do you want a name?... David Esterbrook. (Patel turns the gun on himself)\nOLIVIA: NO!\n(gunshot off-camera)\nCHARLIE: Hey I found him\u2026 David Esterbrook - he heads up Intrepus Pharmaceutical Research Division. By all accounts, he\u2019s solely responsible for a 'gun\u2019s blazing congressional lobbying campaign' that allows Intrepus to dig into some of their more controversial R and D.\nOLIVIA: Define controversial.\nCHARLIE: Prenatal gene therapy, human\u2013animal hybridization studies, viral warfare, all the fun stuff. He is in Manhattan today, he\u2019s speaking at a humanitarian aid forum. Listen Liv, even if the doctor was right, even if Esterbrook had something to do with what happened to those women, I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb, I gonna say he\u2019s not going to confess.\nOLIVIA: I want to see it in his eyes, Charlie. I need to know it\u2019s him.\nOLIVIA: Mr. Esterbrook? Sorry to interrupt. Amanda Bennet, Baxil. Listen, with the risk of sounding sycophantic, I\u2019ve followed your work since Yale. Three degrees, including a PhD. in medicinal neurobiology. I couldn\u2019t even get through biochem without cheating off my roommate. (giggles) I\u2019m sorry, this will sound insanely na\u00efve to you.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: No, hardly.\nOLIVIA: Science and technology has reached a point where our means are finally catching up with our imaginations, and the only thing preventing us from doing truly visionary work are these moral-based restrictions that lawmakers put up in the name of public policy. That and money. We\u2019ll always need more money.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: I\u2019m gonna let you in on a little secret, Amanda. It isn\u2019t about the money. It is about the resolve.\nOLIVIA: I haven\u2019t been entirely honest with you. I don\u2019t work for Baxil. But I do know a colleague of yours. Doctor Nadim Patel.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: How is Nadim these days?\nOLIVIA: These days? Dead.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\nOLIVIA: Not as sorry as I was to watch it happen.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Identity theft is a Federal crime, Amanda.\nOLIVIA: So is kidnapping and murder. And it\u2019s Agent Dunham.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Tell me, what did you hope to get out of this conversation?\nOLIVIA: I already got it.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: How old are you? Twenty-eight? Twenty-nine? You\u2019re an attractive young woman. I\u2019m sure you want to start a family one day. It would be a shame if anything got in your way. (he walks away)\n(the elevator arrives and he exits)\nBROYLES: (answers his cell phone) Broyles. (exhales) When?\nBROYLES: Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nBROYLES: I understand you paid a little visit to David Esterbrook.\nOLIVIA: Well news travels fast, I was just about to type up the report - -\nBROYLES: In public\u2026 in a hotel bar.\nOLIVIA: I didn\u2019t realize my interview techniques were under such close scrutiny.\nBROYLES: Everything we do is under close scrutiny. This task force that you\u2019re now part of, at best\u2026 it\u2019s controversial. We need to be perfect. Trying to intimidate such a high-profile suspect in a murder investigation is reckless, at best.\nOLIVIA: Claire Williams is a prisoner right now, having god knows what injected into her body. And David Esterbrook knows where she is. He\u2019s guilty. And he just assumes he\u2019ll get away with it. So excuse me, but right now, I couldn\u2019t give a damn about politics.\nBROYLES: Which is exactly your problem, and now mine. You think you\u2019re the only one who wants to find Claire Williams? Meanwhile you violated the cardinal law of our profession. You let your feelings drive your decision-making. And as a result, you\u2019ve endangered not only Claire Williams\u2019 life, but everything we\u2019re trying to do here. If I can\u2019t trust you to control your own passion, Dunham, then I can\u2019t trust you... Is that clear?\nOLIVIA: You\u2019ll have my report on the Esterbrook interview within the hour.\nBROYLES: I\u2019ll be waiting.\nOLIVIA: Is there anything else you\u2019d like me to run past you?\nBROYLES: Not anything. Everything.\n(Claire\u2019s monitor beeps. Sarnoff releases a rat in the room)\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: How\u2019s it going?\nELIZABETH SARNOFF: She\u2019s almost ready.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: And the capsules in her blood stream, they can be triggered remotely?\nELIZABETH SARNOFF: Everything\u2019s as requested. She\u2019ll be stable and ready for transport by morning.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: I\u2019ll call the client and scheduled delivery. Well done.\n(Claire sees the rat crawl under her sheets. blood seeps thru)\nC.WILLIAMS: aah! oh! oh! What\u2019s happening to me?\nPETER: (knocks and enters) Hey, how\u2019s it going?\nOLIVIA: It\u2019s great. Esterbrook\u2019s our only lead to where they're holding Claire Williams, and I can\u2019t get to him. I mean, the guy\u2019s cleaner than snow. Not even as much as an unpaid parking ticket.\nPETER: Well, I think we actually might be making some progress. a couple of minutes ago, Walter thought he might have isolated the compound that\u2019s in Emily Kramer\u2019s blood, but then he got distracted by the unicorn running through the lab.\nOLIVIA: Funny.\u2026 Anything else? Got any more jokes?\nPETER: Alright, something\u2019s been bugging you all day. Something other than Claire Williams. And that\u2019s okay. You know what? We\u2019re all allowed to have our bad days. What\u2019s not fine is blaming it on me. I want to find her just as much as you do.\nOLIVIA: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Fine. I had a stepfather, and when he drank, he accused my mom of seeing other men, and then he\u2019d hit her. And she\u2019d just live with it. Never called the police, not once. Then one day, he beat her really bad and broke her nose. I was nine. He stormed out of the house, got in his car and drove off, my mom\u2019s crying and I can\u2019t help her, and then I hear his car. He\u2019s turned back around. He kept a gun in the drawer near his bed. When he opened the door, I pulled the trigger. Then I pulled it again. And I can still see his face - - almost daring me to finish. But I couldn\u2019t. So\u2026 they took him to the hospital and said that he couldn\u2019t be saved, but he didn\u2019t die. He recovered. Then one night, he just slipped away. We never saw him again. And I still blame myself, because I should\u2019ve done it if. I should\u2019ve killed him. And I know that rationally, he is not responsible for all the bad things in the world, but he is responsible for some of them. And every year he sends me a card on my birthday\u2026 Just to let me know\u2026 That he\u2019s still out there.\nPETER: It\u2019s your birthday today? (nods) No man is untouchable Olivia. If you really want Esterbrook, all you have to do is talk to your friend Nina Sharp. Massive Dynamic as three separate pharmaceutical divisions they\u2019re all in direct competition with Intrepus. Their annual budget for corporate espionage could feed a mid-sized nation. I guarantee you she has something on David Esterbrook.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, but even if you\u2019re right, I can\u2019t go to her.\nPETER: Why not?\nOLIVIA: Because despite their annual budget, corporate espionage is wildly illegal. You really think that she\u2019d admit that to me? It\u2019s here somewhere. I know it is. I just have to look harder.\nPETER: (walks out) I\u2019m going out.\nWALTER: Okay.\u2026 Oh, Peter! To be honest, I didn\u2019t even know you were here.\nNINA: (gives her horse to the trainer) Thank you.\nPETER: Excuse me. Miz Sharp. Hi, I\u2019m Peter - -\nNINA: Peter Bishop, Walter Bishop\u2019s son. You\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s done their homework. What can I do for you, Mister Bishop?\nPETER: Well, I was hoping I could take a moment of your time.\nNINA: Well\u2026 does Miz Dunham know you\u2019re here?\nPETER: No, no, she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here.\nNINA: Well, Peter, suppose we take a walk. (walking together) You\u2019re suggesting that Intrepus is conducting illegal drug trials with human beings. That is a rather bold claim to make, Mister Bishop. How are you able to substantiate your information?\nPETER: Would you put it past them? Let\u2019s assume for a second that what I\u2019m saying is true.\nNINA: hmm.\nPETER: Where would they do it? They wouldn\u2019t risk using one of their own testing facilities. It would have to be some place off the grid.\nNINA: You know, you still look just the same as you did when you were a child. Oh, I doubt you\u2019ll remember, but you and I spent a good deal of time together. Some of it right here. Your father and I were quite close when we were both much younger. Now I have all kinds of information, Peter, and some of it does me no good. Well, take the Aymara people, for instance, of Central Peru. I know that the soil beneath their land houses a naturally occurring metal alloy that is potentially hyper-conductive. I also know that you have managed to successfully conduct business with these and other tribal concerns, in parts of the world traditionally resistant to development.\nPETER: I\u2019m sorry, Miz Sharp. I think I must\u2019ve missed your question.\nNINA: My question is, are you willing to make a bargain? I\u2019d give you the exact location you want, and in exchange, I get to come to you someday, and you return the favor. No questions asked. So\u2026 Do we have a deal?\nWALTER: Do you smell that?\nASTRID: Yes, and next time how about a little warning?\nWALTER: Huh? Oh, not that. Methyleugenol. The chemical responsible for giving Hyacinths their aroma.\nASTRID: So what about it?\nWALTER: I have been trying to determine what caused that the radioactive capsules in Emily Kramer\u2019s bloodstream to burst at once. This is it, Asterisk.\nPETER: Astrid. Her name is Astrid.\nWALTER: I\u2019ve got it Peter. Methyleugenol is the key! That\u2019s what they injected her with. That\u2019s why these women were chosen. By itself, harmless, but given their treatments--\nPETER: Causing all the capsules to burst at once\u2026 They made her radioactive. They turned her into a weapon.\nWALTER: It will be a decidedly blue compound, and now that I know\u2014no\u2026 Yes\u2026 Yes! That\u2019s it. A bonding agent. That will work. That will interfere with the process.\nPETER: How long? How long will it take to make the cure?\nWALTER: Oh, not long at all. Now that I know. Where\u2019s Olivia?\n(meeting in the hallway)\nPETER: Ahem.\nOLIVIA: When did this happen? When did this become the world we live in? Patel, Esterbrook. These are the people we trust to take care of us.\nPETER: 5620 Stapleton Avenue. The facility where Clare Williams is being held. That\u2019s the address.\nOLIVIA: How could you possibly?--\nPETER: Radioactive isotopes have a heat signature that\u2019s visible to spy satellites. I had a friend track it down through the National Reconnaissance Office.\nOLIVIA: You have a friend at the N-R-O?\nPETER: I have a friend who\u2019s cracked their control systems.\nOLIVIA: Peter, if I pull the trigger on this and the information\u2019s bad\u2026\nPETER: It\u2019s good. It\u2019s good.\nOLIVIA: (dials cell phone) Charlie, I\u2019ve got a solid lead. (returns to lab) A strike team, full tactical.\nPETER: How we doing?\nWALTER: Almost there.\nOLIVIA: No, we\u2019re sure. This is the one. We\u2019ve got a visible heat signature from the isotopes.\nWALTER: Visible heat signature? Radioactive isotopes don\u2019t give off\u2026\nPETER: Walter, Walter, stay focused. How we doing?\nWALTER: Oh, uh, um, Olivia, this is the antidote. (shows syringe)\nOLIVIA: Okay, Charlie, we\u2019re coming now.\nWALTER: Listen to me. You must inject this directly into her bloodstream. In the jugular, preferably.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\n(in a room full od agents, photos and layouts)\nCHARLIE: Facility\u2019s located. On the southern edge of Framingham. Surveillance teams reported armed security on the premises. We\u2019re expecting resistance, so this will be the tactical entry.\nOLIVIA: Our main objective is securing the victim, Claire Williams. Judging from the layout, it\u2019s likely she\u2019s being held at the basement levels.\nOLIVIA: (in voiceover from the briefing) We\u2019ll enter through the northwest of the building. Alpha team will enter through the front, clear out the west of the building. Bravo team will clear the lower levels. Are we clear? Then let\u2019s make this happen.\n(tactical team forces entry into Easterbrook's lab and deploy)\nAGENTS: FBI, you\u2019re under arrest. Get down - now! Hands behind your head. Room is clear! I need one, I need one, I need one!\n(guard enters and shoots agent in the leg)\nAGENT: Look out! Man down!\nOLIVIA: (returns fire and hits the guard) We have a man down. We need immediate MedEvac. Call it in. Stay with him.\nCHARLIE: Level's secure. We\u2019ve got a few in custody.\nOLIVIA: Any sign of Claire?\nCHARLIE: No.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m going down.\nCHARLIE: Watch yourself.\n(locates Claire's room)\nOLIVIA: (to Sarnoff) Step away from that please. Where is she? Where\u2019s Claire Williams?\nAGENT: Agent Dunham, you can\u2019t go in that room. The radiation, it\u2019ll kill us all.\nOLIVIA: Claire! Claire! Claire, my name\u2019s Olivia Dunham, I\u2019m with the FBI. I know you\u2019re scared, but I need you to listen to me. I need you to come to the door. I can\u2019t come in there.\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: My head\u2026 It hurts.\nOLIVIA: Listen to me, that\u2019s medicine. I need you to come to the door and take it. I can\u2019t come in there.\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: AAH!\nOLIVIA: Claire! (Claire moans) Claire, look at me! That\u2019s good. Now come to the door. Keep coming. I need you to take the syringe. I\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. Good. Claire.\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: unhh (begins to convulse)\nOLIVIA: Claire! Look at me, Claire! I\u2019m right here with you. Claire! Claire, right now you need to jab yourself in the side of your neck.\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: Oh my god. My head.\nOLIVIA: Claire! Claire! Come on\u2026 Claire, do it! You can do this. Just do it. I know you can do it. Stab it in.\nCLAIRE WILLIAMS: (she injects the syringe) aah! unh!\nOLIVIA: Claire! Claire!\n(Olivia barges into the room that Esterbrook is working in)\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Agent Dunham. Apparently I didn\u2019t make my point clearly enough.\nOLIVIA: I thought you\u2019d be interested to know that Claire Williams is safe.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Can\u2019t say I\u2019m familiar with that name.\nOLIVIA: That\u2019s odd. Because an employee of yours, Elizabeth Sarnoff, just admitted that you supplied her with the facility and the equipment to make Emily Kramer and Ms. Williams into human weapons.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: A disgruntled former employee will say just about anything to vilify the boss that fired her.\nOLIVIA: Then you won\u2019t mind coming with me to answer some questions.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Do you honestly see this going anywhere, Agent Dunham? I have a law firm on retainer that charges more by the hour than you make in an entire year.\nOLIVIA: Then I suggest you get them to meet you at the FBI.\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: I\u2019d guess I will include police harassment in the litany of charges that I will file against you.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m still gonna walk you out that door in handcuffs for resisting questioning. So the press that I tipped off\u2026 can splash your picture all over the news. You may not answer or the Federal government, but you do answer to a board of directors, and I wonder what their response will be when they have their company dragged into the middle of a murder investigation. (slams him face down on he table)\nDAVID ESTERBROOK: Ohhw!\nOLIVIA: (checks her mail, then checks-in with her supervisor) I guessed by now you\u2019ve heard.\nBROYLES: That you frog-marched a senior officer of a multibillion dollar conglomerate out of his office? Yeah, I heard. Quite a few cameras there.\nOLIVIA: (smiles) The press they always get their pound of flesh. I understand that you think I acted too emotionally. And putting aside the fact that men always say that about women they work with, I\u2019ll get straight to the point. I am emotional. I do bring it into my work. It\u2019s what motivates me. It helps me to get into the headspace of our victims\u2026 See what they\u2019ve seen. Even if I don\u2019t want to, even if it horrifies me. And I think it makes me a better agent. If you have a problem with that, sorry. You can fire me. But I hope you don\u2019t. (turns to leave)\nBROYLES: You\u2019re not getting off that easy Agent Dunham. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\n(in Nina\u2019s chauffeured vehicle)\nCAR RADIO: \u2026today as the spike in the price of oil again sent tremors through the financial markets, but for pure shock value nothing beats today\u2019s very public detainment of Intrepus\u2019 David Esterbrook by the FBI. Intrepus\u2019 stock is being absolutely pummeled in overnight trading, and analysts predict it will open\u2026\n(in Olivia's vehicle)\nCAR RADIO: \u2026 (report continues)\u2026 At twenty three dollars a share. That\u2019s a ten year low, which of course is very good news for Intrepus\u2019 competitors, most notably Massive Dynamic. Shares of MD are up almost twelve percent as investors flee to the most reliable brand in the sector.\nWALTER: Olivia!\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nWALTER: Did you lock yourself out again?\nPETER: Actually Walter, this is our hotel.\nWALTER: Oh.\nOLIVIA: I need to talk to you.\nPETER: Sure. (to his Walter) I\u2019ll see you upstairs, okay?\nWALTER: It\u2019s nice to see you.\nOLIVIA: Good night, Walter.\nPETER: And remember tonight, please, the red toothbrush is mine.\nWALTER: White for Walter, that\u2019s me. Right?\nPETER: (to Walter) Yes. (to Olivia) Everything okay?\nOLIVIA: I know where you got your information. About Claire Williams. What was her price? What did Nina Sharp want in return?\nPETER: Nothing untoward, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\nOLIVIA: Peter.\nPETER: You don\u2019t have to worry about me. I am a big boy. I can take care of myself. You have been looking out for me, so I\u2019m just returning the favor.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: There was no letter today, was there?\nOLIVIA: No.\nPETER: Happy birthday.\nOLIVIA: You better get back upstairs before Walter falls asleep in your bed. Ahem.\nPETER: Yeah. He has actually done that before. While I was sleeping. Really not something you want to wake up to. Good night.\n(on the floor inside the door is an unsigned card that says - 'thinking of you')"

What's your E.T.A.?\nRADIO-A: We're in position. Standing by. No activity, Captain.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Roger. Hold position. - Charlie?\nRADIO-C: In position. Standing by.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Delta?\nRADIO-D: Standing by, Captain.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Roger. Cutting engines. At South Bank now.\nMITCHELL LOEB: South Bank quiet. Bravo, status?\nRADIO-B: All quiet, sir. Wait. I think I hear something. We have Tango in sight.\nMITCHELL LOEB: All teams, move out. Go, go, go.\nSWAT TEAMS: - Stop the truck! - Stay where you are! - Out! Out! Get out! - Hands where I can see them!\nBROYLES: Panda bears? I assume you checked inside them.\nMITCHELL LOEB: They knew we were coming. Somewhere, they made a switch. Joseph Smith. Began working for the shipping company a week before the container was packed. He had access to the container. He's also got a science background. Customs has him back and forth from Budapest eight times in the past 12 months.\nBROYLES: Other local agents on the operation?\nMITCHELL LOEB: Coscarelli and Scrimm. Page 47.\nBROYLES: Weight of the container after pickup was 1306 pounds. The weight when it arrived in Germany before shipping, 1299. That's seven pounds. What the hell weighs seven pounds?\n(Loeb collapses.)\nBROYLES: Mitchell? Let's get a medic in here!\nDOCTOR #1: What'd you give him?\nNURSE #1: One round of eppy. Intermittent cardiac arrest. I've never seen anything like this.\nNURSE #1: Pupils fixed one minute, dilating the next.\nDOCTOR #1: How's the rhythm now?\nNURSE #1: Asystole.\nDOCTOR #1: Charge the paddles. We'll start at 200.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Phillip! What's happening?\nBROYLES: We don't know.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Is he gonna be okay? Is it a heart attack?\nBROYLES: The only thing for us to do is wait.\nDOCTOR #1: Clear! All right,again. Let's go to 300.\nNURSE #1: V.fib.\nDOCTOR #1: Clear! We gotta open him up, pump the heart manually. Prep him. Scalpel... Saw. Retractor.\nNURSE #1: We got something - his heart's beating.\nNURSE #2: What is that?\nDOCTOR #1: I don't know.\nBROYLES: In happened in my office two hours ago. It wasn't a heart attack. At least not in the traditional sense. They cordoned off the area. But ID's been here already. - said the thing isn't communicable.\nOLIVIA: The thing?\nBROYLES: We'll get to that.\nWALTER: You have any gum?\nPETER: No, Walter.\nWALTER: Mints?\nPETER: No. Later.\nBROYLES: Agent Loeb returned from an operation last week in Frankfurt. Do you know him at all?\nOLIVIA: No.\nBROYLES: He collapsed. Thought it was a seizure at first, except he appeared lucid, in pain. Didn't seem like a heart attack either. None of us knew what it was. And none of us know now either.\nOLIVIA: How are his vital signs?\nBROYLES: Weakening. Doctor Bishop. What you're about to see... I don't know if you've seen anything like it before. But I'm hoping you have. I'm hoping you can help. The man lying in that room is not just a colleague, he's a friend.\nWALTER: I see. Do you have any mints? (in the operating room) This is spectacular.\nPETER: \"Spectacular.\" I'm sure he'd be thrilled to hear your diagnosis.\nOLIVIA: Do you know what that is? Your work or your old experiments, does that look... look familiar?\nWALTER: No. Couldn't be more aberrational. I'm simply admiring the design. At least partially organic. Looks like the hybrid result of genetic manipulation. Symmetrical, its central body mass. If indeed it is an organism at all, It's designed, it seems, to envelope the entire human heart. Look, look. A series of tendrils. A root system. Don't you see it? How beautiful this is?\nPETER: Not so much. No.\nOLIVIA: Can you help? Do you think you can remove it?\nWALTER: Oh, I'd be willing to try. But not here. My breath is atrocious.\nWALTER: I was deconstructing in my head the approach to designing something like this. And... and two things occurred to me in the hospital. One, we could be dealing with something as simple As, uh, Giardia Duodenalis.\nOLIVIA: As simple as that. Really?\nPETER: It's a single-celled parasite that lives in the intestines of animals. Common waterborne illness.\nWALTER: Could we attach Mr...\nPETER: - Loeb.\nWALTER: Loeb... to the vitals machine, please?\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that... that thing in his chest...\nWALTER: Is a parasite? Yes. Yes, perhaps. But with an exceptional means of attachment. Typically, parasites use whole body insertion. This creature is unlike anything I've ever seen before. So we won't be able to truly examine it Until it's removed.\nASTRID: Mitchell Loeb's recent case files, as requested.\nOLIVIA: Oh, thanks, Astrid.\nASTRID: And his wife just arrived. She asked to speak with you.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna talk to her in the office.\nPETER: Okay, he's wired. What was the other thing?\nWALTER: Pardon?\nPETER: You said that two things occurred to you. What's the other one?\nWALTER: Oh. I would still really like some gum. Or some mints? Thank you, Peter.\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Loeb. Olivia Dunham. I'm with Homeland Security.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Samantha. I'm hoping you can help me. No one will tell me anything. Why was he transferred here? Can you at least tell me that?\nOLIVIA: I can tell you that there's a doctor here who is... uniquely qualified to save your husband's life.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: This was in his bag. Among the things he brought home from Frankfurt.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: I don't know if it'll help at all.\nOLIVIA: It might. We'll check it out. Thank you.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Can I see Mitchell? Please.\nOLIVIA: As soon as possible. I promise you that.\nWALTER: - Uh-oh...\nASTRID: What's happening?\nWALTER: It's killing him. Squeezing his heart. Killing him.\nASTRID: What are you doing?\nPETER: I'm gonna give him some cyclobenzaprine. If the parasite is constricting, this might loosen its grip.\nWALTER: It's a gamble, but I like the theory. Look at this. This is good. Organism's tissue.\nPETER: Where the hell are you going?\nWALTER: D.N.A. analysis should tell us much.\nWALTER: Excellent work, son. You may have found your true calling at last. Working with me.\nPETER: I certainly hope not.\nOLIVIA: Please tell me you guys have some good news.\nPETER: I don't know if it's good news, but it is something.\nWALTER: This is fascinating.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: We can assume that this growth, this parasite, is... is of human design, yes?\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWALTER: I was looking for repetition. The signature of the creator. A sign, a... a footprint that he or she had been there before us.\nOLIVIA: I don't understand.\nPETER: Well, that puts you in the same group as the rest of humanity. What he's trying to say is we found this.\nWALTER: Ah. No, see that? This pattern repeats throughout the DNA sequence. It appears again and again. But it's too organized to be accidental. Too perfect to be natural.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that someone put in this line of DNA on purpose. Why?\nWALTER: Mischief. Arrogance. We don't know. Your friend thinks it might be a code.\nPETER: The other one.\nASTRID: I studied cryptology even before I joined the bureau. I was obsessed as a kid. Now, I keep assuming it can't be this. That it's too simple to be plain text. But I think it may just be the 'Caesar Shift'.\nPETER: What's that?\nOLIVIA: It's a simple mono-alphabetic cipher.\nPETER: Is it now?\nOLIVIA: It's what Julius Caesar used, apparently, to send letters to his friends. You take one letter and replace it with another, but in alphabetical order.\nASTRID: There's a sequence of three letters that appears repeatedly in the parasite's DNA. It could be CIY or DJX. Or EKY.\nOLIVIA: Or ZFT?\nASTRID: Yeah, ZFT fits. What is that?\nOLIVIA: I've been reviewing John Scott's cases, checking to see if any of them were mishandled, or seeing if any of the cases were left unsolved.\nBROYLES: And?\nOLIVIA: And one of them that I remember was an operation tracking a group working out of Budapest. The name on the file, what was written, was \"ZFT\". That mean something to you? What?\nBROYLES: A month ago, a man... British national named David Robert Jones, was arrested in Frankfurt, Germany, by InterPol on possessi\u00f3n of state secrets. His background is in deep bio-technology. Notably genetic weaponry. He was a senior fellow at the Bremming Institute for twelve years, then went off the grid. He'd show up now and then, often in Eastern Europe.\nOLIVIA: So you think he is Z.F.T.?\nBROYLES: I don\u2019t know. But Loeb did. It was one of the reasons he was in Frankfurt\u2026 investigating Jones.\nOLIVIA: Meaning that thing\u2026\nBROYLES: May be retribution.\nOLIVIA: So Z.F.T., What is it? Who are they?\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham, there is much you have not been made aware of regarding \u2018the Pattern\u2019.\nOLIVIA: Well \u2013 I\u2019m here. I have time. Are you available?\nBROYLES: What we\u2019ve learned so far is the following: There are cells \u2013 we don\u2019t know how many. Privately funded with presence in eighty-three recorded countries. Z.F.T. is among them.\nOLIVIA: So they\u2019re terrorists.\nBROYLES: Not in the conventional sense. They traffic not in drugs or weapons, but in scientific progress.\nOLIVIA: Meaning what?\nBROYLES: Meaning what happened on Flight Six-Two-Seven, or what happened to Agent Loeb. These may have been simply proof that a scientific theory, an experiment \u2013 worked.\nOLIVIA: So that thing we found in Loeb \u2013 could be one of those experiments. Do you think Jones will tell us how to remove it?\nBROYLES: He might, if we were allowed to see him. German authorities have refused us access.\nOLIVIA: What?\nBROYLES: There not giving the U.S. access.\nOLIVIA: And he\u2019s being kept in Frankfurt?\nBROYLES: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: I may be able to get in.\nBROYLES: You got super-powers you aren\u2019t telling me about?\nOLIVIA: Maybe.\nBROYLES: You\u2019re not really going to Germany?\nOLIVIA: Yeah \u2013 I\u2019m really going.\nBROYLES: Let me save you the trip, Dunham. You\u2019re not getting in.\nOLIVIA: We don\u2019t know each other well enough for you to say something like that to me. And I don\u2019t see any other option here. Do you? Sir. Loeb\u2019s your friend. And I promised his wife.\nPETER: What\u2019s wrong?\nWALTER: This may be something of an understatement, but he is not doing well. Dehydrated.\nPETER: Walter, come here. (points to the intravenous drip) What is that?\nWALTER: That\u2019s the root.\nPETER: Coming up from his arm?\nWALTER: Into the I.V., yes. This parasite is spreading faster than I thought.\nPETER: How long do you think he\u2019s got?\nWALTER: A day\u2026 maybe.\nPETER: (cell phone rings) Hey.\nOLIVIA: (driving quickly) Hi\u2026 so the good news is I think we have a lead. The bad news is I have to go to Germany to see him.\nPETER: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the bad news \u2013 he\u2019s dying Olivia \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna make it.\nOLIVIA: We\u2019re gonna make it. I\u2019ll call you when I land.\nOLIVIA: Look at you.\nLUCAS: Well, don\u2019t let the suit throw you.\nOLIVIA: Wow, Lucas, I never thought I\u2019d see the day.\nLUCAS: It\u2019s more comfortable than the military uniform.\nOLIVIA: yeah\u2026 hi\u2026 (nervous kiss on the cheek)\nLUCAS: I\u2019m not sure I can help you.\nOLIVIA: You said you have contacts at the prison.\nLUCAS: I\u2019m in the Bundestag. I have contacts everywhere. But you jumped on the plane so fast, I didn\u2019t have time to check anything out.\nOLIVIA: Well, what did you find?\nLUCAS: I know the warden. He wouldn\u2019t agree to anything. He didn\u2019t want me to show up.\nOLIVIA: So what do we do?\nLUCAS: Show up.\nWARDEN JOHAN LENNOX: Tenacious as always. What can I do for you, Lucas?\nLUCAS: Olivia Dunham, this is Johan Lennox.\nOLIVIA: Thank you for seeing us.\nWARDEN LENNOX: You want time with a prisoner?\nOLIVIA: David Robert Jones.\nWARDEN LENNOX: This will be a problem.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m sure we can work something out.\nWARDEN LENNOX: I\u2019m sorry.\nLUCAS: Es gibt da bestimmt Dinge, die Sie gebrauchen k\u00f6nnen und ich w\u00e4re bereit, \u00fcber diese Dinge zu reden. [There are bound to be things, that could be of some use for you and I am willing to talk about these things.]\nWARDEN LENNOX: Mit dem, was ich brauche, k\u00f6nnen Sie mir nicht helfen. [You can't help me with what I need.]\nWARDEN LENNOX: (to Dunham) Your friend wants to be persuasive.\nOLIVIA: Mister Lennox, you have your reasons why you won\u2019t allow access to your prisoners, but this is very important to me. I would be willing to sign anything. Etwas, das beispielsweise beweist, dass ich nicht hier war [For example something that proves I was never here.]\nWARDEN LENNOX: I like her.\nLUCAS: You have good taste.\nWARDEN LENNOX: Even if I were to give the okay, Mister Jones talks to no one.\nOLIVIA: Well I have reason to believe he will talk to me\u2026 if I write him a message, will you give it to him?\nBROYLES: I don\u2019t expect miracles\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I expect anything. But I am grateful - for whatever you can do in this case.\nWALTER: (oblivious) Sorry?\nBROYLES: I was just saying I\u2019m grateful for your work.\nWALTER: You\u2019re most welcome... You know I had a fruit cocktail once. In Atlantic City. Mind you, I\u2019m not a fruit cocktail sort of guy.\nBROYLES: Excuse me. We need to discuss your father.\nPETER: Is it the fruit cocktail thing again?\nBROYLES: Um-huh.\nPETER: Yeah, he\u2019s been doing that recently. He gets obsessed about certain foods. It\u2019s weird.\nBROYLES: We need him to focus.\nPETER: To focus? Mister Broyles\u2026 two-thirds of the time, my father\u2019s not even lucid. And in those rare and unpredictable moments of clarity, he rambles on about the foods and beverages that he missed while he was incarcerated in a mental institution for the better part of the last two decades. To say that he\u2019s not focused\u2026 Is to say that he\u2019s a bi-ped \u2013 which is to say, you\u2019re absolutely right. He\u2019s not focused. And also, it\u2019s not going to change anytime too soon. I\u2019m his son \u2013 I\u2019m not a puppeteer. I\u2019d don\u2019t have a remote control. There\u2019s no master switch I can flick and turn him into the man I wish had raised me, or even somebody I don\u2019t have to baby-sit ever day.\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve had that on my mind for awhile.\nBROYLES: Apparently.\nBROYLES: (cell phone rings) Broyles\u2026\nCHARLIE: It\u2019s Charlie Francis. I understand I\u2019m not at clearance level, but I have something for you.\nBROYLES: What is it?\nCHARLIE: Local connection to the Z.F.T.\nBROYLES: Speak to me.\nCHARLIE: We analyzed the document Loeb brought back from Frankfurt. We figured out each line corresponds to an FBI case file \u2013 and an I. D. number for the Agent or Agents assigned to it. Every one of originating from this field office.\nBROYLES: Another mole in this office? And you think what? John Scott? He was working with Z. F. T.?\nCHARLIE: Maybe, maybe not. Whoever did this needed upper level security clearance. Access to the FBI mainframe.\nBROYLES: You said local connection?\nCHARLIE: Yeah, one of the lines is a phone number registered to a Joseph Smith \u2013 and we have him tied - -\nBROYLES: Yeah, I know Joseph Smith. Loeb was briefing me on him when he collapsed! You got an address?\nCHARLIE: Hold on\u2026 Four-Three-Three-One Broad Street, Saugus.\nBROYLES: Four-Three-Three-One Broad Street. I\u2019ll call you back.\nBROYLES: I want a SWAT team surrounding Joseph Smith. He\u2019s at forty-three thirty-one Broad Street, in Saugus. And I want this radio silent.\nLUCAS: It\u2019s good to see you again, despite the strange circumstance.\nOLIVIA: You don\u2019t have to wait with me.\nLUCAS: As you keep telling me. I want to. I like it here.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nWARDEN LENNOX: I\u2019m surprised. He\u2019ll see you\u2026 but not until tomorrow morning. This is not Jones\u2019s rule, or mine. It is the institution\u2019s. Long before I got here, there have been strict regulations regarding visitors. Tomorrow morning, you\u2019ll have fourteen minute, not a second more. (Dunham nods) Mister Jones wanted you to have this. (he hands Dunham a note)\nPETER: (cell phone) Hello.\nOLIVIA: Peter, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m looking for Broyles. Is he there?\nPETER: No, he\u2019s on some sort of raid.\nOLIVIA: Jones has agreed to meet with me tomorrow morning. But only on the condition that he first get to talk to a colleague of his. So we\u2019re looking for a guy local to Boston. He\u2019s in Saugus.\nPETER: He\u2019s in what?\nOLIVIA: (looks at the note) His name\u2019s Joseph Smith.\nPETER: At Four-Three-Three-One Broad Street.\nOLIVIA: Had you know that?\nPETER: That\u2019s who Broyles is after right now.\nOLIVIA: What?... How?\nPETER: I don\u2019t know.\nOLIVIA: Peter, we need him alive.\nPETER: Hey. (answering his cell phone)\nOLIVIA: Are you there, are you close?\nPETER: No, I\u2019m on my way. You get in touch with Broyles yet?\nOLIVIA: No, they\u2019re still radio silent. I\u2019m gonna call HQ. I\u2019ll call you back.\nOLIVIA: I know they\u2019re radio silent, but you\u2019ve got to get someone down there right now, please. We need to get the message to them - they need to keep Joseph Smith alive.\nPETER: Damn it\u2026 (to his cell phone and failed call)\nAGENTS: Move \u2013 Move \u2013 Clear - Move \u2013 Clear\u2026\nFBI AGENT: You must stand back, sir!\nPETER: I\u2019ve got information.\nFBI AGENT: Sir, this is a police action.\nPETER: I need to talk to Philip Broyles.\nFBI AGENT: You need to get back. You are not authorized to get any closer to the house!\nBULLHORN: \u2026 come out with your hands up.\nPETER: Hey. (answering his cell phone)\nOLIVIA: Are you close?\nPETER: Yeah, I\u2019m here, but I can\u2019t get any closer to the house. They\u2019re already inside.\nFBI AGENT #2: On the roof, on the roof!\nFBI AGENT #3: Freeze! FBI.\nPETER: Oh no.\nOLIVIA: What? Peter.\nFBI AGENT #3: Freeze! FBI.\nFBI AGENT #4: Stop or we\u2019ll shoot.\nFBI AGENT: Drop your weapon!\nPETER: No, No, No, No!\nOLIVIA: Peter. Peter.\nBROYLES: (barking orders) Have the evidence response team catalog and box every item down to the toilet paper off. Bishop. What you doing here?\nPETER: I just got off the phone with Olivia. She\u2019s headed back to the airport. Turns out Mister Jones would only help us if he could talk to Mister Smith. The same Mister Smith that your people just killed.\nBROYLES: You\u2019re kidding me?\nPETER: That\u2019s the first serious thing I\u2019ve said all day.\nPETER: (cell phone rings) Hello.\nASTRID: Peter. It\u2019s Astrid. Your father wants me to inform you that there are fluid accumulating in Agent Loeb\u2019s lungs.\nWALTER: Tell him we need help quickly.\nASTRID: He says we need help quickly.\nWALTER: Insert this into his I.V. - let me talk to him. Hello Peter, this is me, your father. Walter Bishop\nPETER: Thank you Walter. I know who you are.\nWALTER: Excellent. Um, we need to talk to that man Smith right away. He may be our best chance to save Agent Loeb\u2019s life.\nPETER: I know that, but he\u2019s dead. He was shot. We\u2019re out of luck.\nWALTER: Well does he still had his head? Is it still attached to his body?\nPETER: Only you would ask that question. Yes. He still has a head.\nWALTER: Splendid. Then perhaps in this case, death is simply an inconvenience. Bring him in and hurry. Agent Loeb\u2019s tissue is already deteriorating, which makes it exponentially messier.\nBROYLES: What?\nOLIVIA: So close.\nLUCAS: You never did lose well. What happened Olivia? There\u2019s something that has shifted in you. Something\u2019s happened.\nOLIVIA: Well, a lot has happened. You know it\u2019s been a strange time.\nLUCAS: I wasn\u2019t gonna say these words, but here we are. So I\u2019m gonna say them. I have become -- and I\u2019m not kidding \u2013 a spectacular cook. Spend the night.\nOLIVIA: I can\u2019t Lucas.\nLUCAS: Of course you can\u2026 of course you can.\nOLIVIA: (her phone rings) Dunham.\nPETER: Does Jones know about Smith?\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: Does David Jones know that Joseph Smith is dead?\nOLIVIA: No - why?\nPETER: \u2018Cause if you can still get in to see him tomorrow, he may not have to.\nWALTER: Oh good, uh, bring him down here son, quickly. Get me ice.\nASTRID: You already asked.\nWALTER: And the halo head brace.\nASTRID: It\u2019s right over there.\nPETER: (to the Medical Tech) We got it from here, thanks.\nWALTER: Uh, did I ask--\nASTRID: -- to put salt water in the trough. Yes.\nWALTER: Ninety kilograms, not a drop more. (opens the body) He\u2019s been shot dead.\nPETER: Is that a problem?\nWALTER: Yes, that\u2019s a problem. Of course it\u2019s a problem! A bullet in the head would normally indicate significant brain trauma.\nPETER: Well it would also indicate that he\u2019s dead. But you didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with that.\nWALTER: This procedures not like removing tonsils.\nPETER: I\u2019ve never had a conversation with a dead guy before. Forgive me if I don\u2019t know the rules.\nASTRID: Is this going to work, or not?\nWALTER: I\u2019ll need to alter the procedure. And I\u2019m not making any promises.\nASTRID: Eighty-six degrees Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: Good, almost there. Let me know when it\u2019s exactly eighty-four point five degrees blue. Your brain is like a computer. Green. Just needs electricity to function - which the body ceases to produce upon death. Which is why we\u2019re keeping his body cold, to retard degeneration.\nWALTER: It\u2019s astonishing how this mans scalp resembles\u2026\nASTRID: \u2026 Peter\u2019s bare bottom when he was a baby.\nWALTER: How did you know that?\nASTRID: You told us that already \u2013 twice.\nWALTER: oh\u2026 What did I say next?\nPETER: That we\u2019re gonna kick start his brain.\nWALTER: Ah, yes! Excellent. Conductive gel to prevent the electrical current from setting him on fire. Spread it evenly. And don\u2019t forget his nipples. \u2013 Oh Peter!\nWALTER: In \u201875, the FBI asked me to use this procedure. Someone had been murdered. But I don\u2019t recall his name. Hmm. James, I believe. Or Jimmy. They wanted to identify his assassin. Union leader I think.\nPETER: Jimmy Hoffa?\nWALTER: Yes. Well, the \u2013 the trouble was, he had a shockingly low electro-sensitivity. When I turned on the machine, it instantly fried is brain like an egg. Everyone has the unique tolerance to electrical stimulation. Mine for instance, is remarkably high. Yours Peter -- unusually low. As for our friend here, we don\u2019t know. Too little current and won\u2019t work. Too much, and we will overcook his brain - so I will have..\nPETER: You ~ used to do this to me. You attached wires to car batteries and then you would shock me.\nWALTER: Yes, I was accumulating data.\nPETER: No, you are experimenting on me.\nWALTER: Son, we\u2019re ready. First we must test if this will register any brain activity. And this will indicate if he\u2019s transmitting any thoughts to you. Since he\u2019s dead, Peter, you\u2019ll obviously have to be his ears and mouth. Eventually, we\u2019ll connect this to your head. (to Farnsworth) Okay dear, we\u2019re ready. Turn it on. Try two hundred micro-volts!\nWALTER: Oh look Peter\u2026 he\u2019s talking to you. (bulbs explode) I suppose it\u2019s a good thing it wasn\u2019t attached to your head.\nOLIVIA: (laughing) I don\u2019t believe you.\nLUCAS: I\u2019m not kidding - looked into it.\nOLIVIA: You have not.\nLUCAS: I have\u2026 - so.\nOLIVIA: umh-huh\u2026\nLUCAS: Who was he? Whoever it was who broke your heart. Or\u2026 am I misreading you?\nOLIVIA: He was my partner from the Bureau. And you of all people should know that I\u2019ve always been a little inept at this. But, he was straight-forward, decisive, charming, and it was wonderful. Except it was all a lie, and he betrayed me. Betrayed the job. Then he died. That\u2019s the end.\nLUCAS: That\u2019s the end for him. I\u2019ve known this for years. I screwed-up\u2026 with you.\nOLIVIA: The timing wasn\u2019t right for either of us.\nLUCAS: Yes it was. I know it was. But I was scared. And that\u2019s the -- the God\u2019s honest truth. I think about you\u2026 so often and\u2026 I don\u2019t call because\u2026 because I\u2019m ashamed of how I treated you.\nOLIVIA: No, it was just\u2026 Lucas, I\u2026\nOLIVIA: (cell phone rings) I\u2026 I have to\u2026 I have\u2026 I have to get this.\nLUCAS: I hate whoever that is.\nOLIVIA: Hello.\nPETER: Hey, you\u2019re not gonna believe this \u2018cause I\u2019m not really sure that I do. But I think this might actually work.\nOLIVIA: Walter figured it out?\nPETER: Well, there are limits. Some issues and problems. But Walter seems to think we can get the dead guy to answer some questions.\nOLIVIA: Then we\u2019re on. I\u2019ll call you from the prison. Eight A.M. tomorrow, my time.\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m good\u2026 Thank you.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m going to go back to the hotel\u2026 grateful to you, to the incredible cooking, and your sweet words.\nASTRID: Do you hear anything?\nPETER: I think we gotta ask him a question first.\nASTRID: I see.\nWALTER: Are we ready to see how this is working?\nWALTER: When I say go, you Astro, will ask Peter a question. I will flip the switch, which will stimulate our naked friend\u2019s brain - and Peter, you will hear his response\u2026 any questions?\nASTRID: Uh, yeah, what should I ask him?\nWALTER: Anything you like. It\u2019s only a dry run - and son\u2026 I should apologize in advance. I\u2019m afraid this\u2026 Well, I shouldn\u2019t frighten you.\nPETER: No\u2026 wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\nWALTER: Three, two, one\u2026 Go! (rotates dial)\nASTRID: What\u2019s your favorite flavor of ice cream?\nPETER: OHHH!\nWALTER: Anything?\nPETER: Did I hear anything? NO.\nWALTER: Three, two, one\u2026 Go!\nASTRID: What\u2019s your favorite color?\nPETER: Nope, still nothing. Just extreme discomfort.\nASTRID: (answering cell phone) Hello.\nOLIVIA: They\u2019re taking me to see Jones now.\nASTRID: It\u2019s Olivia. They\u2019re taking her in.\nWALTER: No. We\u2019re not ready yet.\nPETER: No, no, no, tell her she has to stall.\nASTRID: Did you hear that?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019ll do what I can, but I\u2019ve only got fourteen minutes starting now.\nWARDEN LENNOX: (looks at watch) Fourteen minutes.\nDAVID JONES: What a pleasure this is.\nOLIVIA: We have your Mister Smith in custody. You will not speak with him directly. You will ask me one question that you want answered. I will relay that question to an Agent back in the States \u2013 who will talk to Mister Smith. I will then relay Mister Smith\u2019s response to you. Then you will tell me how to save Agent Loeb. That is how it works.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: You\u2019re very serious, do you know that? Your friend\u2019s life hangs in the balance. Is that it? And you want me to save him. I gathered as much from your note.\nOLIVIA: Tell me something. Why not your freedom, or extradition? You must realize that you have leverage here. Yet all you want is the answer to one question?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: You make two assumptions Miz Dunham, both incorrect. The first is that there is nothing more valuable than my freedom. The second is that I am responsible for the infection of Agent Loeb.\nWALTER: Hello, Gene. Shhh... Not a word. I think I know your problem. You think too much. It\u2019s a family curse. Your own brain function is interfering with the process. You need to be a passive receiver. This is a sedative. It will numb your higher brain function. I\u2019ve mixed it with a euphoria inhibitor, which will clear the high from your system in a matter of minutes. (to Astrid) If I tell you to, state this in his chest \u2013 right here. Beneath the breast bone.\nPETER: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. What is that?\nWALTER: Adrenaline\nPETER: Why Walter? Are you planning on stopping my heart? Walter, what are you giving me?\nWALTER: Nothing for you to worry about. Perfectly harmless.\nBROYLES: What is going on in here?\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Mitchell!\nOLIVIA: If you\u2019re not responsible for infecting Agent Loeb, who is?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Perhaps the same people responsible for bringing us together. What if someone wanted information from the both of us? You see? Perhaps they\u2019ve orchestrated all of this. What if you and I \u2013 both of us, at this very moment, were being manipulated.\nOLIVIA: By whom? And what would they want?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: You\u2019ve not been doing this very long, have you? There are very few things in life that surprise me anymore, Miz Dunham. And yet, I confess, I am confused. If it is so urgent to save the life of your friend, why haven\u2019t we gotten on with it?\nWALTER: Peter. Peter, can you hear me?\nBROYLES: This can\u2019t possibly be scientific.\nWALTER: Peter, looking at me.\nPETER: Daddy?\nWALTER: Hmmm. I think we\u2019re ready.\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Hello.\nASTRID: Go. Quick.\nOLIVIA: (to Jones) Go ahead. Ask your question.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Asked my friend Joe\u2026 Where does \u201cThe Gentleman\u201d live?\nOLIVIA: Mister Jones would like to know - Where does \u201cThe Gentleman\u201d live?\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Mitchell. Oh god. What is it?\nWALTER: Parasite in his bloodstream - choking him of oxygen. Asteroid, Nitroglycerine in a vial on the desk.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Wait a minute. I don\u2019t understand. A parasite?\nWALTER: Could you give us some room, please?\nASTRID: I\u2019ll call you back.\nBROYLES: C\u2019mon Sam, let them do their job.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: (after Dunham hands up) Is there a problem?\nOLIVIA: My phone doesn\u2019t get the best reception and prison isolation cells.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: You do have Mister Smith, do you not?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m curious, why do you think he would cooperate with you after you had him arrested?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Oh, the people I work with are loyal to the end. Can you say the same?\nOLIVIA: (her phone rings) Hello.\nASTRID: Okay, we\u2019re trying again.\nWALTER: Three, two, one\u2026 Go!\nASTRID: Where does \u201cThe Gentleman\u201d live? Did you hear anything?\nPETER: No. No.\nWALTER: We\u2019re going to have to increase the voltage\u2026 I\u2019m sorry son. Three, two, one\u2026 Go!\nASTRID: Where does \u201cThe Gentleman\u201d live?\nPETER: (in agony) Uh \u2013 Uh, Nothing. No.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, I need the answer now.\nASTRID: Agent Dunham, it\u2019s not working.\nPETER: (shocked again) I need some paper, paper, give me some paper, quick, quick. I see something.\nASTRID: Wait, hold on.\nPETER: Untie my hand. Quickly!\nASTRID: What is that?\nPETER: I have no idea.\nOLIVIA: I need the answer now.\nASTRID: We don\u2019t have it yet. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working,\nPETER: Walter, what is this? (studies his own sketch)\nWALTER: How do I know? You saw it, not me.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: He seems rather irritated with you.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, please. I have no time.\nASTRID: I know. You have to hold on. I\u2019m sorry.\nPETER: Walter, what is it? Do you see it? It\u2019s there\u2026 there\u2019s just something missing.\nWALTER: Obviously, horizontal lines. There\u2019s literature on this. Misrepresentation of horizontal space and unilateral brain damage.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: (mockingly) tick-tock - tick-tock - tick-tock.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, please\u2026 Hurry.\nPETER: I, I don\u2019t understand.\nWALTER: It\u2019s just a conjecture. But the bullet may have destroyed that part of the brain that helps process horizontal lines. We are going to have to fill in the blanks.\nOLIVIA: God, Astrid, I have no time. I need the answer now, Astrid! Please.\nPETER: Little Hill\nASTRID: Little Hill?\nOLIVIA: (yelling back into the room) Little Hill!\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Three parts Mebendazole. Two parts Thermophilic-Hydrolase. A syringe directly into the parasite.\nDUNHAM: Astrid, write this down (from the corridor) Three parts Mebendazole. Two parts Thermophilic-Hydrolase. A syringe directly into the parasite.\nPETER: Walter, look. The roots. They are dying.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Well, does that mean\u2026 is\u2026 is\u2014is Mitchell gonna live? Is he gonna be okay?\nWALTER: Yes, my dear, I believe he will.\nOLIVIA: Jones asked me a question about loyalty. And something about the way he said it, it felt like he knew something.\nLUCAS: Like what?\nOLIVIA: Something about my partner betraying the Bureau, I don\u2019t know.\nLUCAS: You know\u2026 I have other means of gathering information about Mister Jones. If you\u2019d like me to use them.\u2026 Say yes Olivia, it\u2019ll give me an excuse to call you again.\nBROYLES: Mitchell, I understand that you\u2019re feeling far from one hundred percent. But while you were unconscious, we made a discovery. That an organization with connections to \u2018\u2019The Pattern\u2019\u2019 may have someone working with us, on the inside.\nMITCHELL LOEB: John Scott.\nBROYLES: That was our first thought, but he would have needed to have higher clearance than Scott was afforded. We thought that perhaps you were talking to them because you might have discovered who that person was.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Scott\u2019s the only one I know of. You\u2019re making me paranoid.\nBROYLES: All I want to do is make you better. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Alright.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Sir. How is he?\nBROYLES: He\u2019s good. The Doctor here removed that thing from his chest. Walter made sure he saved it for him.\nOLIVIA: I bet he did. But what about answers? The question Jones asked Smith. And the response he got, Little Hill? We know that Agent Loeb was infected, but we don\u2019t know by whom. Jones says it wasn\u2019t him. We don\u2019t know anything.\nBROYLES: You have a problem agent Dunham. You\u2019re not easily satisfied, you want everything, and you want it now. In your mind, somehow a small victory is no victory. What you did was save a man\u2019s life, but that doesn\u2019t land for you.\nOLIVIA: Sir--\nBROYLES: I would tell you to \u2018snap the hell out of it\u2019. To stop whining about what you can\u2019t know, can\u2019t control, can\u2019t change. I would tell you to get some sleep while you can because tomorrow, we\u2019ll do this all over again, and guess what, you\u2019ll have a million new answers and a million and one new questions. I would tell you those things, but I won\u2019t, because your dissatisfaction is what makes you so damn good. Someone I\u2019m proud to say I work with.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nBROYLES: Now go get some sleep while you can.\nPETER: Hey, how you feeling?\nOLIVIA: I should be asking you that. Thank you.\nPETER: Thank you. You too.\nOLIVIA: You hungry?\nPETER: After everything I saw today\u2026 no, not at all. But I am thirsty. Really, really, thirsty.\nOLIVIA: Me too.\nPETER: Look at that.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, look at that.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: They\u2019re gone.\nMITCHELL LOEB: So\u2026 did it work? What we did?\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Yes. It led them back to Mister Jones.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Did he ask the question?... Did we get the answer?\nSAMANTHA LOEB: (whispers) \u2026 LITTLE HILL \u2026"

I thought we talked about this. You know about taking a break from the music so you'd have time for other things. Maybe something new.\nBEN STOCKTON: Dad don't get mad at me, but the windshield wipers, can you slow them down?\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Slow them down?\nBEN STOCKTON: The tempo. It's messing me up.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Sorry Bean, I can't. I need to be able to see.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Stop, I need help.\nBEN STOCKTON: What is it?\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Don't know. Let's see. (to Joanne Ostler) You okay?\nJOANNE OSTLER: Oh I'm fine. I can't say the same for my car. It kind of shuddered and then stopped. And my phone's dead.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Oh hold on. Be right back.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Thank you.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Of course. It's not a night you wanna get stuck out here.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Yeah I need a tow.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: (on cell phone) I'm on Route 12 About two miles north of Fair Oak. Yeah, Massachusetts plate, 332 EWD (to Joanne): Ah, they're busy. It's gonna be a while.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Then I definitely am not gonna make it to this business meeting, which would normally be a blessing but this one's really important.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Listen I-I know hardly a thing about cars. But why don't you let me take a look?\nJOANNE OSTLER: No no you've done enough. No. That's alright.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Transmission's dry. Some kind of electrical short.\nTOW TRUCK DRIVER: Hey easy. Didn't mean to scare you.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: It's okay. I didn't hear you.\nTOW TRUCK DRIVER: Yeah listen sorry it took so long. Man you okay?\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Where's her car? Ben. Ben? Ben!\nBROYLES: The boy's name is Ben Stockton. According to his father they were driving home from a school function last night when he saw a woman having car trouble. The father claims that while he was looking at the woman's car something happened. He said it was like time jumped. And his son the woman and her car were suddenly gone.\nOLIVIA: So he just blacked out?\nBROYLES: In the statement he gave police he insisted he never lost consciousness.\nOLIVIA: So any other witnesses to back up the dad's story?\nBROYLES: No but this is not the first time this has happened. These are from the files of three other missing person cases dating back ten years. In each one witnesses describe seeing the same woman. We've tried running facial recognition software. Nothing.\nOLIVIA: So what happened to the other victims?\nBROYLES: The first was found wandering the shoulder of I-91 Near North Hampton. The second in the supermarket curled up in the freezer bin.\nOLIVIA: Meaning what? They were let go?\nBROYLES: Apparently. But not before whatever'd been done to them drove them insane. Two weeks after she was found one of the victims actually tried to lobotomize herself using a butter knife. And all of them completely incapable of recalling what happened during the abduction. Even under hypnosis.\nOLIVIA: (reviewing case files) So they're all academics. A probability theorist, structural engineer... If we're looking at a serial abduction, then a ten-year-old kid really doesn't fit the bill.\nBROYLES: No, but other than that the details surrounding his disappearance are identical to the others. Interacting with the woman in the sketch, then experiencing an interval of lost time.\nWALTER: Peculiar flashing lights. Green, green, green, red. Like Christmas lights.\nBROYLES: How did you know that Dr. Bishop?\nWALTER: I don't know. But that's what happened. Isn't it?\nBROYLES: Yes.\nPETER: Think you might be able to jog your mind Walter? Could be kind of helpful.\nWALTER: Christmas lights. That's all I can recall. Sorry.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: I know what it sounds like. Like I'm crazy. I'm not. I talked to her. I touched her car.\nMAUREEN STOCKTON: ...police grilled my brother for hours. They treated him like a suspect.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: I know what I saw. She was real.\nMAUREEN STOCKTON: Why doesn't anyone believe him?\nJEREMY STOCKTON: You're wasting time. We need to find Ben.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I believe you. In fact we think that the same woman may be involved in a number of other abductions. This has happened before.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Why would anyone want to take my son?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. Honestly, he doesn't really fit the profile of the other victims. For one, they were all adults. And another, they were all academics - experts in various fields.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: What? Ben is kind of an expert himself.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Nine months ago, my wife was walking Ben to school. Some idiot late for a dentist appointment ran a red light. And they were hit in the crosswalk. Abby was killed. The doctors told me they didn't know if Ben was gonna make it either. He was in a coma for six days. And when he woke up... it's easier if I just show you. (starts a recording of Ben on the TV) This is the day I took him home from the hospital. He hadn't spoken, said even a word - since I told him his mother died... and we got home, and he just sat down at the piano and started to play.\nOLIVIA: He's very talented.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Before this, he had never taken a single lesson. His doctors told me there had been other cases - people with severe brain traumas waking up with the ability to do things they'd never done before. Two weeks later, he was composing his own music. One piece in particular. He stopped being interested in everything else.\nMAUREEN STOCKTON: You said the other people that had been taken were accomplished at something. Do you think that that's why they took Ben?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\n(the two women speak separately as Olivia prepares to depart)\nOLIVIA: Thank you so much for your time.\nMAUREEN STOCKTON: Uh, Agent Dunham.... After Abby died, my brother... he barely held it together. Without Ben, I don't think he'll make it.\nOLIVIA: I'll do everything I can.\nMAUREEN STOCKTON: (nods in thanks)\n(Ben sits in the corner of the the room, Ostler enters)\nJOANNE OSTLER: How are you feeling Ben?\nBEN STOCKTON: I wanna go home. I just wanna see my dad.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Oh, well - I have something better for you. There's someone else here who would very much like to see you.\nBEN STOCKTON: I don't care! I wanna see my dad!\nJOANNE OSTLER: Well your mother will be very disappointed to hear that.\nBEN STOCKTON: My mom's dead.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Are you sure about that?\n(under his breath, Walter sings a holiday tune)\nPETER: Hey, Walter. Don't you think it's a little early in the season For the yuletide cheer?\nWALTER: I'm reciting Christmas carols in an attempt to jar loose some details from my subconscious to remember where I heard mention of the green and red lights. But sadly it hasn't yet worked.\nPETER: So you thought it would be more useful to work on your Christmas tree decorations?\nWALTER: Though I - I cannot recall where I heard of the lights, it did give me an idea, a theory as to how the boy was taken. I was hired to design a technology, an intricate pattern of flashing lights intended to create a suggestible state of hypnosis. Theoretically the test subjects will do whatever commanded. Bark like a dog, dance a jig, wash the car.\nPETER: The U.S. Government had you working on mind control?\nWALTER: Not the government. It was an advertising agency. They hoped to broadcast the flashing lights during commercials so that the viewers would have no choice but to buy their products. Unfortunately, it merely caused nausea. Which was unfortunate because apparently, people don't like to shop when they feel like they're going to throw up. (to Astrid) Miss! Where is the remote?\nPETER: Oh, hey, Walter, Walter. Walter, dial it down a notch alright? (handing over the remote)\nWALTER: (to Peter) I posit that the flashing lights witnessed by the father induced a hypnagogic trance during which stage the child was abducted.\nPETER: I thought you said the experiments were failures.\nWALTER: Oh yes. But I focused solely on the timing and intensity of the flashes not the colors - the green and red. Now I suggest that those wavelengths are the key to success. Come. Let me demonstrate. Come.\nPETER: What do you want me to do?\nWALTER: Just stare at the lights.\nPETER: (stares at the lights) Sorry Walter. Better luck next time.\nASTRID: (coming into the lab much later) Anyone ready for lunch? What's up, Chachi?\nPETER: (looks at missing sleeves) Did you do this to me?\nWALTER: You did.\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: It's me. Based on the description by the father, I I.D.'d your kidnapper. Name is Joanne Ostler. She was a neurologist studying at M.I.T. She would have been thirty this March.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean, would have been?\nCHARLIE: Uh, according to DMV Department of Records, Joanne Ostler died ten years ago.\nOLIVIA: Are you sure it's the same woman?\nCHARLIE: Looks identical to the woman from your sketch, and she doesn't have a twin because I checked.\nOLIVIA: So what happened to her?\nCHARLIE: Apparently, her car went off a bridge in November of '98. Eight months before any of the abductions.\nOLIVIA: How is that even possible?\nCHARLIE: Here's the thing. The car was recovered but her body was never found.\nOLIVIA: So then it's possible that she survived.\nCHARLIE: Either that or Broyles has you chasing a ghost.\n(Walter sings more holiday tunes)\nOLIVIA: Hey. What the hell is he doing?\nPETER: He thinks it'll help him remember where he's heard about the red and green lights.\nOLIVIA: Okay. We've got good news. We think we understand how it was that Ben was abducted. Those red and green flashing lights. They put the father into a hypnagogic state. And we think we may have I.D.'d the woman responsible.\nWALTER: I have it! Christmas. Christmas. Leading to Christmas carols. One of which is Jingle Bells, which leads naturally to Dashing Through The Snow. Which of course inevitably leads one to Dash.\nPETER: To Dash?\nWALTER: Dashiell Kim. The man who mentioned the lights to me. I'm sure of it.\nOLIVIA: Where is he Walter? Can we talk to him?\nWALTER: I guess that would depend on whether he has succeeded in killing himself or not.\nPETER: What are you talking about, Walter? Who is this guy?\nWALTER: A fellow inmate of mine at St. Claire's asylum.\nOLIVIA: I think we may have I.D.'d another abductee. Dashiell Kim. Headed up Astrophysics at U Mass. Went missing in May 2006. Turned up a week later at his home outside Clarksburg, where he had a psychotic break. Bludgeoned his wife to death with a tire iron. He was committed to St. Claire's hospital.\nBROYLES: He was there at the same time as Dr. Bishop?\nOLIVIA: Walter Bishop claims he remembers Kim telling him a story about a woman who put him to sleep with a Christmas tree and then took him away.\nBROYLES: Green and red lights.\nOLIVIA: And he fits the profile. Expert in a scientific field. But I need you to get an interview request pushed through legal so we can arrange a visitation. Any specific things that Kim might remember about the abduction, like where he was taken maybe.\nBROYLES: That might take some time.\nOLIVIA: How come?\nBROYLES: Says here Dashiell Kim is a 10-27.\nOLIVIA: Yeah what's that?\nBROYLES: 10-27... Criminally Insane... with knowledge of state secrets. Apparently Kim had a sideline consulting the defense contract for JPL. You can't get in to talk to him without official clearance.\nOLIVIA: And how long will that take?\nBROYLES: If we go through channels, six weeks - minimum. I've got a contact at Justice. I'll tell him it's urgent. (takes a fax from the machine) I don't know how a guy that could do this to his own wife is gonna help you find a missing kid.\nJOANNE OSTLER: You've never looked at it in that order have you?\nBEN STOCKTON: No.\nABBY STOCKTON: Hi, Bean.\nBEN STOCKTON: Mom?\nPETER: He did this to his own wife?\nOLIVIA: 32 years of marriage. By all accounts they seemed happy... until Dashiell showed up after he was abducted, and beat her to death.\nWALTER: (looks at photo) Did I hear mention of my old friend Dashiell? Of course, I'd recognize his handiwork anywhere.\nOLIVIA: You mean he killed others?\nWALTER: Well he tried - a patient at the institution - Jasper, but actually I was referring to the equation. Dashiell was obsessed with it.\nOLIVIA: Obsessed in what way?\nWALTER: He couldn't complete it. I tried to help him solve it once and he came at me with a plastic spork.\n(watching a recording of Ben on piano)\nPETER: What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: You know Ben's father said that Ben became obsessed with this one piece of music and he couldn't complete it either.\nWALTER: I've been listening to it. It's very beautiful. He's light years ahead of where even you were at that age.\nPETER: Walter, take a look at this. See this function? It appears here... here... here - it just keeps on repeating over and over.\nWALTER: Yes yes it's a recurring expression.\nPETER: Or it's a rhythm.\nWALTER: Well yes I suppose. Are you suggesting--\nPETER: Can you convert that into standard musical notation?\nWALTER: Oh-oh-oh I can try.\nOLIVIA: What's going on?\nPETER: Music is a mathematical language. Chords have numerical values and their notes - 1\/4s 1\/8s 1\/16s - they're all just fraction variables.\nOLIVIA: Okay I took the oboe for six months and then quit.\n(after converting the notes to mathematic notation)\nWALTER: Almost there Peter. That's nine bars.\nPETER: Okay listen to this. Sound familiar?\nOLIVIA: That's Ben's song.\nWALTER: Yes. Ben's piece is the musical equivalent of Dashiell's mathematical formula.\nPETER: So how is that possible? They'd never even met each other.\nWALTER: It's not so surprising actually. Curious minds often converge on the same idea. Newton and Leibniz independently, without knowing each other, invented calculus. The relevant question is what is it?\nOLIVIA: What is what?\nPETER: What is it that both Ben and Dashiell are trying to solve?\nBEN STOCKTON: How is this possible? Are we in heaven?\nABBY STOCKTON: No, Honey, we're not in heaven.\nBEN STOCKTON: But I don't understand. I saw you get hurt.\nABBY STOCKTON: I don't understand either. But I do know that I'm here. And I've missed you so much, Bean. For me to stay you have to do what this woman says. You have to finish the song, Bean. You need to finish it. It's important, Ben.\nBEN STOCKTON: Okay. I love you, Mom.\nABBY STOCKTON: I love you, too, Bean.\n(they hug tightly)\nOLIVIA: Dr. Sumner.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Hello.\nOLIVIA: Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.\nBRUCE SUMNER: I understand you're interested in talking to one of my patients, although I - I can't imagine what help Dashiell Kim could be to the FBI.\nOLIVIA: We're investigating a missing persons case - a kidnapping, and we believe that before coming here Mr. Kim may have been the victim of an abduction himself, possibly by the same person that we're looking for.\nBRUCE SUMNER: I suppose you came by this information through a former patient of mine, Dr. Walter Bishop? You're the agent who took him three months ago, aren't you?\nOLIVIA: Yes, and you should know Dr. Bishop is doing quite well. He's been assisting us since he checked out.\nBRUCE SUMNER: He has no business being out among the rest of us.\nOLIVIA: Well, I appreciate your concern but I'm not here to talk about Dr. Bishop.\nBRUCE SUMNER: I respect your discretion, provided you respect mine. The mental health of my patients is my primary concern and subjecting them to open-ended interrogations by FBI agents is hardly prudent therapy. I appreciate your position. And I'd like to help, but I can't subject Dashiell to new faces right now.\nOLIVIA: Dr. Sumner I'm here because a child's life may be in danger.\nBRUCE SUMNER: There may be a way we can work this out.\nOLIVIA: I'm listening.\nBRUCE SUMNER: You've assured me that Walter Bishop is doing fine. If that's the case, I'll allow Walter Bishop to talk to Mr. Kim and ask your questions. It might do Dashiell good to see a familiar face.\nPETER: Olivia, there is nothing to discuss.\nOLIVIA: But it's the only way we can make contact with Dashiell Kim.\nPETER: Absolutely not.\nOLIVIA: ...Peter.\nPETER: You want to send my already mentally unstable father back to the institution that made him that way?\nOLIVIA: We don't have a choice. We need to speak to Dashiell, and without Sumner's permission, we need a subpoena, which is going to take time.\nPETER: Even if he speaks to Dashiell, what makes you think he's gonna remember a word that he says? The man can't even remember what he had for lunch.\nWALTER: I have noticed that you have a habit of referring to me as if I'm not in the room. Does anyone care what I think?\nPETER: Yes, Walter. What do you want to do?\nWALTER: I'd rather not go.\nOLIVIA: Walter...\nPETER: Olivia, he said no.\nWALTER: That is incorrect. I said, \"I'd rather not go,\" but I will. Every moment that passes is another moment that little boy's life is in danger. Isn't that...correct, Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Um-huh.\nWALTER: Then we should go.\n(Peter looks very unhappy)\n(Peter finishes signing a stack of papers)\nBRUCE SUMNER: Well, are you ready?\nPETER: When you get out, we'll be right here.\nOLIVIA: Good luck, Walter.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Come with me.\n(Walter looks anxious as he walks down the corridor)\nWALTER: (to unidentified patient) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't help you.\n(a familiar orderly apporaoches)\nFRANK: Dr. Bishop, how you been?\nWALTER: You know I'm not really back.\nFRANK: Yeah, well, it's nice to see you anyway.\nBRUCE SUMNER: You have ten minutes, Walter.\n(walks across room and sits next to friend)\nWALTER: Dashiell, it's me, Walter, Walter Bishop.\nDASHIELL KIM: Walter? You look different.\nWALTER: It's the beard. And you look different too somehow. That smile. Have they altered your medication? Wouldn't surprise me. These medieval quacks are more proficient at phrenology than psychopharmacology.\nDASHIELL KIM: I miss your jokes, Walter.\nWALTER: And I miss your stories. The one about the woman who took you away with the green and red lights. Dashiell, look at me. This is important. The woman, where exactly did she take you?\nDASHIELL KIM: I'm sorry. I don't know what you're referring to. You must be mistaking me for someone else. Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to sit here and finish my butterscotch pudding in peace.\nWALTER: You were always trying to solve it, huh? Yes.\nDASHIELL KIM: I don't do math anymore, Walter. Mathematical formulations are not conducive to my mental stability.\nWALTER: That's fine, but if you recognize the equation, do you not remember the woman with the red and green lights where she--\nDASHIELL KIM: I don't do math anymore!\n(disruption in background)\nWALTER: You used to tell me the story all the time.\nDASHIELL KIM: No!\nWALTER: You used to drive me crazy.\nDASHIELL KIM: I don't do math anymore. I don't care about math.\n(the orderlies intercept the duo)\nFRANK: Dr. Bishop.\nWALTER: No, I need to know where she took you, damn it.\nBRUCE SUMNER: That's enough! It's time to go.\nWALTER: Where is she?\nFRANK: I've got him.\nWALTER: Please, Dashiell, it's only --\n(Sumner injects Walter)\nPETER: What do you mean you sedated him? Walter is legally in my custody. You have no right to keep him here.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Not only do I have every right to hold him, I have a responsibility to hold him. He accosted Mr. Kim. If I release him and something else happens...\nOLIVIA: I can assure you that's not going to happen. He's under our supervision.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Perhaps that's what compounded the problem.\nPETER: Meaning what?\nBRUCE SUMNER: I had some time to talk to Dr. Bishop after he calmed down about his work assisting you and it is clear that exposing him to the pressures of criminal investigations while indulging his fantastical pseudo-scientific notions has exacerbated the worst features of his mental illness.\nPETER: Really?\nBRUCE SUMNER: Really.\nPETER: 'Cause after some of the things I've seen in the last three months, Walter strikes me as being one of the sanest people I know.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Is that so?\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna make this really simple, Dr. Sumner, Walter Bishop is assisting us in a criminal investigation which you are currently obstructing. So either you release him into our custody, or I will get a court order.\nBRUCE SUMNER: You go get your court order then.\n(Walter lies in bed whimpering when a visitor enters his room and sits at the foot of his bed)\nOTHER WALTER: (to Walter) Welcome back, Walter.\nOLIVIA: Where are we on that tip from Rochester?\nCHARLIE: Local agents are heading to the convenience store where they saw the boy. They're hoping video surveillance can confirm it really was Ben Stockton.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well have we set up checkpoints?\nCHARLIE: No they're working on it. So far nothing.\nND AGENT #3: I have the general counsel's office on the phone. It's about Dr. Bishop.\nOLIVIA: (on telephone) This is Agent Dunham... No, I wanted you to work around the protocol... Please, I need your help... I need to get Bishop out... Okay 7:00 a.m....Thank you.\nPETER: What was that?\nOLIVIA: Okay, we have to wait till morning for the court order to have Walter released.\nPETER: But then he's out.\nOLIVIA: I promise. And I'm sorry and obviously you were right.\nPETER: No, this was Walter's choice.\nOLIVIA: Okay. So if you want to go down to reception, someone can arrange a ride and then at least one of us can get some sleep.\nPETER: The woman who abducted Ben - Joanne Ostler - up until now everybody thought she was dead right?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Well she's been walking around for the last ten years, she must have been using somebody's name.\nOLIVIA: We didn't get any hits on an alias search.\nPETER: What'd you base the search on?\nOLIVIA: On the anagrams. Like combinations of different family names. It's what most people use if they want to change their identity.\nPETER: Thanks, I know that. I've done this once or twice myself.\nOLIVIA: Why doesn't that surprise me?\nPETER: The best lie - the one that's easiest to remember with consistency - is the one that's based on the truth. Whenever I would do this, I would base it on my own last name. Bishop. So Peter King. Peter Knight.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's a great idea if your last name is as simple as Bishop. What do you do when it's Ostler?\nPETER: Is there a computer around here I could use?\n(Peter works at computer)\nOLIVIA: (on telephone) This is a serial abductor so she's smart. She's probably switched cars since then. I want a record of every stolen car from the last 36 hours.\nPETER: (to unindentifed person) Hey, where does this print? (person motions) Thanks.\nOLIVIA: Every gas station from Middletown to Rochester, and pull all the credit card receipts.\nPETER: \"Ostler\"--Middle English for \"innkeeper.\"\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone) Hold on. (to Peter) Middle English?\nPETER: The point is \"innkeeper\" got me to hotels, so I cross-indexed last names that match hotels with her first name.\nOLIVIA: Joanne Ritz.\nPETER: No photo - just a P.O. Box in Clarksburg.\nOLIVIA: P.O. Box?\nPETER: Criminals don't really like people like you knowing where they live.\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone) Can you expand the grid search for Ben Stockton to Clarksburg?\nJOANNE OSTLER: What is it, Ben? What's wrong?\nBEN STOCKTON: I...I don't see it.\nABBY STOCKTON: It's okay, Bean. You're doing great, Honey.\nBEN STOCKTON: I can't. I don't know how it ends. (Blood drips onto piano keys) Mom.\nABBY STOCKTON: No.\nABBY STOCKTON: (to Ostler) Please I don't want to go away.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Well, that's up to Ben isn't it?\nBEN STOCKTON: Mom!\nBEN STOCKTON: (to Ostler) Stop! What are you doing to her?!\nJOANNE OSTLER: If you lose her again, you'll only have yourself to blame.\nBEN STOCKTON: (screams) Mom!\nWALTER: I'm sorry I upset you last night.\nDASHIELL KIM: Go away.\nWALTER: There's a little boy out there. He's in trouble. We're his only hope.\nDASHIELL KIM: I don't want to talk about math Walter.\nWALTER: Okay, okay. I don't need to talk about the equation. I need to know about the woman, where she took you.\nDASHIELL KIM: You're wrong. There was no woman.\nWALTER: Dashiell, if you don't, the boy... he'll end up like us.\nDASHIELL KIM: Walter please. I can't!\nWALTER: Yes, you can.\nDASHIELL KIM: It was so beautiful. She promised me things. What I wanted most of all, but when I couldn't solve the equation, she took it away. Everything she promised. It was all a lie...\n(flashes of Ben with a harness on his head, playing a keyboard and trying to solve the Equation for Ostler)\nDASHIELL KIM: ... none of it was real. She hurt me. She put me in a dungeon. She filled my mind with images of the people I loved... and then tortured them ripping them apart all the while trying to suck the answers she wanted out of my head. But I couldn't - I couldn't give her what she wanted.\nWALTER: Where were you, Dashiell?\nDASHIELL KIM: I told you a dungeon.\nWALTER: No! No! No! Not some fantasy you nitwit. Where were you really?\nDASHIELL KIM: Dungeon! A dungeon in a red castle!\nWALTER: You listen. You answer me. Don't you understand? No listen. This is the only way we'll find him.\nDASHIELL KIM: None of it happened. It was just a dream. Just a bad dream.\nBRUCE SUMNER: You're making a terrible mistake. Despite whatever strings you've managed to pull, your father is not mentally fit to be released from this hospital.\nPETER: Thanks for the advice. My personal assessment is that he's safer with me than he is with you. He may not be the picture of sanity, but yesterday when I saw him come through that door, I saw him change. He was afraid.\nBRUCE SUMNER: So what are you saying? Are you saying that I somehow Managed to intentionally harm him? Office of Homeland Security? How'd you pull this off?\nPETER: Meaning?\nBRUCE SUMNER: Meaning that since you were here last. I learned a little bit about you. Enrolling at M.I.T. based on fraudulent credentials. Starting businesses and failing, and then running away from the consequences.\nPETER: Do you have a point?\nBRUCE SUMNER: You are not a fit guardian for Walter and I'm going to petition the state to have him removed from your custody.\nPETER: Excuse me?\nBRUCE SUMNER: Whether you're willing to recognize it or not - Walter is a danger... both to himself and to others.\nPETER: Then I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 'Cause you may think you know what he's capable of, but you have no idea what I'm capable of.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Are you threatening me?\nPETER: I'd like to see my father now.\nBRUCE SUMNER: Uh-huh.\n(at the security gate)\nPETER (to Walter): Walter? Are you okay?\nWALTER: I'd like to go now.\nPETER: Of course, we'll go right now.\nWALTER: I've - I've failed. It was all for nothing. Dashiell went on and on like an incoherent loon about being taken to dungeons and red castles. Son, is that what it's like to talk to me?\nPETER: Walter... let's go home.\nCHARLIE: Excuse me ma'am, I'm Special Agent Francis with the FBI. I was wondering if you'd seen this boy. His name's Ben Stockton. He's ten years old.\nWOMAN AT DOOR: No, I'm sorry. What happened to him?\nOLIVIA: (answering cell phone) This is Dunham.\nPETER: (leaving St. Claire's) Hey it's me. I want you to know he's out.\nOLIVIA: Oh good! How's he doing?\nPETER: Yeah he's okay, but I hope you got a lead there because this was a total bust.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. So he wasn't able to connect with Dashiell?\nPETER: No, he's taking it pretty hard. He's beatin' himself up pretty good.\nOLIVIA: Did he get anything?\nPETER: He just said the guy was babbling on talking about red castles and dungeons. He did what he could.\nOLIVIA: I - I'm just glad he's okay.\nPETER: Yeah, me too.\nOLIVIA: And if any red castles appear, I'll let you know.\nPETER: Sure.\n(Olivia turns and sees a large red building behind some trees)\nCHARLIE: It's not a drawbridge but it's close.\nOLIVIA: This place looks like it hasn't been used for a while.\nCHARLIE: (on cell phone) It's Francis. Could you pull up a property search on an address for me?\nOLIVIA: Charlie.\nCHARLIE: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: I think I found something. (a ladder well)\n(Charlie and Olivia climb down and then into separate hallways)\nCHARLIE: Watch yourself.\n(Olivia locates a room and sees Ben)\nOLIVIA: (to herself) Oh, thank god. (to Ben) You're going to be okay.\n(Ostler enters the room and attacks Olivia. after the two fall to the ground, Ostler flees down the corridor. Olivia follows and orders her to stop)\nOLIVIA: Stop! Put your hands in the air!\n(Ostler uses a remote control to activate a green-green-green-red sequence of lights to hypnotize Olivia)\nCHARLIE: (startling her) You okay?\nOLIVIA: She was just there.\nPETER: Nice to be home right?\nWALTER: This place is filthy. Did you have a party while I was gone?\nPETER: No Walter I didn't have a party.\nWALTER: I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I need space.\nPETER: Oh?\nWALTER: Sorry to spring this on you so suddenly but... these quarters are very cramped. I think I am ready for my own room.\nPETER: That's - that's not a problem. I can talk to Olivia tomorrow about getting you some on-campus housing.\nWALTER: That would be very beneficial.\nPETER: You know what you did by going back into that place was very, very brave, Walter.\nWALTER: (quietly) Thank you son.\nJOANNE OSTLER: Got it. Now let's see if it really does what you said it would.\n(Loeb attaches a device to a safe and places an apple inside the safe)\nMITCHELL LOEB: Where's the equation?\nJOANNE OSTLER: Seems crazy that some numbers can make a machine like this work.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Look around your house your office, your kitchen - numbers make everything work. Here we go.\n(Loeb dons a glove and, with some effort, reaches through the solid back wall of the safe and removes the apple)\nJOANNE OSTLER: It worked. That's incredible.\n(Loeb kills Ostler with a pistol and takes a bite of the apple)\nMITCHELL LOEB: (on cell phone) It worked.\nOLIVIA: Ben, are you hungry? 'Cause there's a vending machine in the hall - I've got a roll of quarters.\nBEN: No, I'm okay. Thanks.\nOLIVIA: Sure?\nBEN STOCKTON: Mm-hmm.\nJEREMY STOCKTON: (finds his son waiting) Ben?\nBEN STOCKTON: Dad?\nJEREMY STOCKTON: Ben!\nBEN STOCKTON: Dad!\nBROYLES: Release forms. As soon as he signs they're free to go.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, uh, maybe we should just let them, uh, have a minute. Now I really need to call Peter and Walter. After what Walter went through, he'll be happy to know that Ben's alright.\nBROYLES: Good work."

Sorry.\nMELANIE: (marching quickly to the briefing room) I've been calling your cell.\nMARK YOUNG: The west side highway was a parking lot. Did they start?\nMELANIE: Yeah. Charlotte's been tap-dancing for the last twenty minutes.\nMARK YOUNG: Damn it.\nMELANIE: Wait, your tie.\nMARK YOUNG: Oh. Thank you.\nMELANIE: Don't forget this.\nMARK YOUNG: Thanks.\nMELANIE: And breathe.\nCHARLOTTE: And ExtenzaLife's market has remained remarkably stable, especially given Wall Street's recent financial difficulties. But let me turn things over to the man you've come to hear.\nMARK YOUNG: Hello.\nCHARLOTTE: Mark.\nMARK YOUNG: Sorry. I'm late. Thank you for your patience.\nBRIAN COLE: It's quickly fading.\nMARK YOUNG: Right. So let's get started. Okay, uh, as you can see from figure six, the three year rate of return on ExtenzaLife products exceeds that...\nBRIAN COLE: Well, Mister Young, a rocky start, but I'll be letting the board know we're in good hands.\nMARK YOUNG: Thank you.\n(alone in a room full of butterflies)\nMARK YOUNG: What? Ow! Little bastard. Ow! Son of a- ow!\n(screaming)\nBETH: (unseen, over the phone): Lauren and Craig will be here. Remember Craig? He's from South Africa?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I remember him. Are you sure Bobby's going to be okay with it? You know, Beth, not everybody like a surprise.\nBETH: Oh please. The man loves being the center of attention. Do you know how many times he told me that he didn't want a party for his birthday? Anyway, I'm glad you're coming. It's been ages since we've had a chance to talk.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, can you hold on one sec? I've got another call. (switches calls) Hello?\nBROYLES: I need you to pick up the others and get to the Marlboro Airport.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I'm going to tell you something and you're going to think I'm joking, but I'm not. I quit. Only just for the next couple of days and I'm happy to rejoin the others after the weekend.\nBROYLES: Runway fourteen. The plane will be waiting.\nOLIVIA: So, where are we going?\nPETER: Just your average multinational corporation specializing in secret bioresearch and defense contracting. Massive Dynamic seems like such an innocent name for a corporation, don't you think?\nWALTER: Hmm. That's odd.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: The lacerations on the body. These no doubt were caused by shards of glass, but these under the shirt.\nPETER: They were caused by the glass, how come the shirt's not torn?\nWALTER: A fall of such height would cause compound fractures, massive internal bleeding, all evidenced in this poor chap, I'm sorry to say, but wounds this delicate--most unlikely.\nPETER: So, what do you think caused them?\nWALTER: Too early to tell. It's a shame I don't have a lab--I'd like to examine him.\nPETER: You do have a lab, Walter. Your lab at Harvard.\nWALTER: Yes, I do, don't I?\nNINA: Mark Young was a capable executive who displayed no signs of emotional dysfunction. He was one of our more promising analysts, in fact. Popular among his co-workers.\nOLIVIA: So why do you think he would jump to his death?\nNINA: I don't want to sound callous, Agent Dunham, but when you run a company of over three hundred thousand employees, you sometimes see a small percentage who succumb to the stress of their responsibilities, and, on occasion, the nature of our work.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean by that? \"The nature of our work\"?\nNINA: Oh, I was simply referring to the pressure to deliver results, which the private sector seems to require. You would find it exhilarating.\nOLIVIA: Are you trying to change the subject by offering me another job?\nNINA: Well, I'd hate to sound like a suitor who's constantly being turned down for a date.\nOLIVIA: Well, just to be clear, as flattered as I am, I'm going to go wherever this investigation takes me.\nNINA: I would expect nothing less.\nOLIVIA: And I would expect more from you than the polite appearance of cooperation. You knew this man. He was a rising star in your company. There must be something more you can tell me about him.\nNINA: When one's domain includes the cutting edge of science, there is a risk of exposure to ideas that aren't easy to reconcile--certain realities. I'm sure you know what I mean, doing the work that you do. For some, it's too much to take.\nCHARLIE: You ever wonder how we survived as a species without drugs?\nFORENSICS AGENT: The, uh, hard drive is password-protected. Once we break the encryption, we'll send you his data.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you.\nOLIVIA (to Charlie): Well, he wasn't planning on killing himself three days ago. He just booked a plane ticket.\nCHARLIE: To where?\nOLIVIA: Omaha, on the twenty-second of December.\nCHARLIE: Christmas in Nebraska. Sounds depressing.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, well, maybe he's got family there.\nCHARLIE: You find something?\nOLIVIA: No.\nWALTER: Seems my suspicions were correct. These wounds go all the way down to the bone itself, as if they originated on the inside and pierced their way up through the body tissue.\nASTRID: How did that happen?\nWALTER: That is an excellent question.\nWALTER (to Peter): Peter, do you know what I've been remembering? Aspects of your childhood.\nPETER: That's charming, Walter. Blood samples are ready. Anything in there that explains those lacerations?\nWALTER: No, I don't believe so. Typical medications, all of them surprisingly legal.\nASTRID: So they wouldn't have harmed him?\nWALTER: That is correct. Although they could have been used as a carrier to transfer the foreign compound to the victim's brain.\nASTRID: What foreign compound?\nWALTER: Oh, didn't I mention it. Um, a synthetic in the blood. An ergoline derivative. Uh, perhaps he was treated for migraines, but it does not explain what caused these wounds.\nWALTER (to Peter): Coffee yogurt.\nASTRID: The synthetic compound?\nWALTER: Peter, when he was thirteen, all he would eat was coffee yogurt. Almost drove his mother to tears.\nPETER: Walter, that wasn't me. That was you.\nWALTER: Oh.\nPETER (on cell phone): Hello?\nWALTER: If that's Agent Dunham, tell her to bring some coffee yogurt.\nPETER (on cell phone): Can you hold on for one second?\nWALTER: He's right about the yogurt. In case you haven't noticed, I can be quite obsessive.\nASTRID: Really?\nPETER (on cell phone to Tess Amaral): Hey. Still there?\nTESS AMARAL: Yeah. Um, I'm sorry. I just didn't realize what it would do, hearing your voice.\nPETER: Listen.\nTESS AMARAL: No, listen. Don't bother making up a story, Peter. I know you're back. I need to see you. Peter?\nPETER: I can't get away right now.\nTESS AMARAL: Well, then, when?\n(Olivia sits in her apartment researching the case on her computer. she receives an email from John Scott telling her an address: 1312 Labrador Lane)\n(Olivia finds a box containing toads)\nCHARLIE: Hey, Liv. What do you know about a bunch of frogs? I just got a P.O. request from Agent Farnsworth, asking to send a terrarium and ten pounds of live insect larvae, and charge it off to the Mark Young case. Is there something you want to talk to me about?\nOLIVIA: Uh, I had some frogs transferred to Walter's lab.\nCHARLIE: These frogs. You think they have something to do with why the guy jumped out of the window?\nOLIVIA: Probably not.\nCHARLIE: Okay.\nOLIVIA: Charlie?\nCHARLIE: Yeah?\nOLIVIA: Come with me. You know how after John died you told me that I should maybe take some time off? You said that what happened with him was going to affect in ways that I couldn't even anticipate.\nCHARLIE: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: You were right. I feel like I'm going clinically insane, literally. I told you I saw him standing right in front of me.\nCHARLIE: This happen again?\nOLIVIA: And he's called me. He sent me an e-mail, and at first I thought it was him helping me like when we were partners. I know how it sounds.\nCHARLIE: Have you spoken to Doctor Katz?\nOLIVIA: Even though it's confidential, I'll still have a psych eval on my record. I know it seems so selfish to even say it, but I was thinking maybe I could just take a personal leave, just do nothing for a week or two and maybe clear my head.\nCHARLIE: Think that'll help?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nCHARLIE: Dunham.\nASTRID: Agent Dunham, it's me. Doctor Bishop wants you back immediately. He thinks you've cracked the case. You are not going to believe this, but, um, the guy who jumped out the window? Doctor Bishop thinks it's because of the frogs.\nTESS AMARAL (to man holding door): Oh, thanks.\nPETER: Hi.\nTESS AMARAL: Hi.\n(they greet each other with a kiss)\nTESS AMARAL: I wasn't sure you'd be here.\nPETER: That makes two of us. You look good, Tess.\nTESS AMARAL: You look older.\nPETER: Older? When my father first saw me, he told me he thought I'd be fatter, but I got to tell you--older actually kind of hurts.\nTESS AMARAL: Your father? Since when do you see your father?\nPETER: Long story.\nTESS AMARAL: Wait, listen to me. If I can find you, then they can find you.\nPETER: I know.\nTESS AMARAL: They'll hurt you.\nPETER: Can I get you a cup of coffee? Something to eat maybe?\nTESS AMARAL: Nothing changes with you, huh? It's the same old Peter, you just play it fast and loose until it's too late.\nPETER: Tess.\nTESS AMARAL: I mean, it was easy enough for you to leave the first time, why should it be any different now, right?\nPETER: I know that you believe that, Tessa, but you have to trust me, it was harder than you think.\nTESS AMARAL: Trust you? I'm not sure I ever even knew you.\nPETER: Yeah, you did. Maybe better than anyone. You still do.\nTESS AMARAL: What does that say about you? I'm not kidding. You need to leave Boston and never come back ever.\nPETER: Is that what you want me to do?\nTESS AMARAL: How can you ask me that? Come on.\nPETER: Tessa, look, it's comp...\n(Peter notices bruises on Tess arm)\nPETER: Michael?\nTESS AMARAL: Things have changed.\nPETER: Yeah, apparently.\nTESS AMARAL: It'll be worse for you if you stay.\nWALTER: Psychophysiologic effects, otherwise known as psychosomatic. The ability of the mind to cause actual physical changes in the body.\nASTRID: Mind over matter, like when you get scared and you get goosebumps.\nWALTER: Precisely. Although it is possible for the body to manifest physical changes imagined in the brain in a far more dramatic fashion. This test subject is in a highly suggestible state, as you can see in this archive footage. A form of hypnosis. I convinced him that he was in a meat locker. And what is more impressive, I told him that this ice cube was a burning coal.\nASTRID: Oh, my god.\nWALTER: Cruel, I suppose, but very enlightening.\nOLIVIA: So, Walter, what does this have to do with frogs?\nWALTER: Uh, toads, actually--Bufo alvarius, a species which secretes a psychoactive compound. The substance which I couldn't identify in Mr. Young was in fact a concentration of the venom produced in the skin. Properly altered, it's an hallucinogen, a very powerful one. Quite unlike anything I have taken. It directly affects the amygdala, which is the fear center of the brain.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that Mark Young hallucinated being cut on his body, and then his mind made it actually happen.\nWALTER: Yes. A very clever means of murder.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean \"murder\"?\nWALTER: Oh, come on, we've discussed this. I'm sure we have discussed this.\nASTRID: No, no, you and I did before Olivia got here.\nWALTER: The potency of the dose that I found in Mr. Young's blood was at least 30 times that that any sane person would ingest, which suggests that someone else gave him the drugs.\nOLIVIA: So whoever those frogs belong to may be the killer.\nASTRID: I ran a property record search on the basement where you found the toads, but nothing came up. How'd you even find it in the first place?\nOLIVIA: It's a long story.\nOLIVIA: Walter. Walter. The shed where I found the frogs, John Scott led me to it.\nWALTER: You've been seeing him again because his memories are still in your head.\nOLIVIA: His memories?\nWALTER: Yes. Trapped like fragments, snapshots in your mind. Your work on this case must be a trigger to some knowledge he had.\nOLIVIA: So how long? I mean, how long is this gonna keep happening?\nWALTER: Could last for many years.\nOLIVIA: I need to get it out. I can't keep having John's life flash in front of my eyes every few days. There must be something you can do.\nWALTER: Perhaps, using a form of repressed memory therapy, we may be able to bring the memories to the surface, and purge them from your unconscious. But...\nOLIVIA: You'd have to put me back in the tank.\nWALTER: Yes. Yes. And I would always advise against that. The risk of physical, not to mention mental damage, it might cause could be catastrophic.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I'll do it. I need to do it.\n(Peter spies on Tess and Michael at their residence)\nPETER (on cell phone to Astrid): Yeah.\nASTRID: Peter, it's Agent Farnsworth. Um, where are you?\nPETER: Just putting some gas in the car. Why, what's up?\nASTRID: I think you should just come back.\nOLIVIA: Ugh, Walter! How long is going to take?\nWALTER: Miss Dunham, what we're doing, what you have asked me to do, is pushing the boundaries of all that is real and possible. We're not roasting a turkey.\nASTRID: The library was not open. I had to go to the book store.\nOLIVIA: What for?\nWALTER: When you're in the tank, you must listen to my voice at all times. This is a technique I developed decades ago in this very lab. Most of which I don't remember.\nWALTER: Is Peter coming?\nASTRID: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Is that a bible?\nWALTER: Yes. Last time you were in the sensory deprivation tank, you went into a state of shared consciousness with Agent Scott. During that time, part of his memories crossed over into your brain. By putting you into a state of deep hypnosis, and by giving you substantial doses of psychoactive drugs, I can help you to access those alien memories that your mind has repressed. My voice is your guide. It is also your tether to reality. You must focus on my voice, or you may risk being lost in the memories. Uh oh.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: I just got an erection. Oh, fear not. It's nothing to do with your state of undress. I think I simply need to urinate.\nOLIVIA: That's good to know.\nWALTER: Will you get her in the tank, please?\nASTRID: Are you sure about doing this again?\nOLIVIA: All I want is for it to stop, but if his memories can do some good, then at least I wasn't deceived for nothing.\nWALTER: You'll begin to feel sleepy. You must listen to my voice at all times. Concentrate on the name of the man from whom you seek information. And look for signs.\nOLIVIA: Signs?\nWALTER: I'll tell you when you get there.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what was the Bible for?\nWALTER: Well, you're taking untested psychedelics, lying in saline with an electric charge in the base of your cranium. Among other things, I thought it appropriate to pray you don't get electrocuted.\nOLIVIA: Praise the Lord.\nWALTER: Amen.\nWALTER: Next!\nASTRID: \"Then I will sprinkle clean water upon you\"\nWALTER: \"And ye shall be clean. And of all thy filthiness, and all thy idols, I will cleanse thee and a new spirit I will give to thee. And a new spirit I will put within thee.\"\nASTRID: Wow, nice. I didn't know you were so religious.\nWALTER: I'm not. Not anymore. - - Olivia, can you hear me?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: Good. You see the end of the escalator, Olivia? You will step off in five, four, three, two, one. Take a moment. Look around. What do you see?\nOLIVIA: I see nothing. Just light.\nWALTER: Olivia, listen carefully. Apart from my voice, what else do you hear?\nOLIVIA: Music.\nWALTER: Excellent. Where is it coming from? You should be able to see something.\nOLIVIA: There's nothing. I don't know where I am.\nWALTER: Stand by. Anything now? What do you see?\nOLIVIA: Nothing. Wait, there's a door.\nWALTER: Good. Walk through it. Tell me where you end up.\nOLIVIA: I'm in a restaurant.\nWALTER: Does it look familiar?\nOLIVIA: Sort of, but I don't know why. This is where we had our first date. And there we are. This is our first date.\nWALTER: Can... can you see yourself and John?\nPETER: What's going on?\nWALTER: She's gone back in.\nPETER: What? Olivia went back in the tank? why?\nWALTER: Son, I need your help.\nPETER: Walter, you said that this was dangerous.\nWALTER: Oh, it is. Very.\nASTRID: She thinks John Scott had information about the man who killed himself.\nPETER: So, what, she went back in the tank to go talk to John Scott?\nASTRID: To see his memories.\nOLIVIA: Look at him. He looks so alive.\nJOHN: Maybe.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean, \"maybe\"?\nJOHN: You'll see.\nOLIVIA: So real.\nWALTER: I need you to adjust the drugs.\nPETER: Well, what did you give her this time?\nWALTER: Drugs I'd rather be taking myself. Set the IV to ten drips per. Peter, please.\nOLIVIA: I'm getting up. What should I do?\nWALTER: Fear not. This is just a memory. Um, just visiting. They cannot see you.\nOLIVIA: He's alone. John?\nWALTER: He cannot hear you or speak with you. You're in a memory. He cannot interact with you. Olivia, I'm going to take you elsewhere.\nOLIVIA: I loved you. Tonight, during dinner, I loved you, but you were lying to me about who you were. I mean, did you ever have any feelings for me at all, or was it all just...? Mark Young killed himself yesterday... He sees me.\nWALTER: No, Olivia. He definitely does not see you.\nOLIVIA: I'm somewhere else. I'm in John's car.\nWALTER: Good. Do you see any clues?\nOLIVIA: I'm alone.\nWALTER: He must be there. Find out where you are.\nOLIVIA: There's no one here.\nWALTER: It's his memory. He must be there somewhere.\nOLIVIA: I see them.\nWALTER: Who?\nPETER: Ask her what she sees.\nWALTER: Wh... what do you see?\nOLIVIA: There's four men. There's John, a black guy, one who looks Latino, and the fourth I can't see. I don't know who they are.\nGEORGE MORALES: Let's give him a minute. This is a big decision he's about to make.\nMARK YOUNG: Alright, I'm good.\nOLIVIA: Oh, my God. It's Mark Young. I see him. He's here.\nWALTER: Can you hear anything? Alright?\nOLIVIA: I'll get closer. Young's leaving with the Latino. I'm going after them.\nGEORGE MORALES: Now you just do your part, and we'll take care of you. We do this one deal, and it's hasta luego.\nOLIVIA: They've disappeared.\nWALTER: That's because you're not in their memories. You're in John's. You must go back to him.\nPAUL: You know if it's on time?\nJOHN: It will be. He'll deliver. He's just a little nervous. See the look he gave me when you told him how much you'd be willing to offer?\nPAUL: I hope you're right. If we get into another Ashley situation, we're screwed.\n(John stabs Paul)\nOLIVIA: No! Stop! No! Get me outta here! Walter!\nOLIVIA: So just a little less chin.\nASTRID: Okay. How's this?\nOLIVIA: That's it. That's the Latino guy I saw in John's memory. He's the only one of the four still alive. We need to figure out who he is and find him. So, can we get this to Charlie, and maybe we can get it ID'd?\nASTRID: Got it.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: You're on my clothes.\nPETER: Oh, sorry.\nOLIVIA: That's okay.\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. John's memories gave us a lead, so I better get a move on. I need to see Broyles.\nPETER: You want some company?\nOLIVIA: No. Thanks.\nPETER: Olivia, if you need me, I'm here.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I know.\nOLIVIA: We believe Mark Young was murdered for selling technologies to black market buyers. And we believe that this man was part of an underground group responsible for brokering the sale of a synthetic hallucinogen manufactured by Massive Dynamic's drug division.\nBROYLES: And what would be the black market applications of this hallucinogen?\nOLIVIA: The drug can easily be mass produced as a cheap street drug or worse. In its potent form, used as a chemical weapon. Apparently it can literally scare you to death.\nBROYLES: Then don't let me slow you down. Sounds like you're doing fine.\nOLIVIA: There's just one more thing. We're gonna need Massive Dynamic to disclose every project that Mark Young was working on.\nBROYLES: You're right. Although that'll be easier said than done. I'll see what I can do.\n(Peter blindsides Michael and they fight)\nPETER: If you touch her again, I'll kill you.\nCHARLIE: Any luck?\nAGENT #1: We've been running facial recognition software. So far no matches.\nCHARLIE: Witness sightings?\nAGENT #1: NYPD's passing the composite around Young's apartment building and office as we speak.\nOLIVIA: (into cell phone) Oh, yeah, I need you to cross reference all of John Scott's case files with Mark Young. Yeah. (sees Broyles enter) Hold on.\nBROYLES: From Nina Sharp... (puts files down) Mark Young's projects.\nOLIVIA: (to cell call) Yeah, can you call me back if you find something? Thank you.\n(she examines the files and deduces the phone number of the suspect)\nGEORGE MORALES: Hello?\nOLIVIA: Hello, I'm calling on behalf of your long distance carrier.\nGEORGE MORALES: I'm not interested. And I don't want you calling again. So take me off your list, okay? Hasta luego.\n(flashing back to John Scott's memories - GEORGE MORALES: We do this one deal, and it's hasta luego.)\nOLIVIA: I need this phone traced. This is our guy.\nCHARLIE: How do you know?\nOLIVIA: I recognize his voice.\nCHARLIE: You recognize his voice?\nOLIVIA: It's him, Charlie. I swear. (encouraging her fellow agent) Come on.\nAGENT #2: Almost there. Got it. It's a land line, but it was forwarded to a cell.\nOLIVIA: Where?\nAGENT #2: He's in transit on Route 3 heading to Lincoln Tunnel.\nCHARLIE: How far out are we?\nFBI TECH AGENT: About a mile and closing.\nCHARLIE: We got 'em. Name on the account is George Morales, age forty-three. Purchased a plane ticket this morning. Three forty-five flight down to Sao Paolo out of JFK.\nOLIVIA: So he must be on his way there now.\nCHARLIE: According to NCIC, he's a black market trafficker, high end.\nOLIVIA: So how far out are we?\nFBI TECH AGENT: Five hundred and fifty yards.\nFBI TECH AGENT: Echo flank left foxtrot.\nRADIO VOICE (off screen): Flank right.\nFBI TECH AGENT: Wait, he stopped.\nOLIVIA: What, did we lose the signal?\nFBI TECH AGENT: No, he just stopped.\nOLIVIA: So do you think he ditched his phone?\nCHARLIE: I don't know why he would. There's no way he could have spotted us. Looks like he hit traffic.\nOLIVIA: Where's the transponder? Let's go. Charlie!\n(Morales is hit by a taxicab)\nFEMALE VOICE (off screen): You okay? Call 911!\nOLIVIA: He's okay.\nOLIVIA: I'm told you wanted to see me.\nGEORGE MORALES: Yes. I want to make a deal. I'll tell you everything I know.\nOLIVIA: I'm not sure what you have to trade. Under Title Eighteen of the U.S. Code, we have you for possession of chemical weapons on top of suspicion of murder of Mark Young.\nGEORGE MORALES: I want protection.\nOLIVIA: You mean immunity.\nGEORGE MORALES: No, I mean protection. From Massive Dynamic. You need to move me from here right now.\nOLIVIA: What are you talking about?\nGEORGE MORALES: I didn't kill anybody. Why would I? That guy was a treasure trove of unbelievable things. Massive Dynamic killed him.\nOLIVIA: Massive Dynamic killed Mark Young?\nGEORGE MORALES: That's right.\nOLIVIA: Why would they?\nGEORGE MORALES: Maybe as a warning to any employee who's thinking of doing the same thing.\nOLIVIA: Maybe? I think it's easy to invent a story that you think I want to hear.\nGEORGE MORALES: Really? Did I invent ZFT? Flight 627? The Northwoods group? John Scott? The Pattern? The whole thing is, is a hoax. It's all a smoke screen so Massive Dynamic can do whatever it wants to whoever it wants. Do you understand that? Massive Dynamic is hell, and its founder, William Bell, is the devil. And I can prove all of it, but only if I get protection.\nOLIVIA: So why me? Why do I get the privilege of your cooperation?\nGEORGE MORALES: Because I know I can trust you.\nOLIVIA: You don't even know me.\nGEORGE MORALES: John Scott told me about you. Immunity and complete protection, and I will tell you everything I know.\nNINA: Agent Dunham, I don't recall seeing you on my schedule today.\nOLIVIA: Well, I don't need an appointment, Ms. Sharp.\nNINA: It's alright.\nOLIVIA: No matter where my investigations take me, they always come back here.\nNINA: Well, I don't know what you've heard since we last saw each other, but I would hope that my cooperation would have garnered some benefit of the doubt. Massive Dynamic has nothing to hide.\nGEORGE MORALES: It's about time. What took you so long?\nOLIVIA: See, I believe that your cooperation is an illusion. It never leads to something tangible. It only leads to more questions. And that's the point, isn't it? To keep us all asking questions? All just chasing our own tails?\nNINA: Are you sure you're feeling well, Miss Dunham? I think perhaps you're perceiving things that are entirely in your mind's eye.\nOLIVIA: I wanted to thank you for all your job offers, and I'm sorry that it's taken me so long to give you an answer, but I, um, I think I finally have one.\nNINA: Yes, it's obvious in your expression. Well, I understand that you've captured your suspect. I imagine that in an effort to seek an immunity agreement from your agency, he's attempting to blame Massive Dynamic for all his foul deeds.\nOLIVIA: Are you protecting your CEO, William Bell? Because if you are, now is the time to tell me. Once our witness talks, you lose all leverage in a plea.\nNINA: I seriously doubt that your witness will be able to provide any actionable evidence to implicate Massive Dynamic or William Bell of any wrongdoing.\n(Morales being attacked by John Scott)\nGEORGE MORALES: No, please! No, John, please don't! I won't say anything.\nNURSE: (Screams)\nOLIVIA (to Broyles on cell phone): Dunham.\nBROYLES: Our witness is dead.\nOLIVIA: What?\nBROYLES: Seems he was drugged with the same substance as Mark Young.\nOLIVIA: How? We had guards on his room.\nBROYLES: We don't know yet, but a nurse saw his throat open up right before her eyes.\nOLIVIA: Nina Sharp.\nBROYLES: Excuse me?\nOLIVIA: She got to him, and there'll be no evidence of that, just like you said.\nBROYLES: Dunham, Nina Sharp and Massive Dynamic have been nothing but cooperative with this investigation. I suggest you keep your unfounded accusations in check.\nOLIVIA: Walter. Hi. Can you come out? Um, I need to go back in.\nWALTER: In our room?\nOLIVIA: Uh, no. In the tank. There are too many questions. Like who's working for whom? And why? Who should be arrested? who's plotting what? And if John had the answers, Then the answers are still in his memory, which means that they're in my memory.\nWALTER: Miss Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Please, Walter. We're wasting time.\nWALTER: It's dangerous.\nOLIVIA: I am prepared to take that risk.\nWALTER: There is little that makes me happier than taking drugs. Perhaps administering them, designing and carrying out experiments that bend the plane of what we consider reality. I'm rarely if ever opposed to such things except now. But I tell you, you'll damage yourself. Every time you go back in, the risk of permanent damage--seizures, aneurysms, memory loss, death...\nOLIVIA: But if I don't go back in, others may die.\nWALTER: And if you do, the death could be your own. There are no guarantees that you will retrieve the memories you're looking for. And remember, there can be no interaction with him. You can't just ask.\nOLIVIA: He did see me.\nWALTER: No. No, that is not possible. Give me some time. I will try to develop a safer technique. But not tonight. You need to rest. Sleep well.\nOLIVIA: You too.\nGREGORY WORTH: (on cell phone): Tell him to have the money or I'll have to break his legs too. I gotta go. (to Michael Kelly) What the hell happened to you?\nMICHAEL KELLY: He's back in town, Peter Bishop.\nGREGORY WORTH: Peter Bishop, really?\n(Olivia receives an email from John Scott - \"I saw you in the restaurant\")"

(diverts wire circuitry) Alarm disarmed.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Roger, we're in. (walks to vault wall and inspects it) How are we doing?\nEVAN MCNEIL: Loop is up - you're good to go.\n(team attachs equipment to wall and computer controls)\nMITCHELL LOEB: How are we doing?\nRAUL LUGO: Good to go.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Okay - powering up. 3... 2... 1... charge.\n(wall vibrates)\nRAUL LUGO: Oscillation is good.\nRYAN EASTWICK: Ready to open the grid.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Where are we?\nRAUL LUGO: 96%... 98... resonance - set.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Give me the grid... (men expose wall to harpoon) Careful!\nRAUL LUGO: (fires cable through wall) Magnet firm.\nMITCHELL LOEB: How long do we have?\n(team dons remainder of gear)\nRAUL LUGO: Confirming density and thickness, 1 minute 41, 40...\nMITCHELL LOEB: Let's go.\n(team pulls way through the resonated wall into vault)\nMITCHELL LOEB: (looking for safety deposit box number) 610, 610, 610... Okay, we got it. Give me a charge gel.\nRYAN EASTWICK: (passes charge and checks watch) 57 seconds.\nMITCHELL LOEB: (places charge) We gotta move. (smoking door falls to floor)\nRYAN EASTWICK: 45 seconds\n(box is lugged to the wall)\nRYAN EASTWICK: I got it. Down.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Alright, let's move. Grab everything let's go.\nRYAN EASTWICK: Let's go, I need help. Get it up. (hoisting the box to the cable)\nMITCHELL LOEB: (to Eastwick) Okay, take it through.\nRYAN EASTWICK: (pushes the box through to the waiting McNeil) Okay, you got it? (checks watch) They gotta move or they're not gonna make it.\n(in the vault)\nMITCHELL LOEB: Lugo, let's go.\nRAUL LUGO: The magnet, it won't disengage.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Lugo... disengage it - we've got to go now.\nRAUL LUGO: You go, I'm working on it. Go! I'm right behind you. (tugs on magnetic harpoon)\n(outside the vault - Loeb emerges)\nRYAN EASTWICK: 15 seconds. What the hell is he doing?\nMITCHELL LOEB: The magnets stuck.\nROBERT NORTON: He can't leave that in there. We're screwed if he does.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Yeah! I think he understands that. (looks at watch) Come on.\nROBERT NORTON: (cable goes limp) We got slack.\nRYAN EASTWICK: 10 seconds, 9 seconds, 8, 7, 6...\nRAUL LUGO: (dons mask) Alright, I'm ready. Pull me through!\nRYAN EASTWICK: 5 seconds, 4, 3... (Lugo starts through wall) We've got 2 seconds, come on, pull!\nMITCHELL LOEB: Come on, push. Come on.\nRAUL LUGO: It's hard! Pull me through! (wall solidifies) ...ahhhh, ahhhh!...\nMITCHELL LOEB: (quickly) Grab everything, let's go. (retrieves pistol)\nRAUL LUGO: No, help me. Please?\nMITCHELL LOEB: (fires pistol) Let's go. Let's go! Secure that gear, I want nothing left behind.\nPETER: (entering the bank - to Olivia) What do you mean you don't have one? Everybody's got one. Even I've got one.\nWALTER: (interrupting) What's that, a spleen?\nPETER: Yeah, Walter, a spleen.\nWALTER: And this one suffers from Asplenia, a rare genetic condition in which one is born spleen-less.\nPETER: Thanks, Walter. (to Olivia) So, you seriously don't have a best friend?\nOLIVIA: Nope. Well - does a sister count?\nPETER: Of course a sister doesn't count.\nOLIVIA: Well, I guess that I've always just enjoyed being on my own. Even when I was at boarding school, they used to call me \"Han\".\nPETER: As in \"Solo\"? That's cute. At least you had a nickname.\nBROYLES: (on cell phone) This is Phillip Broyles with Homeland Security - please have him call me as soon as possible. (listens) Yes, and they'll connect you. (hangs up phone)\nAGENT: (next to the vault - to onlookers) Clear the area, please.\nWALTER: Ohhh. (sees corpse in wall) This is fascinating.\nBROYLES: A security guard was killed, the surveillance cameras disabled.\nOLIVIA: So, what do we have?\nBROYLES: Nothing. This incident may be related to a recent series of bank robberies - this would be the third.\nOLIVIA: All in Philadelphia?\nBROYLES: First was in Cleveland, the second in Baltimore.\nWALTER: (interrupting) I was in Baltimore. I remember a woman with particularly large breasts.\nBROYLES: Each time the only thing that's been taken has been a single, oversized safe deposit box. All without so much as a breach of the vault.\nOLIVIA: Are the boxes traceable?\nBROYLES: I have a call in to the bank manager now. The who, what, and why\u2026 that's you.\nPETER: Just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder.\nOLIVIA: (studies the corpse) Peter, I know this man.\nPETER: What, the guy in the wall? Really? Let me guess. He's your best friend.\nOLIVIA: No, I mean it.\nPETER: You know him from where?\nWALTER: To determine what happened here, we'll have to cut him out of the wall. At least pieces of him. I'll need some of this netting as well.\nOLIVIA: Raul. Raul Lugo.\nWALTER: You know this man?\nOLIVIA: He was in my first unit in the Marines.\nWALTER: Then you have my condolences.\nPETER: You're being serious?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. He's from Jersey. Uh, he's married. His wife's named Susan. He plays baseball. He lives in Edison. I've been to his house.\nRYAN EASTWICK: Bullet in the head or no, leaving a guy halfway stuck in the wall wasn't the most professional move.\nMITCHELL LOEB: I thought it was a nice touch.\nRYAN EASTWICK: You can joke about it all you want.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Yeah, thanks.\nRYAN EASTWICK: We had another grid. We should have tried to get him out.\nMITCHELL LOEB: How are we doing?\nEVAN MCNEIL: Crappy. Self-sealing bolts, magnetic tumblers, some kind of old-school chromo-alloy. Someone really didn't want this opened.\nMITCHELL LOEB: How long?\nEVAN MCNEIL: Couple of hours, maybe three.\nMITCHELL LOEB: We have one more box to go. If your bitching about Raul is your way of saying you want out, then go. Otherwise, inject yourself and shut your mouth.\n(inmates converse in German in the background)\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: (to his arriving lawyer) Mr. Kohl - please come in.\nWALTER: (wandering the aisles of TOOLRACK) This is amazing! The scale of this hardware store is unprecedented.\nPETER: Actually, it's completely precedented. There are stores like this everywhere, Walter. All around the world, in every city.\nWALTER: Well, if anyone knows that, it's you.\nPETER: Alright, what's that supposed to mean?\nWALTER: My last phrase?\nPETER: Yes, your last phrase... \u2018if anybody knows that - it's you\u2019. what is that?\nWALTER: I was implying that you traveled extensively.\nPETER: No, you were implying that I haven't stayed still much in the last 15 years. You were implying, and you've been implying with increasing frequency, that you don't approve of my admittedly nomadic existence. In short, Walter, you're saying that you're disappointed I haven't made more out of my life. That's what you're implying.\nWALTER: Yes, I suppose so.\nPETER: The reason this store seems like such a miracle to you is because you've been holed-up in a mental institution for the better part of the last two decades - which effectively does two things. One, it precludes you from knowing much of anything about me. About who I am, who I've been, what I know, and what I've done. And two, it renders any fatherly judgments you may have of me - moot\u2026 Are we clear?\nH.I. WORKER: Can I help you guys find something?\nWALTER: Oh, Yes. We're looking for an electric saw, preferably variable speed with an easily replaceable blade system.\nH.I. WORKER: : What are you cutting? Wood?\nWALTER: Human tissue. Flesh and bone. It's more sinuous than you may expect.\nPETER: It's really not that dire.\nWALTER: Oh, actually, potentially it's far worse.\nH.I. WORKER: Um, I think that the saw that you're looking for is around the corner, next to the routers.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nPETER: (to the retreating young lady) No need to call the police.\nKOHL: Mr. Jones, as you know, we only have so much time. So... the sentencing is scheduled for next week. As I told you before, I think the best we can hope for is life. However, I will be filing an appeal...\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: You've spoke to my people? Do they have any news for me?\nKOHL: Yes, they said that the \"job\" in Philadelphia was successful.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Good. Please tell them the following - they are to wire Mr. Loeb another $100,000\u2026 and to inform him of the location of the next \u2018item\u2019.\nKOHL: I'll pass that along.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Thank you.\nKOHL: Here is the document. If you would just take a quick look at it? This is a standard document for appeal. If you'll just sign on the... (watches Jones turn over the document and start writing on the back) What are you doing?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Items that I will need upon your next visit. My people will provide them for you.\nKOHL: Dramamine? Sun tan lotion? What are these for?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: As my employee, it really is none of your concern now, is it? What size are you? \u2026 suit size?\nKOHL: 40 long. Why?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: The address of my personal tailor. He'll fix up something nice for you. My way of saying thank you for all you've done for me.\nSUSAN LUGO: (answers door) Yes.\nOLIVIA: Susan.\nSUSAN LUGO: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Olivia. Olivia Dunham.\nSUSAN LUGO: Hello.\nOLIVIA: I'm afraid I have some bad news.\nSUSAN LUGO: (sits on couch) I just can't believe it. I just can't believe he's dead. Raul moved out about two years ago. We hadn't spoken in months.\nOLIVIA: You know, I am so sorry. And please forgive me, but did he mention these robberies?\nSUSAN LUGO: No. Can't say I'm surprised though.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nSUSAN LUGO: Ever since he came back from the war, he was just dark. Depression, drinking and I tried to help the best way I could, I swear to god, but...\nOLIVIA: I'm sure you did. Do you know anyone he was hanging out with? Any of his recent friends? Because I hadn't seen Raul in years.\nSUSAN LUGO: You knew Raul?\nOLIVIA: Yes, of course. We served together in the Marines.\nSUSAN LUGO: Oh, I didn't know.\nOLIVIA: We have met before.\nSUSAN LUGO: Who? You and I?\nOLIVIA: Yes, we had dinner here.\nSUSAN LUGO: You were in my house?\nOLIVIA: It took me a little while to remember because it was so long ago, but Raul and I met at Camp Pendleton - and we had dinner here, the night that he became First Lieutenant.\nSUSAN LUGO: No, you weren't here.\nOLIVIA: Susan, I'm sorry, but I was. And you were a wonderful host. you made pot roast...\nSUSAN LUGO: \u2026 and it burned. Yes, and we had to order in.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, and the delivery guy dropped the bag right here. And that piano was actually in front of the window - and the sofa was here by the fire.\nSUSAN LUGO: Yes, I remember\u2026 but you were not here. The day Raul made First Lieutenant - it was just me, Raul, and John.\nOLIVIA: Who?\nSUSAN LUGO: Raul's friend from Pendleton, John.\nOLIVIA: John who?\nSUSAN LUGO: John Scott. (Olivia looks stunned) Are you okay?\nWALTER: Almost there son. Get ready. I know you can do it. (saws hand off of corpse \u2013 plunk) Nice catch. well done.\nPETER: I'm carrying a tray, Walter. It's not exactly rocket science.\nWALTER: What I said before - didn't come out as I intended.\nPETER: What, the crack about the breasts?\nWALTER: No, about my disappointment in you. It has more to do with your potential than anything else. You have no idea what you're capable of Peter.\nPETER: That's sweet, Walter, but ultimately unfair - especially coming from you.\nOLIVIA: So, what have we got here so far?\nWALTER: Nothing yet.\nPETER: Walter seems to think that if we can examine this guy's flesh at the cellular level, we might be able to figure out how it is that they pass through solid matter.\nWALTER: What we perceive as solid matter is mostly empty space. Just as me may perceive that a life is full that is actually a series of empty encounters.\nPETER: He's been like that all day... it's been awesome.\nWALTER: To accomplish this, your bank robbers would need cutting edge knowledge of quantum physics - not to mention technology that would cost more than a dozen banks could hold.\nPETER: How did it go with Raul Lugo's wife?\nOLIVIA: (looking frazzled herself) Well, they were separated, so she hadn't had much contact with him for months. But she said he suffered from depression.\nPETER: Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I'm good.\nWALTER: No, Peter's right. Your pupils are dilated. It's a symptom of high stress. Unless you're using hallucinogens. (playfully) Are you tripping, Agent Dunham?\nPETER: (scolding) Walter...\nOLIVIA: I didn't recognize Raul Lugo - John Scott did.\nWALTER: You're confusing John Scott's memories...\nOLIVIA: \u2026with my own.\nPETER: So, you never met this guy?\nOLIVIA: No, but I could have sworn I did.\nWALTER: \u2018That\u2019\u2026 I don't understand \u2018that\u2019\u2026 I need to look into \u2018that\u2019!\nOLIVIA: Okay, but first we need to figure out what happened here. Who did this, what they want \u2013 and what they're gonna do next.\nEVAN MCNEIL: Success. (cuts open safe deposit container)\nMITCHELL LOEB: Nice job.\nEVAN MCNEIL: Are you ever gonna let us see what's in these boxes?\nMITCHELL LOEB: I don't think so. And even if I did, you wouldn't understand it. (opens container and sighs)\nNINA: Well, I thought we were making progress.\nCHIEF TECHNICIAN: We were, but we've hit a dead-end trying to reconstruct John Scott's memories. If we push further, we risk destroying the fragments we're trying to retrieve.\nNINA: Well, not to place any undue pressure on you and your team, but we're in a race against highly motivated individuals - and right now, John Scott is our only advantage.\nCHIEF TECHNICIAN: Understood.\nPETER: So, why did you need me to go get all that rice?\nWALTER: No talking! (playfully aims toy pistol)\nPETER: Seriously, Walter, what's the rice for? And while I'm at it, what's with all the toys?\nWALTER: Oh, these were in my storage. They're your toys, son, from when you were a little boy.\nPETER: Those aren't mine.\nWALTER: Then I suppose they must be mine... (quickly changes topic) It's the netting, Peter. I believe the swatch left behind was from a larger piece... that was draped over the vault wall. That - somehow is the key, although I'm not sure yet exactly how they would... (finds small doll) ah-ha!\u2026 ha, ha, ha.\nWALTER: (moves to a vibrating table with a beaker full of uncooked grain) Now\u2026 what do you see here?\nPETER: So far some rice and a bunch of toys.\nWALTER: This gentleman is standing on what appears to be solid. However, add vibration... (turns on motor) - I'm quite envious of this.\nPETER: Of what?\nWALTER: Well, somehow the robbers were able to weaken the vault wall. High frequency vibrations disrupting its atomic structure allowing another piece of solid matter through it. Well, obviously what I'm showing you here is a theoretical example. In actuality, this feat would be immensely complicated and apparently not without consequences. It seems that use of this technology can render one slightly - radioactive.\nPETER: How slightly?\nWALTER: Well\u2026 not as slightly as I thought. (to Astrid) Miss? Would you mind putting the hand on ice? It will help preserve the tissue.\nPETER: Just so I'm clear, Walter, the robbers have managed to not only violate the natural laws of the universe, but they're also becoming radioactive?\nOLIVIA: Who's radioactive?\nPETER: Our robbers apparently. Where have you been?\nOLIVIA: I've been working. Where have you been?\nPETER: I've been buying rice for Walter's toys.\nASTRID: Did you get any leads on the safety deposit boxes?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, they were all purchased 23 years ago. All paid for in cash, bogus names on each account. (to Walter) How radioactive?\nWALTER: Slightly.\nPETER: Though not as slight as Walter would like. So, we have no idea Who those safety deposit boxes belong to?\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) No, and it's untraceable. (to Astrid) Can you call all the hospitals in and around the Philadelphia area? Get them to call us if anyone comes in showing signs of radiation poisoning.\nASTRID: Yeah, I'm on it.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: Okay\u2026 so what's our next move?\nOLIVIA: Raul Lugo was a good kid before the military. He had a clean record\u2026 responsible employee. I want to know how he became a criminal. Why they recruited him and what they promised him.\nPETER: Alright, so how are we gonna do that?\nOLIVIA: Lugo's wife gave me some names. It just so happens his best friend from high school works at a bar in Cambridge.\nPETER: Did I just hear \"bar in Cambridge\"?\nOLIVIA: Hey, Astrid, would you mind...\nASTRID: Watching Walter? Yeah, I'm on that, too.\nWALTER: Now, Miss, I'm going to repeat the demonstration with the rice. Would you care to watch?\nASTRID: Nope.\nWALTER: Okay.\nOLIVIA: Just go along with this, okay?\nPETER: Sure thing, boss.\nOLIVIA: (to the bartender) Hi.\nDREW: Hey.\nOLIVIA: How's your night?\nDREW: I've had worse. What can I get you?\nOLIVIA: Double shot of whiskey.\nDREW: A double. What's your preference?\nOLIVIA: Your call.\nDREW: (to Peter) You?\nPETER: Same as the lady.\nOLIVIA: I'm Stephanie. This is my brother, Rick.\nDREW: Hey Brother Rick.\nPETER: Hi.\nOLIVIA: You know, you look familiar.\nDREW: Who? Me?\nPETER: Cheers.\nOLIVIA: (downs her drink) Um... I'll take another. Are you sure we haven't met before?\nDREW: I don't think so.\nOLIVIA: What's your name?\nDREW: Drew.\nOLIVIA: Drew, I got to tell you, I never forget a face.\nPETER: It's true, she doesn't. It's kind of creepy actually.\nOLIVIA: I got it. Raul and Susan's wedding.\nDREW: No way. You were there?\nOLIVIA: You were the best man.\nDREW: Yeah.\nPETER: It's incredible, right? She's been able to do that since we were kids. Remember that?\nOLIVIA: I do. So do you still see them?\nDREW: No, it's been years.\nOLIVIA: I was friends with Susan in college, but we lost contact, too. It's horrible. Where are they living now?\nDREW: You know, I don't know. I heard they split.\nOLIVIA: Oh, No.\nDREW: Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.\nOLIVIA: Why not?\nDREW: I don't know. Raul got weird.\nOLIVIA: Weird how?\nDREW: You know he was in the gulf war? He sort of... I don't know, it was post-traumatic stress or something. I feel bad. I'm sure I would have lost my mind if I'd gone to the gulf war as well. Anyway, when he got back, he didn't come around much. He started hanging out at the V.A. a lot.\nOLIVIA: Which one?\nDREW: I don't know.\nCUSTOMER: Bartender\nDREW: It's a shame. He was a good guy. Excuse me. (he walks off)\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nPETER: Brother?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. It, uh... it kind of works better that way.\nPETER: Does it now?\nBROYLES: (answering phone in office) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: (calling from bar) It's Dunham. Look, I was wondering if you could find out what V.A. hospital Raul Lugo might have gone to.\nBROYLES: There was nothing in any of his records.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I know. That's why I'm calling you. Can you help me?\nBROYLES: I'll do what I can. I'll have an answer for you in an hour.\nOLIVIA: Thanks. (hangs up phone)\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) Let's go. He is gonna call us back in an hour.\nPETER: Whoa, whoa, whoa\u2026 what's the rush? Two is your limit?\nOLIVIA: Is that a dare?\nEVAN MCNEIL: Rook to E-7.\nROBERT NORTON: Check. So, I took a look at his papers while he was checking out whatever was in that box we grabbed.\nEVAN MCNEIL: So?\nROBERT NORTON: It's a map of Germany.\nEVAN MCNEIL: Germany?\nROBERT NORTON: Yeah, Frankfurt. Lines all over it. Latitude and longitude. Looks like he's planning a damn invasion.\nRYAN EASTWICK: I got next.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Alright, listen up. We're headed out. Let's go.\nEVAN MCNEIL: Where to?\nMITCHELL LOEB: Providence.\nPETER: Pick a card. (she does) Alright. Now, I need you to memorize that card.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: You got it?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I got it.\nPETER: You sure?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nPETER: Absolutely positive?\nOLIVIA: Absolutely positive.\nPETER: Because if you don't, it doesn't work.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I remember.\nPETER: Okay, good.\nPETER: (makes card disappear) \u2026and just like everything else we do around here.. it's about to get weirder. (holds up bottle where card reappeared) It's pretty good, right?\nOLIVIA: That was great.\nPETER: Okay, so top that.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: Seriously?\nOLIVIA: Oh, that's fantastic.\nPETER: Women never have card tricks.\nOLIVIA: Tell me when to stop. (counts out cards) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...\nPETER: Stop.\nOLIVIA: Which one? (he points) Four of clubs. (Peter turns over the predicted card) Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...\nPETER Stop.\nOLIVIA: (Peter turns over the predicted card) Queen of diamonds.\nPETER: You can count cards.\nOLIVIA: That's all I would do when I was a kid. I'm sure that if I was a child today, I would be diagnosed with something. I just have this thing for numbers. I see them once and remember them the rest of my life.\nPETER: Seriously?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, my best friend from high school's license plate - 7240168. My locker combination in middle school - 36-21-7. The numbers of the safety deposit boxes - 233, 377, and 610.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: I could do more.\nPETER: No, no, no\u2026 Say that again. The numbers on the safety deposit boxes.\nOLIVIA: 233, 377, and 610. Why?\nPETER: I know those numbers.\nPETER: Walter? Hey, Walter! Wake up! Walter. Walter, wake up. This is important.\nWALTER: (jostled awake) oh, oh, Oh?\u2026 Do you two want to use the room?\nPETER: Walter, this is important. The numbers you recite every night, what are they?\nWALTER: Numbers?\nPETER: Every night you recite a sequence of numbers to help you fall asleep. 233, 377, 610\u2026\nWALTER: ...987, 1,597.\nPETER: Precisely, those. What is that pattern?\nWALTER: It's a Fibonacci Sequence. You should know that, Peter. If you had stayed at college...\nOLIVIA: Walter, not everybody knows the Fibonacci Sequence.\nWALTER: Oh, sure they do. It's a wildly famous mathematical sequence. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding.\nPETER: Including 233, 377, and 610, Which just happened to be the numbers of the safety deposit boxes that were stolen.\nWALTER: It's fascinating, but it's a coincidence. It can't possibly be significant. Unless... Oh, my god.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: The safety deposit boxes are mine.\nWALTER: (pacing the room) Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia\u2026 Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia\u2026 now\u2026\nOLIVIA: Walter, are there any other safety deposit boxes that haven't been broken into yet?\nWALTER: I don't know. I don't know where - because I can't remember why I put things into the boxes.\nPETER: Alright, so let me get this straight. You can remember traveling around the country 23 years ago, renting all these safety deposit boxes under assumed names\u2026 but you can't remember why?\nWALTER: The \"why\" is of secondary importance to \"what\". What was I protecting? Whatever it was, I didn't use my usual hiding places, so, I suspect it was something of profound significance.\nPETER: Well, excellent. That clears it right up.\nWALTER: I was under a great deal of stress at the time. It - it was before the accident in the lab - before that poor lab assistant lost her life. (sits and take bottle from night stand) I was... distrustful of everybody. Even better, your mother. I was convinced I was being followed. Someone was watching my every move. (drinks dissolved medication)\nPETER: Which medication is that Walter?\nWALTER: Supplements.\nOLIVIA: Walter, did you tell anybody else?\nWALTER: hoo... hmm\u2026 I told you I was paranoid.\nOLIVIA: Okay, get dressed - we're going out.\nWALTER: Breakfast?\nCHARLIE: According to your travel records, in 1985, you gave a lecture at Syracuse University. Now, these photos are of banks in the Syracuse area. Does any of this trigger anything in your mind?\nWALTER: (glances at photos) Yes, but not about banks. Think back 20 years - imagine yourself then, imagining yourself now - 20 years into the future. In your wildest imagination, could you ever think you'd be here?\nCHARLIE: (softly to Olivia) Is he stoned?\nOLIVIA: Just show him the other batch, and be patient with him. (watch Walter licking photo) His mind works in a different way. (Charlie raises his eyebrows)\nBROYLES: (enters room) Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: What's up?\nBROYLES: After he split up with his wife - Raul Lugo moved to D.C. (hands her a file) He was an in-patient at the V.A. there for six months, from last May to mid-October.\nOLIVIA: No visitors?\nBROYLES: Not according to the records. I don't know what that does to your theory he was recruited there.\nOLIVIA: Unless it was by another patient.\nNINA: You have something?\nCHIEF TECHNICIAN: Something remarkable, actually. When we tried to access Agent Scott's hippocampus, his brain-wave echo suddenly became erratic. Inconsistent in ways we've never seen.\nNINA: And the cause of the inconsistency?\nCHIEF TECHNICIAN: We managed to resolve the last image in Agent Scott's optic nerve before he died. This image is linked to a second set of brainwave echoes. (hands Nina a file) Agent Dunham's. They must have somehow shared consciousness. If that's the case, it would suggest that some of John Scott's memories, perhaps the very ones we need...\nNINA: \u2026are in Agent Dunham's mind.\nOLIVIA: (introduces herself to orderly Ed \"Smitty\" Smith) Hi. I\u2019m Agent Dunham with D.H.S. I'm looking for Dr. Bruce Miller? (receives direction) Thank you. Excuse me, Dr. Miller? Agent Olivia Dunham. I'm with D.H.S.\nBRUCE MILLER: What can I do for you Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: I wanted to talk to you about a patient of yours. Raul Lugo. Marine Force Recon. History of P.T.S.D.\nBRUCE MILLER: I'm sure you know I can't violate patient confidentiality.\nOLIVIA: Raul Lugo is dead Dr. Miller - so his right to confidentiality no longer applies. I'm investigating his death and I need to know about his friends\u2026 anyone he was doing therapy with - or people that he got close to...\nBRUCE MILLER: If you're referring to current or former patients, those records are also protected.\nOLIVIA: Unless they're involved in ongoing criminal activity, in which case it would be your duty to release them to me.\nBRUCE MILLER: What crimes?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, I'm not authorized to tell you that. Suffice to say, the team of criminals I'm investigating are all highly trained, well-skilled, and...\nBRUCE MILLER: Agent Dunham, I have two dozen patients to see before I can go home to dinner. And I'm not about to violate my ethical duty based on your say-so. Now, if you would like to come back with a Federal subpoena I would be glad to help you out... but until then, you'll have to excuse me.\n(they part ways. she starts a cell phone call and is intercepted)\nED SMITH: He liked to play chess. Raul. He used to play chess all day long.\nOLIVIA: With anyone in particular?\nED SMITH: There were four of them. The Chess Club.\nOLIVIA: And do you remember their names?\nED SMITH: Get a pencil.\nMITCHELL LOEB: (departing with team and equipment) Let's go. Let's go. Let's move. (getting in van) Let's go. Door! Let's move!\nAGENT #2: Robert Norton, Captain, United States Air Force. Honorably discharged April of '04.\nCHARLIE: Pull up his cell phone records and his financials. See if there's anything else that ties him to Lugo.\nAGENT #2: I'm on it.\nOLIVIA: These are the V.A. visitor logs. These men were recruited. I want you to comb the logs and follow up on every entry.\nND AGENT: I just talked to Evan McNeil's wife. Says her husband's away on business. She hasn't heard from him in two days.\nOLIVIA: Call his work and see if they know where he is.\nCHARLIE: Alright, we got something. One of our vets bought three one-way tickets to T.F. Green Airport in Providence.\nOLIVIA: When do they land?\nCHARLIE: 47 minutes ago.\nPETER: (takes call in lab from Olivia) Hey, what's up?\nOLIVIA: We think the next bank hit is gonna go down in Providence. Can you talk to Walter and see if it jogs his memory?\nPETER: Yeah, sure.\nWALTER: (to Astrid about Gene, the cow) Down strokes only\u2026 you brush with the grain.\nPETER: Hey Walter, are any of those banks you rented the safety deposit boxes in Providence?\nWALTER: I don't believe so, No. I'm sorry Peter, I have tried everything to remember. I understand how important it is, and I am quite disappointed with myself.\nPETER: (to Olivia at her office) Hold on a sec.\nWALTER: (to Astrid) When she's finished chewing her cud, remember to brush her teeth.\nASTRID: I am not brushing a cow's teeth Walter. You know I have real work to do, right?\nPETER: Hey, Walter. If you were gonna rent a safety deposit box in Providence, what bank would you use?\nWALTER: Providence? That would have to be the Fairmont Savings Bank, off Westminster Street\u2026 It's the only one with safe deposit boxes big enough for my purposes. (realizing how he was manipulated) Oh...well done, son.\nPETER: The Fairmont Savings Bank off Westminster Street.\nOLIVIA: You're sure?\nPETER: Oh, yeah. I'm sure.\n(entering the building headed for the vault)\nSAM MARTIN: Agents, Sam Martin. Providence S.A.C.\nCHARLIE: Francis and Dunham. So, what's our status?\nSAM MARTIN: All surrounding streets are locked down. Per your request, my men are checking all shared walls and alley ways. This is Mr. Grimes, he manages the bank.\nGRIMES: I don't understand. We've had no alarms or signs of forced entry.\nOLIVIA: Well, this crew doesn't work like that, Mr. Grimes.\n(entering the vault)\nGRIMES: We have cameras, motion detectors, sensors that detect fractional variances in ambient temperature.\nCHARLIE: They might be disabling that wirelessly. Shooting you a feed back loop of old data while they stop and shop.\nGRIMES: Oh, my god.\nOLIVIA: 9-8-7. - It's the next number in the Fibonacci Sequence.\nSAM MARTIN: These four walls are internal to the bank. I don't care how they got in here, they're still in my perimeter.\nCHARLIE: This layout's not easy. And even if they did get through one of these walls, they've got multiple other walls on every side. They wouldn't have time to breach them all.\nOLIVIA: What's underneath? A basement or access tunnels?\nGRIMES: This is the basement. There's two feet of solid steel and then the foundation. Everything under that belongs to the city. Gas mains, sewer, electric.\nOLIVIA: Sewer.\nCHARLIE: Providence PD, I need the closest sewer line exit to Fairmont Savings Bank.\n(on a side street exiting sewer access)\nMITCHELL LOEB: (to crew loading van) Let's go.\nCHARLIE: F.B.I. - Freeze! (shoots - missing - chasing on foot with Olivia)\nEVAN MCNEIL: : Come on! Come on! (van races away leaving Ryan Eastwick) Come on, man! Come on, you can do it!\nEVAN MCNEIL: Come on! (Ryan Eastwick runs after van)\nEVAN MCNEIL: Reach out a little further! Come on! (Ryan Eastwick nearly catches van)\nEVAN MCNEIL: Come on, man, you've almost got it! (Olivia shoots Ryan Eastwick in the leg, as van speeds off)\nCHARLIE: This is Francis, I.D. number 3-1-5-5-6. I need a \u2018bolo\u2019 on a black cargo van heading south on Westminster. License plate number 10562-Sierra. I also need E.M.S. - suspect down.\nEVAN MCNEIL: Damn it!\nMITCHELL LOEB: Shut up. Scrub down and take your shots. I want this box open now.\nEVAN MCNEIL: Not until you show me what this is all about. (Loeb saunters to the stolen box and reveals complex equipment inside) One guy dead, another put away. For that? A camera or something? What the hell is it?\nMITCHELL LOEB: A word of advice... don't pry into things you couldn't possibly understand. (into his cellphone) We're on. He's coming tonight.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Perfect. (inspecting the goods brought to him) Very good. I see you didn't take me up on my offer to go see my tailor.\nKOHL: No, I like this suit. It's always been lucky for me.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Well I can appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Kohl. Come back in the morning with the paperwork for my appeal. 6:30 sharp? I'll be happy to sign it then. Oh, and wear one of your lucky suits.\nKOHL: Will there be anything else?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: As a matter of fact, Yes. I'll need my people to procure... one last item.\nKOHL: And what would that be?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Not a \"what\", Mr. Kohl. In this case, a \"whom\".\nABDUCTOR (MAN #1): (unseen assailant in the parking garage - viewing Olivia) Target in sight.\n(in the interrogation room)\nOLIVIA: We have your service record, Mr. Eastwick. Your 10-40's. We know everything about you. Except what it was that you wanted so badly you'd walk through a solid wall.\nRYAN EASTWICK: Ryan Shawn Eastwick, Staff Sergeant, First Special Forces Group, 3rd Battalion. 29-869-617.\nOLIVIA: You're not a P.O.W. Eastwick. You're a criminal.\n(in the observation room)\nPETER: Look at his hands. They look a little jittery.\nCHARLIE: She's wearing him down.\nPETER: No, I don't think so. That looks physiological.\n(OLIVIA in background: ...that's over 20 years in Federal Prison. Is that any way for a decorated combat veteran...)\nPETER: Call her out, would you? I got an idea.\nCHARLIE: I wasn't aware you had a background in interrogation.\nPETER: I've been in rooms like that, on both sides of the table. This will either work or it won't. Either way, it's only two minutes of your time.\n(OLIVIA: on intercom ...we already have enough proof to put you down for armed robbery times three... that's over 20 years in a federal prison. Do you think the prisoners there will care that you were once a hero fighting for your country?)\n(Charlie text-mails her)\n(in the interrogation room)\n(bzzzzzz... Olivia reads her text-mail and meets Peter at the door)\nOLIVIA: We lose him, we lose time. We lose everything. (walks away)\nPETER: Look. You're a tough guy. I'm a tough guy. I think we can dispense with the formalities. I'm not gonna stick a thumb in that shot-up leg of yours because 'A' - I think that's exactly what you expect me to do, and 'B\", I don't think you'd crack anyway. (sits at table) No, all I want from you is to show me your hands. Right. Let me see if any of this rings a bell for you. You've been shaking uncontrollably, you vomited at least twice in the last 10 hours, and this morning you found hair on your pillow because it's starting to fall out.\nRYAN EASTWICK: What's wrong with me?\nPETER: Radiation poisoning. Right now, you're in the \"walking ghost\" phase, which I suggest you enjoy 'cause it's a hell of a lot better than the intestinal bleeding, delirium and coma phase you're gonna hit in a couple of days. You violated the laws of physics, Mr. Eastwick, and Mother Nature's a bitch.\nRYAN EASTWICK: (puts jittery hands on table) Are you a doctor?\nPETER: First, I need to know what you were hired to steal.\nRYAN EASTWICK: He didn't tell us.\nPETER: Who's he? I need a name.\nRYAN EASTWICK: He never told us his name, alright? We were freelance, hired out. He equipped us, trained us. I can tell you names of the others, but it doesn't matter anyway. He's got everything he needs now.\nPETER: Everything he needs to do what?\nRYAN EASTWICK: Are you gonna help me or not?\nPETER: Actually, Ryan - no. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go on the other side of that glass and I'm gonna watch you bleed out, unless you tell me everything I need to know!\nRYAN EASTWICK: I swear, I don't know what he's doing. All I know is that I overheard a phone conversation once. He's going to a field in Westford.\nPETER: A field. What field?\nRYAN EASTWICK: I don't know! Look, man, you got to help me, alright? I need some medicine, okay? Some specialist. Please. You got to help me. Hey! Hey! (Peter walks out)\n(in the office bullpen)\nOLIVIA: (looking at map) There. Westford.\nCHARLIE: That's 30 square miles. How are we gonna find one field in all of that?\nOLIVIA: Wait.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: I know where they're going. There's an abandoned air strip out there. It's called Little Hill Field. \"Little Hill\". That's the codeword that Joseph Smith gave to David Robert Jones, in a case a few weeks ago.\nCHARLIE: The guy from the German prison?\nOLIVIA: It can't be a coincidence, Charlie. It's in Westford just off Route Three. You come in from the west. I'll take the south.\nCHARLIE: (to all in earshot) Alright - listen up! I need every available unit for field assist! Let's move, move, move!\nWALTER: (flipping through his lab records) I\u2019ve seen it here somewhere, what I hid in those banks\u2026 it must be \u2013 I kept very thorough records.\nPETER: Unfortunately not very organized records. (sits and fiddles with coin)\nWALTER: That\u2019s quite impressive.\nPETER: It\u2019s a nervous tick. Which hand? (makes coin disappear)\nWALTER: That\u2019s fantastic.\nPETER: Magic. (shrugs) What?\nWALTER: (stares) You nearly died when you were a boy. You started bruising\u2026 and your kidneys failed. The doctors didn\u2019t know what it was \u2013 the closest diagnosis was hepea \u2013 the rare form of bird flu that hadn\u2019t been around for decades. Your mother was beside herself, she stopped eating \u2013 she stopped sleeping\u2026 and I was worse. After all, I was the scientist, here my only son was dying and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\nPETER: Walter. I don\u2019t remember any of that.\nWALTER: I became consumed \u2013 with saving you. Conquering the disease. In my research I discovered a Doctor\u2026 Alfred Gross! Swiss. Brilliant physician. The only man that ever successfully cured hepea. But there was a problem. He had died in 1936. And so, I designed a device intend to reach back in to time \u2013 to cross the time-space continuum and retrieve Alfred Gross. To bring him back with me\u2026 to fix you, my dying son. The device Peter, I think that\u2019s what I hid in those safe deposit boxes.\nPETER: And it worked? You were able to go back to 1936 and get this guy?\nWALTER: No. Before I could test it, you started to recover. The doctor said it was a miracle. But the science behind it, in theory, it would work. In theory, it could retrieve anyone from anywhere.\n(driving quickly, getting instructions from her navigation system to \"...continue North on Plain Street... go 1.2 miles)\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: It\u2019s Charlie. I\u2019m headed East on Route Three, about 2 miles out. What\u2019s your 20?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m 10 minutes out, coming in from the South on Plain.\nMITCHELL LOEB: (calibrating the equipment by radio) 49.1.1122, 95 degrees North. 8.916092 degrees East.\nSURVEYOR 3: (on radio) Horizontal angle 33.33 grad. We\u2019re good to go.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Alright. What time do you have?\nSURVEYOR 2: Twelve-thirty\nKOHL: Mister Jones.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Mister Kohl.\nKOHL: I have your appeal request all prepared and ready to go. (turns back to Jones) All I need is your signature. (neck is snapped by Jones)\nRADIO: 10-82, this is Bravo Team entering Westford, pulling South on to Bridge Street.\nOLIVIA: \u2026just came out of nowhere.\nCHARLIE: Where are you? Give me your 20. Liv?\n(Olivia flees her vehicle when cut-off)\nDUNHAM: (tasered in back) Ughh.\nASSAILANT: Target captured.\n(Loeb and his team finalize preparations to extract Jones - Jones prepares for his elaborate escape from imprisonment - seconds later in a flash of light - Jones arrives at Little Hill)\nNINA: (on the phone from a London sidewalk) Hello.\nBROYLES: (on the phone from his office) Olivia Dunham is missing.\nNINA: What?... What do you mean missing?\nBROYLES: It appears she has been abducted. \u2013 Need I even ask? (she hesitates to reply) Are you there?\nNINA: Yes. Yes. I am here\u2026 Frankly I resent the accusation.\nBROYLES: I don\u2019t make accusations, so let me be clear. If I find out --\nNINA: -- Phillip! That\u2019s enough. Now you know how I feel about Agent Dunham. Why would I want any harm to come to her? Now, what do we know about who may have taken her? \u2013 And why?\nMITCHELL LOEB: (greeting Jones as he clears the field) So, what does one say at a moment like this? Nice trip?\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: I suppose that works well enough. I need to get into the decompression chamber.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Of course.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Do you have her? Agent Dunham.\nMITCHELL LOEB: She didn\u2019t even put up a fight.\nDAVID ROBERT JONES: Well then, let\u2019s not keep her waiting."

As in L.S.D?\nWALTER: Well... it's a special blend.\nPETER: I see. Hey, guess what just happened.\nWALTER: Hmmm?\nPETER: Finding out that my father is giving drugs to bugs - somehow just became a typical moment in my life.\nWALTER: It's wonderful. Isn't it?\nASTRID: (walking-in) Hey, have you heard from Olivia this morning?\nPETER: No. Why? What's up?\nASTRID: She's missing.\n(regaining her senses as she is strapped to a gurney and rolled in by two technicians- a masked man approaches and prepares medical equipment)\nMITCHELL LOEB: (mumbles)\nOLIVIA: Who are you? ... What do you want?\nMITCHELL LOEB: This won't take long.\nOLIVIA: I'm sure you say that to all the girls.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Turn her over.\nOLIVIA: (flipped in-place) WHOA!!\nBROYLES: (pacing the crowded situation room) Listen-up! One of our own has been abducted. The vehicle of Agent Olivia Dunham was found abandoned on Graniteville Road in Westford, three miles North-East of Little Hill. I want everyone doing everything... surveillance cameras checked, local officers and agents questioned, anyone who might have seen anything. P.D., D.W.P, Triple A. I don't care what acronym it is... you get'em, you talk to them and you find Dunham. For those of you new to this office... this is Agent Charlie Francis - he's my 'second-in-command'. You got anything, you come to me or him.\nMITCHELL LOEB: (To Olivia) Try not to move.\n(Loeb walks to another room.)\nMAN #3: Sir, did it work?\nMITCHELL LOEB: I hope so. Get my car ready. I'm going back to the office.\nMAN #3: Yes, sir.\nOLIVIA: Can I please have some water? If you're going to kill me, then can I please have some water? Please.\n(First unidentified attendant looks toward second unidentified attendant. They agree. the first brings a beaker of water to Olivia.)\nOLIVIA: I need to-- I need to sit up. Please. Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you.\n(Olivia smashes beaker into first attendant's face and throws a pair of scissors at second attendant. After freeing herself in the confusion, she disables or kills both attendants. In another room, knocks out a third man and takes some laboratory samples after placing them into a thermos. She takes a weapon, a remote key device and a cell phone. On her way out of the building, Olivia entounter a fourth man, whom she shoots.)\nBROYLES: (On cell phone) And pull agents from Albany, Mr. Clark, and get them to Boston, or do I need to remind you how I started this conversation?\nUNIDENTIFIED WORKER: I have a Sanford Harris, line six.\nBROYLES: (On cell phone) Just get it done. (Switches phones.)\nSANFORD HARRIS: Sanford.\nBROYLES: Listen, we, uh-- We're having something of a crisis here.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Yeah, well, your crisis is why I'm calling. Look, Phillip, we go back too far. I say something diplomatic, you'll see through it before the end of my sentence.\nBROYLES: You're calling about Olivia Dunham?\nSANFORD HARRIS: I'm calling about \"Fringe Division.\" Internal affairs is sending me in to do a full review of your office, make sure things are running as they should. I just wanted you to hear it from me.\nOLIVIA (on cell phone): This is Agent Dunham. I need to speak to Broyles.\nBROYLES: What the hell happened to you?\nOLIVIA: I'm in Watertown. There was a building that we need to raid. I need agents, maybe 20. Have them meet me in 30 minutes At the end of Talcott Street.\nBROYLES: Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Not yet, I'm not.\nOLIVIA (to agents arriving on scene): The building I was being held at is two miles--\nROGUE AGENT (pointing a gun): Hands behind your head and drop to the floor.\nOLIVIA: Where's Broyles?\nROGUE AGENT: Do it!\nOLIVIA: What's going on here?\nROGUE AGENT: Freeze right there!\nSANFORD HARRIS: Quite a day, Agent Dunham. You're in Boston hospital. You probably didn't think you'd see me again so soon.\nOLIVIA: Don't take this the wrong way, Mr. Harris, but, uh, I don't think about you all too often.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Really? Well, you must get some satisfaction from what you did to me. My conviction wasn't a point of pride for you?\nOLIVIA: Why am I cuffed to the bed?\nSANFORD HARRIS: Because this is the kind of authority that I have here. You see, my conviction on sexual assault that you so ably prosecuted was overturned. And Homeland Security, for whom I consult, has assigned me to review \"Fringe Division.\"\nOLIVIA: Just like that?\nSANFORD HARRIS: Which gives me the prerogative to question your sanity, your loyalty, your worthiness to serve. And it seems to me the people you surround yourself with have failed those tests at every turn. Beginning with your former partner... and lover, John Scott.\nOLIVIA: John!\nSANFORD HARRIS: An agent who betrayed you and who turned out to be a traitor against this country, a traitor whose life you went to considerable lengths to save.\nOLIVIA: If you're suggesting that I know anything about--\nSANFORD HARRIS: You went to Iraq to recruit a man to help you save Agent Scott's life. Peter Bishop, arrested seven times.\nOLIVIA: I needed Peter.\nSANFORD HARRIS: To assist you in freeing his father from a mental institution. Walter Bishop, who was sent to St. Claire's because he was deemed unfit to stand trial for manslaughter, a man who spent most of his adult years running questionable scientific experiments on human subjects. He's out of his mind, Miss Dunham. These are the people you surround yourself with. A traitor, a criminal, and a lunatic. What does that say about you?\nOLIVIA: Am I under arrest?\nSANFORD HARRIS: It goes without saying that you are not to investigate your own abduction. Understood? (Tosses handcuff onto Olivia's bed and leaves)\nCHARLIE: Liv. Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Yep.\nCHARLIE: Hey, Liv, you know I had nothing to do with the way you were taken in, right?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I know that. That son of a bitch Harris, he molested three women. I put him away, and that's what this is about. I am not gonna ask him for a thing. I'm gonna go to that building myself.\nCHARLIE: We sent a team to the address, to the building where you were being held. It was empty. There was nothing there.\nOLIVIA: What about the phone I got? The car I took? Did you trace...\nCHARLIE: They're clean. The only prints were you. Oh, there's something else. There's a woman here to see you-- Rachel. She says that you're expecting her. Who is she?\nOLIVIA: She's my sister.\nRACHEL: How are you?\nOLIVIA: Oh, oh, you look great.\nRACHEL: I don't really.\nOLIVIA: Come on, you do.\nRACHEL: I don't.\nOLIVIA: You're always so hard on yourself.\nRACHEL: I know, whatever. Thank you.\nOLIVIA: You are just a giant person.\nELLA: Hey, Aunt Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Hello. When did you get so big?\nRACHEL: What happened to your face?\nOLIVIA: Oh, it's, um, a scratch.\nELLA: I brought this for you.\nRACHEL: She wanted to bring you something from her room.\nOLIVIA: I have really, really needed one of these. Thank you so much.\nRACHEL: Are you sure you're alright?\nOLIVIA: It's a long story. I, uh-- I'm working on a case.\nRACHEL: Go, go, we're good. Is it okay if we still stay with you tonight? 'cause if it's not okay--\nOLIVIA: yeah, yeah. No, of course. I'll meet you back here at 5:00.\nRACHEL: Perfect. go, save the world.\nOLIVIA: Alright.\nRACHEL: I love you.\nOLIVIA: I'll see you at 5:00.\nRACHEL: Thank you so much.\nOLIVIA: Mwah. bye.\nOLIVIA: (On cell phone) Peter, it's me.\nPETER: Olivia, thank god. Are you okay? how are you? Where are you?\nOLIVIA: I'm on my way to you. So can you meet me outside in ten minutes? And bring your father. I think we'll need him.\nPETER: Do I have to?\n(Olivia picks up Peter and Walter; they load several metal cases into Olivia's vehicle.)\nOLIVIA: They gave me a spinal tap. They put electrodes or sensors on my head. Why would they do that? I mean, what would they want with me? What were they doing? Who could they be?\nWALTER: You're like the question machine.\nPETER: And there was nothing there when they checked the building?\nOLIVIA: No. They'd cleared the building. But I took something before I left, something from one of their labs, and I hid it to keep it safe.\nPETER: What was it?\n(Olivia pulls into the vacant lot where she had buried the thermos. She unearths it, opens it, and hands the tubes to Walter. Several minutes are presumed to have passed. Walter has set up a small laboratory in the back of Olivia's vehicle and is looking at a specimen through a microscope.)\nOLIVIA: Walter, can you identify what it is?\nWALTER: Yes. I'm afraid I can.\nMILES KINBERG: Which means if your high school Bio teacher told you that humans sit at the top of the food chain, he or she was dead wrong. Literally millions and millions of organisms feed on us, reproduce within us. Viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi -- the four musketeers of the pathogenic world.\n(Kinberg stops speaking, grasps the podium, and falls to the floor.)\nTARA COLEMAN: Doctor Kinberg? Doctor Kinberg? Somebody call an ambulance. Someone help him. Somebody help him.\n(Coleman administers artificial respiration to Kinberg to no avail. He dies. His throat bulges and a slug approximately one foot long exits his body through his mouth.)\nBROYLES: (voiceover) Agent Dunham, I know you've already had quite a day, but there is an event that requires our attention.\nOLIVIA: (voiceover) Okay, where?\nWALTER: Internal hemorrhaging. Rapid cell deterioration. It appears that he suffocated from within.\nPETER: Well, maybe that's 'cause a giant, slimy, spikey slug came out of his mouth.\nWALTER: Yes. And I have a theory as to what it might have been.\nPETER: I'm sure you do. Care to share?\nWALTER: Eventually.\nOLIVIA: Peter, anything?\nPETER: No, it always takes a second for the thermal cameras to calibrate. What do we know about our guy?\nOLIVIA: Only what I was told outside. His name's Miles Kinberg, immunologist, cutting edge work, an expert in his field. That's all I know.\nWALTER: Whatever it was, it ripped through his esophagus on the way out. At least he died teaching, a righteous profession.\nPETER: Hold on a sec. I got it.\nOLIVIA: Stay there.\nPETER: Right there. Right there, right there.\nWALTER: (wandering the room oblivious, looking at the lecture slides) Look. Simian hemorrhagic fever. The infected cells have a definitive spiderweb look. Makes HIV look like a common cold by comparison.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: Ebola. First the headaches then the skin turns to rice pudding.\nPETER: Walter, please.\nWALTER: No time for the immune response.\nPETER: I lost it.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean you lost it?\nPETER: Either it can vanish or it's fast. It's really fast. There.\nOLIVIA: Cover the doors!\nPETER: It's going down. There! Get it!\nOLIVIA: There! there!\nPETER: Get it, get it. get it.\n(Walter regains his focus and throws a wastebasket over the organism)\nWALTER: Things like this used to happen in the lab all the time. Makes me nostalgic.\nWALTER: Spirited - isn't it? (as the gigantic organism squirms around)\nPETER: Well, have you considered, I don't know, killing it?\nWALTER: We can always kill it, son. We can't always bring it back.\nASTRID: You probably could.\nWALTER: That is true. Do you know what I could go for?\nASTRID: Don't say food.\nWALTER: Cheese steak.\nASTRID: How can he even think about eating?\nPETER: I know. it's disgusting, right? And yet...\nASTRID: Ha, you want one too?\nPETER: Extra provolone, please.\nASTRID: Like father like son.\nPETER: Ah, come on, don't say that.\nWALTER: (studies the microscope) My theory is correct. I knew it. This organism was developed from the same material that Olivia stole from her captors. We must let her know.\nPETER: You sure?\nWALTER: My boy, I'm not even sure that we all exist on the same plane of consciousness. But yes, I believe so.\nBROYLES: I've been briefed on how you brought in Olivia Dunham.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Oh, I had reason to suspect she might be dangerous.\nBROYLES: I agreed to let you question her, not tranq her like a rabid dog. What you did was unacceptable. Dunham's been nothing but an exemplary agent, and this is my office.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Well, then you need to be corrected on two counts. The jury's out on Dunham. I'm not convinced she's the superstar you claim she is.\nBROYLES: How could you be? You're on a vendetta against her.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Secondly, while I'm here on active investigation, this division is under my purview.\nBROYLES: Active investigation? This morning it was a review.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Well, the Pentagon is concerned, Phillip. Well, think of how this office was thrown together. Flight 627 lands, and suddenly you're in charge of two dozen agents?\nBROYLES: Somehow I think none of that's the reason you're here.\nSANFORD HARRIS: This isn't a witch hunt. I'm not here to punish some J.V. agent who tried to ruin my life for chasing a little tail. I'm here to do my job. Why don't you do the same?\nOLIVIA: Did you see anyone unusual? Anyone in your class?\nTARA COLEMAN: No.\nOLIVIA: And did he mention anything to you? Anything in private?\nTARA COLEMAN: Why would he?\nOLIVIA: 'cause you were his teacher's assistant.\nTARA COLEMAN: Oh.\nOLIVIA: I thought that he might have mentioned if something unusual had happened.\nTARA COLEMAN: No, he didn't. Nothing.\nOLIVIA: We've been trying to track Kinberg's whereabouts over the past week. We spoke to his wife, and she said that he had arrived home just before midnight the last two nights, but, according to his schedule, his last class started at 6 o'clock.\nTARA COLEMAN: He's had extended office hours this week.\nOLIVIA: Well, could I get a list of the students he talked to?\nTARA COLEMAN: It was drop-in. I'm not really sure. I'm sorry. After what happened today, I feel like nothing's real. That was crazy... it was--\nOLIVIA: How long were you seeing him? Professor Kinberg.\nTARA COLEMAN: Three months. I knew he was gonna take the job. He hadn't even told his wife about it yet.\nOLIVIA: What job was that?\nTARA COLEMAN: I shouldn't. He wasn't supposed to tell me.\nOLIVIA: It's okay.\nTARA COLEMAN: The CDC - Centers for Disease Control. They offered him this big job, which meant moving to Atlanta. So I figured that was gonna be it for us.\nOLIVIA: And what exactly was the job?\nTARA COLEMAN: Task Force to oversee the country's preparedness to fight off an epidemic. It sounded like a big deal.\nOLIVIA: Can I come in?\nBROYLES: I hate that-- knocking and asking while you're coming in.\nOLIVIA: Doctor Kinberg - the professor who died at Boston College, was offered a job at the CDC to co-chair a classified task force whose sole responsibility was to respond to epidemics.\nBROYLES: And?\nOLIVIA: He wasn't the only scientist asked. There was another one -- Doctor Russell Simon from Cambridge. I'm trying to locate him now.\nBROYLES: What, you think he's a target too?\nOLIVIA: I do. And I also think that the people who killed Kinberg are the same people who took me.\nBROYLES: And how'd you make that leap?\nOLIVIA: Walter, he thinks the thing that killed Doctor Kinberg is genetically similar to some evidence that I grabbed from the people who abducted me.\nBROYLES: But why abduct you? What's the link? And why kill Kinberg like that?\nOLIVIA: I don't know yet. But so far I figured why kill an epidemiologist unless you're looking to start an epidemic?\nBROYLES: Get rid of the firefighter before you start a fire. And why am I just now hearing of this?\nOLIVIA: Because your friend Sanford Harris forbade me from investigating my own abduction.\nBROYLES: Harris. He's put everything on hold... has requested that I run all operations past him before we move.\nOLIVIA: Is that even possible?\nBROYLES: Apparently.\nOLIVIA: Sir, I'm asking you to save a man's life. Are you telling me that you don't have the authority to let me do my job?\nBROYLES: Find Simon. Get him in protective custody now.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nBROYLES: I'll handle Harris.\nOLIVIA: I know you will. (smiles)\n(on her cell phone with her sister)\nOLIVIA: Hey, Rach, it's me. Can we just meet at the apartment? Is that okay?\nRACHEL: Yeah, sure. I have the key. Is everything okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I'm fine. (picks up her Magic Eight Ball) I won't be too late. And if you get hungry, there's food in the fridge, or there are some menus by the phone in the kitchen if you want to order in.\nRACHEL: Don't worry about us at all. Ella's having a blast.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'll see you tonight. I love you.\nRACHEL: You too.\n(hangs-up, turns to talk to Charlie)\nOLIVIA: I'm going to Cambridge to pick up Russell Simon.\nCHARLIE: Who's that?\nOLIVIA: A man we're taking into protective custody. I'll give you the details on the way.\nCHARLIE: Oh, I'm going with you?\nOLIVIA: Yeah\nCHARLIE: Meet you downstairs. (leaves the area)\nOLIVIA: Hey, Mitch.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Listen, Olivia, your abduction. I'm gonna coordinate the investigation. I assume everything you remember is already in your debrief.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nMITCHELL LOEB: If I find anything, I'll let you know. We'll find 'em.\nOLIVIA: That's great, Mitch. Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (walking through the situation room) Doctor Simon, thank you for your cooperation.\nRUSSELL SIMON: I suppose I should be thanking you. FBI tells you they're here to save your life, you listen.\nOLIVIA: Well, I know it must seem confusing.\nRUSSELL SIMON: Well, it's certainly shocking. Miles was a dear friend.\nOLIVIA: I am sorry.\nCHARLIE: (in a private briefing area) Know that we're doing everything we can to bring those responsible to justice.\nRUSSELL SIMON: The C.D.C. wasn't expecting me for three months.\nCHARLIE: Who else knew you were planning on taking this job?\nRUSSELL SIMON: Well, no one. just my wife. I was instructed not to tell anyone.\nOLIVIA: And is there anyone you can think of who might be targeting you?\nRUSSELL SIMON: Maybe students whose grades they might have felt were undeserved.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (at the door) Will you excuse us for a moment? I need to talk to my agents.\nRUSSELL SIMON: Sure.\n(in the hallway)\nSANFORD HARRIS: (to Charlie) Can you give us a minute? (to Olivia) So I understand that you have requested placing Doctor Simon in protective custody.\nOLIVIA: I believe that his life may be in danger.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Yeah, well, that's taxpayer dollars, Miss Dunham, and I haven't approved that.\nOLIVIA: Let me ask you a question, not that I don't enjoy having you here, But how long are you planning on sticking around?\nSANFORD HARRIS: Until I have made a full assessment of how this office conducts its business. Did Broyles approve your request?\nOLIVIA: No, he did not. (he starts to walk off) Mr. Harris, you don't like me, you don't respect me, and you think I'm bad at my job... but please, don't let that get in the way of doing the right thing. That man in there may likely die if we don't keep him safe. I'm not asking you to like me. I'm asking you to do the right thing.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Yeah, we'll keep him safe.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(walking alone, she answers her cell phone)\nOLIVIA: This is Dunham.\nPETER: Walter's still trying to determine what that thing is that came out of Kinberg... but I think we made a breakthrough.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so what is it?\nPETER: It seems to be activated by a liquid.\nOLIVIA: What does? The parasite?\nPETER: The yellow powdery stuff in the vials that you stole, they're like eggs, but the catalyst is stomach acid.\nOLIVIA: So the victim just needs to ingest it?\nPETER: Exactly right, and then it grows--fast.\n(Simon accepts a glass of water from a visitor while he waits)\nRUSSELL SIMON: Thank you.\nMITCHELL LOEB: No problem.\n(continuing their phone conversation)\nOLIVIA: And is there any way to trace it, where it came from?\nPETER: Walter doesn't seem to think so, no.\n(Simon quenches his thirst as Charlie returns)\nCHARLIE: Doctor Simon, with your permission, I'd like to take you to our Field Office. We'll debrief you, go over your options. Then we'll move you to a safe house... You okay?\nRUSSELL SIMON: Yeah.\nCHARLIE: There'll be agents there on call 24 hours a day. (Simon convulses) Breathe.\nCHARLIE: (into the intercom) This is Agent Francis, I need medical attention in Room Six. (to Simon) I called medical assistance.\n(Simon collapses and regurgitates the gigantic organism)\nCHARLIE: (quietly) Oh, my god.\n(Olivia enters as the organism speeds around, Charlie fires at it once)\nWALTER: It's viral. Nasopharyngitis, albeit a gargantuan specimen.\nOLIVIA: What--what does that mean?\nWALTER: This organism is a single specimen of a virus for the common cold.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that this is one single cell?\nWALTER: It's not unprecedented. The ostrich egg is a single cell, and it can grow up to five pounds.\nPETER: They supersized the common cold, which, as it turns out, is disgusting.\nOLIVIA: Obviously somebody's playing with us.\nPETER: Yeah, they're showing off. Killing epidemiologists with the common cold.\nWALTER: It is impressive.\nPETER: What I want to know is what they wanted from you.\nOLIVIA: Oh, who cares about me? I want to know who's next.\nPETER: I care about you. If we can figure out why they needed you, then maybe we can figure out who's next.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna keep looking for someone who's connected to Kinberg and Simon. (departs the area)\nWALTER: She is beautiful, isn't she?\nPETER: Who?\nWALTER: The slug.\nRACHEL: (head in the refrigerator) You know, I could have cooked for you.\nOLIVIA: (at work over the stove) Uh, no, thanks. I've tasted your cooking.\nRACHEL: Hey, I've gotten really good, you know.\nOLIVIA: Oh, yeah?\nRACHEL: Yeah. No, I haven't.\nOLIVIA: I didn't think so.\nRACHEL: Hard day?\nOLIVIA: Uh, I honestly wouldn't know what to tell you. And if I did, it would be a felony.\nRACHEL: You have a crazy job.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I have a crazy job. Cheers.\nRACHEL: Cheers. (clink wine glasses)\nOLIVIA: Have you heard from Greg?\nRACHEL: (shakes her no, gets misty) I don't know how to do this alone.\nOLIVIA: Ella is beautiful, and smart, and strong, and she gets that from you.\nRACHEL: Me? no. You've always been the strong one, you have.\nOLIVIA: Rach.\nRACHEL: I've only done one thing right in my life.\nOLIVIA: Then you need to be strong for her. Whatever you need, I'm here. And you guys can stay here as long as you want.\nRACHEL: Thank you.\nOLIVIA: Is there something else? Something you're not telling me?\nRACHEL: No. No, there's nothing else.\nMITCHELL LOEB: (passing her at her desk) How goes it?\nOLIVIA: Horrible.\nMITCHELL LOEB: We'll find 'em, whoever's responsible for what happened. Maybe this'll help. (tosses her a Magic Eight Ball)\n(she drops it, reaches down to pick it up and notices his shoes are like her abductors)\nOLIVIA: (marches to Charlie's work-station) I need to talk to you. (quietly in an empty corridor) Charlie, I think I know who killed Simon. And I think it's the same person who abducted me.\nCHARLIE: Who?\nOLIVIA: Mitchell Loeb. Don't ask me how I know. I'll tell you later.\nCHARLIE: Livvy, that can't be right.\nOLIVIA: It is. And I can prove it. But I've got Harris watching me like a prison guard. I can't do this myself.\nCHARLIE: What do you need?\n(Olivia approaches the Loeb's house, knocks and looks around)\nPETER: Walter - is that LSD?\nWALTER: LSD, why would I?-- it's a decongestant. She is a giant cold virus after all.\nPETER: Right.\nCHARLIE: (enters the lab for a quiet conversation) Peter. You got a moment?\nPETER: What's up?\nCHARLIE: Olivia may have a lead on who abducted her. Only she can't pursue it without some help. I can't help her.\nPETER: Why not?\nCHARLIE: Suffice it to say that sometimes a problem with being in law enforcement is that you gotta obey the law yourself.\nPETER: And you think I'm the guy to break the law for you?\nCHARLIE: I'm sorry, I didn't--\nPETER: No, look, you're right. I am the guy to break the law for you. What do we need?\nCHARLIE: I need a wiretap.\nPETER: On who?\nCHARLIE: Mitchell Loeb... FBI.\n(Olivia returns to the front door and starts to pick the lock when Loeb appears from the side of the property)\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Hello?\nOLIVIA: Samantha.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Olivia, hi.\nOLIVIA: I was just in Marlborough. I thought I'd drop by and check to see if you're okay.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: I don't understand.\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I guess I hadn't talked to you since Mitchell's surgery.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Oh, well, how sweet of you. Would you like to come inside? Have a cup of tea?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, thank you.\n(fixing tea in the kitchen)\nOLIVIA: I've been thinking a lot about you and everything that you and Mitchell went through. It's really lovely having him back at the office.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Oh, yes, he's really glad to be back.\nOLIVIA: His recovery seemed to go smoothly.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: What were you doing in Marlborough?\nOLIVIA: I'm working on a case.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Well, what's the case?\nOLIVIA: Suspicion of a double agent.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: (the kettle whistles) Excuse me. I'll get the tea.\nOLIVIA: Mind if I use your bathroom?\nSAMANTHA LOEB: It's down the hall.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(on his cell phone in the lab)\nPETER: Kyle. Hey, man. (to Charlie) Can you grab me that phone? (points) (to Kyle) Alright, go ahead. (takes notes) Uh-huh, okay, so I enter the phone number and then just punch in that code? Kyle, you are the greatest, man. (listens) Have I told you that lately? (listens) Yeah, thanks. you too. (hangs-up)\nPETER: (to Charlie) He used to work at the phone company, but I never really understood why. The guy's a genius.\nCHARLIE: Yeah, right. Wouldn't want to waste any of that potential.\nPETER: (placing new call) He tapped into the Loebs' home phone number. We should be able to pick up any outgoing calls that make from their house.\n(Samantha Loeb dials out)\nMITCHELL LOEB: (answers phone at work) This is Mitchell.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Olivia Dunham is in our house.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Why?\nSAMANTHA LOEB: She claims she was here to check on you.\n(in the lab) CHARLIE: Is it working?\nPETER: No. Hey, Kyle, it's not working. All I'm getting is buzz. I don't hear anything.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: I think she knows.\nMITCHELL LOEB: I don't know how she could.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: I don't know what to do.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Well, I do. And you have to move fast.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: What?\nMITCHELL LOEB: You need to kill her. Right now.\n(Olivia snoops around the Loebs' home office and picks the lock on the desk)\nSAMANTHA LOEB: (on the phone) Her office might know that she's here. How can I just--\nMITCHELL LOEB: (in his office on the phone) Dunham's already under suspicion for being unstable. They think she's dangerous.\nPETER: (placing a call from the lab) Alright, I'll try it again.\n(Olivia finds pictures of the giant organisms in the desk)\n(Peter listens to the Loeb's on the wire tap)\nMITCHELL LOEB: We can say she came after you, that it was self-defense.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: There has to be another way to do this.\nMITCHELL LOEB: There isn't, Honey. There's one way. You cannot let Dunham leave there alive. In the entry closet, top shelf, in the back, there's a gun. Contact me when it's done.\nCHARLIE: (asking about the wire tap that Peter hears) What is it?\nPETER: Olivia's in trouble.\nCHARLIE: What happened?\nPETER: Hold on a second.\n(Samantha prepares to attack Olivia. Olivia closes the desk and answers her phone)\nPETER: Come on, pick up, pick up.\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) It's me.\nPETER: Get out of the house. she's gonna kill you.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: Samantha Loeb is going to kill you. Get out of the house right now.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: (stalking through the house with the pistol) Olivia. Tea's ready. Olivia?\nOLIVIA: Samantha. Turn around and put the gun on the ground. Put the gun down. (she drops it) Now get down on the ground. Samantha.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: Please, don't hurt me.\nOLIVIA: Get on the ground, Samantha.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: I was just doing\u2014\nOLIVIA: Samantha, get down on the ground now. I don't want to shoot you, but I will.\nSAMANTHA LOEB: (sobbing) What are you gonna do to me? Are you going to hurt me?\nOLIVIA: Damn it, Samantha, shut the hell up and get down on the ground. (Samatha tries to get closer) Don't do it. Please get down!\n(Dunham's pistol is knocked loose and they fight... after punching and tripping, the two separate and go for their weapons - both fire - Loeb falls with a wound to the forehead)\nOLIVIA: There's nothing here. Loeb knew he was gonna cut and run.\nBROYLES: Based on what you've found, you have nothing to trace.\nPETER: No, nothing yet.\nWALTER: I'll need more time to trace the origin of the virus, but even then it will be impossible to know the exact origin.\nCHARLIE: Liv, I hate to even ask you this. Anything you remember from when they had you?\nOLIVIA: No, there's nothing that I heard, nothing that I remember.\nBROYLES: There's no other way to track Loeb's cell phone?\nCHARLIE: Tech services tried everything.\nPETER: Wait a minute, not everything. The agents at Loeb's house, they're surveilling the area, right? No sign of Loeb?\nCHARLIE: Not yet.\nPETER: So he doesn't know about his wife.\nOLIVIA: No, he doesn't.\nPETER: Meaning that she could still contact him.\nBROYLES: I'm ahead of you. I'll get a team.\nWALTER: What happened? I missed it.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we need Samantha Loeb's cell phone. I think inventory has it.\nCHARLIE: I'm on it.\nOLIVIA: Nice work.\nPETER: Thanks.\n(driving quickly through town, Loeb receives a text message from his wife's cell phone and diverts to meet her. The science team waits in their vehicle)\nWALTER: It's all rather tense, isn't it?\nPETER: He's gonna come. Assuming, of course, they text each other.\nOLIVIA: (into her walkie-talkie) Do you see him yet?\nCHARLIE: (answers from his vehicle) No, not yet.\nWALTER: Peter was really worried about you when you were gone.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: You were.\nPETER: Well, of course I was worried.\nWALTER: He was really worried.\nCHARLIE: (into his walkie-talkie as Loeb drives up) We got him.\n(Loeb exits his vehicle for a pay phone)\nOLIVIA: (to the Bishops) Okay, you stay here.\n(vehicles swarm the scene and Loeb tries to flee)\nBROYLES: (as Loeb draws his pistol) Mitchell, put it down! put it down!\nOLIVIA: Freeze! (shoots Loeb as he turns to fire on her) Drop it. Drop your weapon.\n(Charlie collects the weapon)\nOLIVIA: You're under arrest.\n(Loeb gives her a smug smirk and she pistol whips him across the face)\nPETER: Nice work.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(in an interview room)\nOLIVIA: Who are you working for? Don't be an idiot, Loeb. This is your one chance to cooperate. I'd say to you that you have no idea how hard we're gonna come down on you, except you do.\nMITCHELL LOEB: I want to see my wife.\nOLIVIA: You're not getting a thing until you talk.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Then you're outta luck.\nOLIVIA: Why'd you kill them, Kinberg and Simon? And why like that? I mean, there are easier ways to take somebody out.\nMITCHELL LOEB: You're getting nothing.\n(in the observation room)\nSANFORD HARRIS: She can't do it. She won't get a confession.\nBROYLES: I'd say the evidence in his house is plenty.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Well, I'd say evidence is no confession.\n(in the interview room)\nMITCHELL LOEB: Ask as many questions as you want.\nOLIVIA: Why take me? And that spinal tap, what did you want? Loeb, this is your last chance to cooperate.\nMITCHELL LOEB: Or what, you'll torture me?\nOLIVIA: (to Charlie) Can you leave me alone with him?\n(in the observation room)\nSANFORD HARRIS: What's she doing?\n(in the interview room)\nOLIVIA: You want your wife, Mitch?\nMITCHELL LOEB: Yeah, Olivia, I do.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (contemplates) Okay. (shows him a picture of his dead wife) And do you want to know who pulled the trigger? Mitch? You're looking at her. Did you kill them? Did you?\nMITCHELL LOEB: Yes! Do you not understand the rules? What we're up against? Who the two sides are? Tell me at least you know that.\nOLIVIA: Who's we?\nMITCHELL LOEB: We had a plan here, lady. We had a shot. And you just blew it.\nOLIVIA: Then why did you kidnap me?\nMITCHELL LOEB: Kidnap you? Idiot. We saved you.\nOLIVIA: Saved me from what?\nMITCHELL LOEB: We were going to let you go. We saved you. You-- you have no idea --- what you've done. Not a clue.\n(in the observation room)\nPETER: There's your confession.\nBROYLES: You need to get some rest. I think you've earned it.\nOLIVIA: I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you.\nPETER: He's right. You should get home.\nOLIVIA: What did he mean he saved me? what the hell was that?\nPETER: He was messing with you. Well, I don't know. I mean, did you see him? There was something about the way he said that.\nPETER: The man's insane, Olivia.\nWALTER: I concur, and in the category of 'takes one to know one'... That man did seem disturbed.\nOLIVIA: But then why take me?\nPETER: Because they wanted to hurt you. They knew that you were investigating them. They wanted to take you out.\nOLIVIA: Then why not just kill me?\nPETER: You're talking about a man who infects people with giant viruses. If you hadn't escaped, who knows what they would have done to you. Listen to me, you'd just told him that you killed his wife. He said that to you to try and get a reaction out of you, to get to you. Let it go. You got his confession. Go home.\nWALTER: I was worried, too, when you were taken.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, Walter.\nWALTER: Not as much as him, of course.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: It's true.\n(Olivia and Ella are curled-up on a comfortable sofa taking a late afternoon nap. Rachel enters and tucks them under the blanket and gives each a kiss on the forehead... and turns off the reading lamp)"

(listens) You're wrong. (listens) Admit you're wrong. (listens) No, she didn't. (listens) What? (listens) Well,then she's a bigger idiot than you are, which is impossible. (listens) It is impossible. (listens) I'm really good at math. It's impossible. (listens) Alright, cool. Later. (stares at monitor)\nCYNTHIA WILES: (stand behind her son at his door) We'll be back around 10:00. Make sure to take Bucky out. You hear me? I love you. (leaves room)\n(the girls hang-out playing a popular board game. the buzzer loudly zaps Ella)\nELLA: (skiddish ang giggling) That scared me.\nOLIVIA: Me too.\nELLA: Your turn.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nRACHEL: Ella, when you said you brushed your teeth. Did you also completely dry your toothbrush?\nELLA: I brushed.\nRACHEL: Ella. (hands the child her toothbrush as she exits the room. then to Olivia) I just love being lied to.\nOLIVIA: Hey, you're a tough mother. Ella's a sweetheart.\nRACHEL: She is a sweetheart. She's a lying little sweetheart. Sure reminds me of you?\nOLIVIA: (laughing) Oh!\nRACHEL: I'm gonna go make sure she's brushing her teeth.\nWALTER: With all due respect, Darwin got it all wrong. I used to make the joke that Darwin's thinking was rather... unevolved.\nPETER: Which I'm sure used to be very funny.\nWALTER: For a brilliant man, Darwin was occasionally a moron. He claimed that males tried to spread their genes by having sex constantly. However, the females, with limited eggs, were more selective in their attempts to find genetically superior males. I believe that Darwin was simply inaccurate, that females can be just as aggressive as males, and with males equally dispassionate. Thoughts! (Peter reads a letter disconcerting letter) Peter?\nASTRID: (answers her cell phone) This is Astrid.\nOLIVIA: (driving) Hey, it's me. Can you have the guys go outside? I'm sending over a body.\nASTRID: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have them waiting outside.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nASTRID: Okay. (to Walter and Peter) Hey, that was Olivia. She needs you guys outside. A coroner's on his way with a body.\nWALTER: You know, this is the part of day that I look forward to most... when I know there's something bizarre out there. I just don't know what it is - like a grab bag of disturbing events, don't you think?\nPETER: Yeah. (somberly distracted, he discards the note in the garbage pail)\nWALTER: Be right back Agent Farnsworth.\nASTRID: Okay. Bye. (concerned, she retrieves and reads the note that Peter discarded)\nOLIVIA: (seated in their living room) Thank you for taking the time. We know you're grieving. We're very sorry about your loss.\nPAUL WILES: What the hell could have done that to him?\nCHARLIE: We don't know yet. But we are going to find that out.\nOLIVIA: Did you notice anything strange in your son's behavior over the last few days?\nCYNTHIA WILES: No. School is good. He was looking forward to graduating. We had dinner together almost every night. We tried to get a few syllables out about his day.\nCHARLIE: Any history of drug use?\nPAUL WILES: No. I know all parents think that, but in Greg's case, it's true. Whatever happened... he didn't bring it on himself.\nOLIVIA: What about any... preexisting medical conditions?\nCYNTHIA WILES: Asthma. I blame it for all the time he spends on the computer.\nOLIVIA: Was he on the computer last night?\nCYNTHIA WILES: Most nights. He spends all his free time there, playing games, trading songs. He chats about girls with his friends.\nCHARLIE: Which friends?\nPAUL WILES: Uh... Luke, probably. Luke Dempsey.\nCHARLIE: E-Y?\nPAUL WILES: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: We're gonna do everything we can to find out what happened to your son.\nWALTER: (after running a power drill into the skull of the corpse) He can be rotated onto his back now, drain the remainder of his brain. Once that's done, we can examine his cranial cavity.\nPETER: (approaches pessimistically) Oh, this is gonna be awesome.\nOLIVIA: (just arriving. on her cell phone) Just get me everything you can and call me right back. Thanks.\nPETER: Everything okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, his parents say he was a good kid. What do we know from the autopsy?\nWALTER: All I know for sure is that his brain matter has been completely liquefied. How? My first thought is an extremely virulent form of syphilis.\nOLIVIA: You're saying that his brain could have been cooked by an S.T.D.?\nWALTER: Safe sex is important. You do always have your sexual partners wear a condom, I hope.\nPETER: Walter...\nOLIVIA: Well, if he got this from a girl or some kind of drug that he was experimenting with, there may be a record of that on his computer. Astrid, can you check his hard drive? I had it transferred with some of his other effects.\nASTRID: I got it right here. I'm on it.\nWALTER: Oh, and be sure to check his floppy disks as well.\nPETER: Floppy disks are a little outdated. Why don't you focus on what you do best? All yours... liquid brains. (holds-up a beaker full of brains)\nWALTER: Oh. Fantastic. I will get the bone saw!\nASTRID: (studies her monitor) Hey - check this out!\nOLIVIA: What?\nASTRID: Something's wrong. The hard drive platters must be fused.\nOLIVIA: You sure?\nASTRID: Linguistics major. Computer science minor. Plus, I've been taking computers apart since I was, like, six.\nOLIVIA: So do you think you can get anything off this?\nASTRID: Uh... I know some pretty aggressive data retrieval techniques. I can give it a shot.\nOLIVIA: Well, I'm gonna go interview that Dempsey kid and see if I can dig up something else on the victims. So call me as soon as you find something.\nOLIVIA: (to a mechanic outside a large garage) Excuse me. I'm looking for Luke Dempsey... (he points to a busy bay) Thank you. (she enters the garage) Luke Dempsey? Olivia Dunham. F.B.I. Can I have a word?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: I was just talking with Greg last night. What happened to him?\nOLIVIA: To be honest, we're not entirely sure. What did you two talk about?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: A bunch of stuff. I got him a deal on a split rear exhaust for his '93 GT... told him he could swing by whenever. And after... a couple hours, he just... he stopped answering. I figured he fell asleep.\nOLIVIA: How do the two of you know each other?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Our dads worked together when we were kids... Greg and I stayed friends.\nOLIVIA: Can you think of anyone who may have wanted to hurt Greg... or maybe had a grudge against him?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: You think... somebody killed him?\nOLIVIA: Do you? (after the interview. answers her cell phone) Dunham.\nPETER: It's Peter. We just got a call about another body.\n(the science team arrives and is escorted through the lot by Broyles)\nOLIVIA: Sir.\nBROYLES: Dunham. The General Manager of this dealership was found dead by an employee.\nOLIVIA: We have the employee?\nBROYLES: Yeah. Though he's having a hard time being coherent.\nOLIVIA: Well, what exactly happened?\nBROYLES: (greeting the men) Bishop. Doctor.\nWALTER: (kneeling over the corpse) It appears he died the same way as the teenager in Springfield. Prepare six vials, please.\nPETER: Yes, sir.\nOLIVIA: Where's the guy who found him?\nBROYLES: This way.\n- - away from the forensics inspection - -\nSALESMAN: Anton's a nice man. Honest guy. He has three kids.\nOLIVIA: When was the last time you saw him alive?\nSALESMAN: Last night. There's a bar we go to sometimes. Strip club. My wife doesn't know. Just... please don't judge me.\nOLIVIA: I'm not judging you.\n- - over the corpse - -\n(Walter jams a long swab through the victims nose and into his brain)\nPETER: Ohhh!! (to the violent intrusion)\nWALTER: What? He's dead. He can't feel this. (taking sample from body) I wonder if they sell cars here with those seats that warm your ass.\nPETER: Why don't you ask 'em?\nWALTER: Hmm? Maybe I will.\n- - interview continues - -\nOLIVIA: Anton's worked here as long as you have?\nSALESMAN: A little longer than that, actually. He's been here for three years.\nOLIVIA: And is there anyone you can think of that would want to hurt him?\nSALESMAN: Anton? No way. He's solid.\nOLIVIA: Can I take your card in case I need to ask you some more questions?\nSALESMAN: Yeah, sure, um... my cell's on there. And if you're ever interested in a new vehicle, we have next year's models in, so, um... now you are judging me.\nASTRID: (shows the innards of the hard drive) It's the weirdest thing. The fused platters we found on the car salesman's computer... they're fried just like the kid's.\nOLIVIA: Well, that can't be a coincidence.\nASTRID: I'm trying to recover as much data as possible. These platters are incredibly sensitive. A speck of dust is enough to make them unusable. But this?\nOLIVIA: It looks like someone took a blowtorch to them.\nASTRID: And from what I was able to pull so far, It looks like both the computers downloaded a huge file... 657 megabytes each right before they crashed.\nPETER: Where'd the file come from?\nASTRID: It's a miracle I was able to salvage this much. To figure that out, I'd need another couple days to access the ISP servers.\nOLIVIA: That's time that we don't have. (an old phone rings. no one seems to know where it is coming from) Is it you?\nPETER: uhnt-uh.\nWALTER: I haven't heard that sound for ages.\nASTRID: I think it's the phone.\nOLIVIA: (after spying an old wall-mounted phone across the lab) Who would have that number?\nASTRID: It must be on Harvard's system. I didn't even know it worked.\nPETER: (hikes across the room and answers) Hello? ... no there's nobody here by that name... (turns his back to Astrid) Yes, I'm sure... Sorry. I think you got the wrong number.\nOLIVIA: Who was it?\nPETER: Some... student looking for financial aid.\nASTRID: What are you doing?\nPETER: I think... I got a guy who can help us.\nOLIVIA: Who?\nPETER: You really wanna know?\nOLIVIA: Good point. Be careful with that, though, 'cause it's evidence.\nPETER: (walks away with the hard drives and tosses them in the air) Just kiddin'.\nOLIVIA: (to Astrid) Okay, I'm gonna go talk to Greg Wiles's friend, Luke Dempsey.\nASTRID: (calling her back as she starts to depart) Agent Dunham? I think I might know who's just on the phone.\n(Astrid shows Olivia the letter discarded earlier by Peter)\nPETER: (enters a simple store front in a modest neighborhood and heads to the counter with a plastic bag) How's it going, Akim?\nAKIM: Peter Bishop. Long time. Not long enough...\nPETER: Play nice. I come bearing gifts. (holds-up a rare golden coin)\nAKIM: My god. I can't believe you kept it. You could have sold this for a fortune.\nPETER: I kept it to remind me never to wager with anything that I couldn't bear to live without.\nAKIM: I can have it back?\nPETER: Sure. First... I'm gonna need some help.\n(they head to a work bench in the rear of the building)\nAKIM: What do you got?\nPETER: (takes two computer drives from his bag) Just before they fried, both of these drives downloaded the same program.\nAKIM: Very good. (sits at the work bench) And what are we looking for?\nPETER: I wanna know what it is and where it came from.\n(the monitors immediately fill with a cascade of data)\nSANFORD HARRIS: Agent Dunham. I hear Agent Broyles has you investigating the Bridgeport Automotive death. May I ask what exactly you're looking for?\nOLIVIA: I'll be cross-referencing the victim's medical records with the A.M.A. database, looking for anything that might connect him to the teenager and explain what happened here.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Medical records, A.M.A. database, liquefied brains. Come on, Dunham. This case clearly falls under the jurisdiction of the C.D.C.! Qualified, knowledgeable, scientists...\nOLIVIA: ...there was no known pathogen, no signs of a contagion...\nSANFORD HARRIS: ...who see these things every day!\nOLIVIA: With all due respect, Agent Harris, I have done my due diligence. I just got off the phone with my contact at the C.D.C., and they have seen nothing like it. (displays photos of the victims) But you tell me, does this look like a flu you've heard of where people's brains come out their ears?\nSANFORD HARRIS: No. No. This looks like yet another excuse to justify the allocation of F.B.I. resources to what's arguably become a rogue division inside a federal agency, operating, if not completely autonomously, then well outside the standard regulatory purview. I have news for you, Agent Dunham. I'm here to remedy that.\nOLIVIA: I'll consider myself warned.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Twelve hours. After that, I shut you down and put the case in what I believe will be considerably more capable hands.\nAKIM: Whoa.\nPETER: What's this?\nAKIM: It's particles scattered all over the internet. This thing must have been insanely complex. Integrated video, audio. I mean some of this isn't even computer code.\nPETER: Is that even possible?\nAKIM: Multiple parallel packet routing. Ten times the usual nodes. Whoever sent this is trying very hard to cover their tracks.\n(in her office Olivia's research begins to bear fruit)\nPETER: Akim, come on. You have no idea where this thing came from?\nAKIM: Nothing yet. There's too many paths. Wait a second. Okay, I... I can't tell you where it's originating, but I got a destination. This program's being downloaded right now, real time.\nPETER: Then that's the next target.\nAKIM: Neighborhood in Brighton, near Boston. It's close by.\nPETER: Brighton? Can you pull up the address?\nAKIM: Honing in. There. That's where it's going. (Olivia's address pops-up)\nPETER: Oh My God. (immediately calls Olivia in her office)\nOLIVIA: Dunham.\nPETER: Olivia, listen to me... just before they died, both the victims downloaded the same transmission, and it's happening again right now.\nOLIVIA: Where?\nPETER: Your apartment.\n(in Olivia's apartment, Ella starts to play on the computer)\n(Peter and Olivia rush to Olivia's apartment in their respective cars. Rachel whirs away in the kitchen, unaware that her phone is ringing. Ella plays and learns on a laptop computer in a nearby room)\nPETER: (on cell phone to Olivia) Hey, I just turned right onto Broadway. I should be there in five minutes.\nOLIVIA: Uh, look, Rachel's not picking up her cell...\nPETER: Then call the next door neighbor.\nOLIVIA: I don't know any of the neighbors. I haven't seen any of them for months.\nPETER: Then call Boston PD.\nOLIVIA: I already have.\n(in Olivia's apartment, Ella is about to start the malicious program)\nELLA: Mom!\nRACHEL: One minute, Ella.\n(entrancing images appear to Ella on the monitor. Rachel continues her kitchen chaos - oblivious to Ella's developing problem. The monitor seems to be reaching towards Ella's face. After screeching to a halt, sending several trash cans flying, Olivia bursts through the front door of her apartment with her gun drawn)\nRACHEL: (startled, she drops a bowl of food) Liv, what the hell are you doing?\nOLIVIA: Okay... is there someone else here?\nRACHEL: Of course not. It's just us.\nOLIVIA: Ella? Ella. Everything's gonna be okay. (as the child continues to stare at the monitor)\nPETER: (arriving on scene) You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Can you check out the back?\nPETER: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Ella! Ella. Ella. What's wrong? (to the befuddled child)\nRACHEL: (coming from the kitchen) Nothing is wrong, Olivia. She's just playing her game, right, Ell?\nOLIVIA: Ella! Ella...Ella... sweetie! Ella!\nELLA: (coming out of her trance) Aunt Liv? When did you get home?\n- - after things have calmed down- -\nCHARLIE: I don't understand. What happened?\nOLIVIA: There were flashes on the computer screen when I first came in, like bursts of images. I don't know. I can't explain it. It was like nothing I had ever seen before.\nCHARLIE: Images?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. And they affected Ella in some way, like she was hypnotized.\nCHARLIE: I'm gonna call Computer Forensics. They'll be here right away.\nPETER: (singing to Ella) Trot, trot to Boston, trot, trot to Lynn. Better watch out, or you might fall in!\nRACHEL: Do you do birthday parties too?\nPETER: Not so much, no. Though I have done my fair share of baby-sitting lately.\nRACHEL: Yeah, well, the way you are with Ella, it seems like you'd be really good... at a party.\nPETER: I'm not really familiar with the word. Maybe you can talk to your sister, she can give me the weekend off.\nRACHEL: My sister's not really the weekend off type. That was always more me.\nRACHEL: (to Olivia) Everything okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Ella, come here. (studies the childs eyes)\nRACHEL: What are you doing?\nOLIVIA: You need to get her checked out as soon as possible.\nRACHEL: What are you talking about? She's fine. Look at her.\nOLIVIA: I'm sure everything's fine.\nRACHEL: Liv, what is going on?\nELLA: (to Olivia) There was a hand. I remember. There was a hand coming out of the computer.\nRACHEL: (skeptically) Okay, uh... we're definitely cutting back on the sugar intake and... possibly our visits with Aunt Olivia. Come on, Sweetie.\nPETER: Hold on. Hold on a second. What kind of hand, Ella?\nELLA: Weird... Glowy... Scary.\nRACHEL: Ell, this isn't funny. Look at me. You know how I feel about lying.\nELLA: I'm not! It really happened!\nRACHEL: How?\nELLA: I don't know. I was playing with my game, and I saw this hand.\nRACHEL: Which game was it?\nELLA: My Ponies.\nRACHEL: I don't want you on that site again, okay? Promise?\n(Olivia looks at the laptop and notices that the webcam is on)\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: (looking at Olivia through the laptop webcam) That's right, Sweetheart. I'm the one you're looking for.\n(as he mocks loudly to himself, alarms to his warehouse activate)\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Who's there?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: It... it's just me, Dad. Somebody in here? I heard voices.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Talking to myself. What are you doin' here?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Thought I'd bring you some lunch.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Thanks. How are things at the body shop, Luke?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Fine. Have you found a job yet, Dad?\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Who says I'm looking for one?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: I went by your place. The mail was all piled up. Mrs. Greely said you haven't been home in over a week.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: She should mind her own business.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Have you been sleeping here, Dad?\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Luke... thanks for the food, but... I should be getting back to this.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: W... what is it that you're working on?\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: A new program. I don't wanna jinx it. I think it's gonna impress a lot of people.\nOLIVIA (on cell phone): Okay, love you. Bye.\nPETER: How's Ella doing?\nOLIVIA: Fine. The doctor says she's perfectly healthy. There's no sign of neurological damage. Nothing.\nPETER: That's excellent news.\nOLIVIA: Charlie's taking them back. He's gonna keep an eye on the apartment until I get there.\nPETER: Good.\nOLIVIA: If something had of happened to her...\nPETER: ...but it didn't. Don't torture yourself with hypotheticals. She's fine.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. This is gonna sound crazy but I think whoever's responsible was watching - through the computer.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: The light next to the camera was on, and Ella doesn't know how to use it.\nBROYLES: You think he was spying on you?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. Maybe he was trying to scare me. He knows about the investigation, and this is his sick way of telling me to back off.\nBROYLES: I suppose he could have broken into our network, learned you were investigating his case... which means maybe we can track him.\nOLIVIA: Well, we have Forensics on it as we speak.\nPETER: Also, I've got a... subcontractor that I've worked with before. He's trying to track down the origin of the data stream that was sent to Olivia's computer.\nBROYLES: And this... data stream, you think it may be connected to what killed those people?\nOLIVIA: The victim, Greg Wiles, was found in front of his computer too, and his hard drive was fused, just like the car salesman.\nBROYLES: A computer program that can...\nPETER: Kill people. Yeah, I know. But Walter's working on it right now back at the lab. But here's what I don't understand. If a person is responsible for those deaths, why are they killing? Have you found any connection between the victims?\nOLIVIA: Not yet.\nMIRIAM ROSENTHAL: (arriving home late in the afternoon) Mark?... Honey?... Can you help me with the groceries?... (checks her mail) John and Alice are coming over for dinner. You remember? ...thought I'd make a roast. (walks upstairs) Hey, Dow Jones. Are you alive in there? Mark? (she enters his office to find him slupped back in his chair - dead) Mark!?... (she screams in horror)\nPETER: It's amazing, isn't it? All these people, and they don't have a clue... how crazy it all really is. The world... everything.\nOLIVIA: If we do our job, they'll never have to. (answers cell phone) Olivia Dunham.\nCHARLIE: (from office) We've got another death. This one outside Chicago. This one is a day trader.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) It's happened again. (to Charlie) When are you going to start calling them murders?\nCHARLIE: When you find us a murderer.\nOLIVIA: Well, send me everything you can on the victim.\nCHARLIE: Will do.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\n(Peter recognizes that he is being observed and excuses himself)\nPETER: (to Olivia) I'll meet you inside, okay? (approaches the waiting woman as Olivia heads for the laboratory) Are you Jessica Warren?\nJESSICA WARREN: Yes.\nPETER: I'm Peter Bishop.\nJESSICA WARREN: (gruffly) I know.\nPETER: I read your letter. And I can understand, of course, why it is that you want to see my father. But it's not the right time. He's only been out of the institution for a couple of months. After 17 years...\nJESSICA WARREN: ...and three months, Mister Bishop... I know exactly how long it's been.\nPETER: I'm sure you do. I'm very sorry for what happened, Missus Warren. I wish this weren't the case, but nothing will bring your daughter back... not even talking to my father.\nJESSICA WARREN: I need to see him.\nPETER: To do what? To blame him for the accident?\nJESSICA WARREN: It's between me and your father.\nPETER: I'm sorry. It's not going to happen. (somberly walking away toward the lab)\nOLIVIA: Hey. (removes her winter clothing)\nASTRID: Hey... I'm glad Ella's okay.\nOLIVIA: Oh. Thank you.\nWALTER: Oh, Agent Dunham. I think I worked out how these deaths occurred. It's a complex combination... of visual and subsonic aural stimuli - ingeniously designed to amplify the electrical impulses of the brain, trapping it in an endless loop.\nOLIVIA: Walter?\nASTRID: It's like a computer virus that infects people.\nOLIVIA: I don't understand. Ella said she saw a hand coming out of the computer.\nWALTER: A hallucinatory effect of the stimuli, perhaps. I need to research further. (walks away)\nPETER: (enters the lab) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: Where's the latest victim?\nOLIVIA: Uh... just outside of Chicago.\nPETER: Any motive yet?\nOLIVIA: Not yet. Listen... I think I know who that woman was... outside.\nPETER: What do you think you know?\nOLIVIA: That she's the mother of the lab assistant... that was killed in the fire here almost twenty years ago. It's none of my business.\nPETER: Go ahead. What?\nOLIVIA: Does Walter know? That she wants to see him?\nPETER: Of course Walter doesn't know. He couldn't handle it.\nOLIVIA: I see.\nPETER: You think that he could? (sits down)\nOLIVIA: I don't know why, but I do.\nPETER: You really think it's a good idea... ... to put him through that?\nOLIVIA: Well, I was thinking that it's all unresolved. For him, for her, and I was thinking that it must be hard for her too, to come back here to the place where she lost her daughter.\nPETER: What's your point?\nOLIVIA: That you underestimate him, your father - and you shouldn't.\n(Peter leaves as Astrid enters with some papers)\nASTRID: Here is what Charlie was able to dig-up on the last victim.\nOLIVIA: (reads aloud) 'Mark Rosenthal. Forty-eight. Married'. (to Astrid) Any information on his next of kin?\nASTRID: It's sad, actually. He just got married last year to a... a Miriam Dempsey. I have her number here if you want it.\nOLIVIA: Did you say Dempsey?\nASTRID: Mm-hmm.\nOLIVIA: I interviewed a Luke Dempsey this morning. He was friends with the teenage victim Greg Wiles.\nASTRID: Uh... according to this background info, Miriam Dempsey is Luke's mother.\nOLIVIA: So that would make the last victim Luke's stepfather.\nASTRID: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: What are the chances of the same kid being connected to both victims?\nASTRID: Maybe Luke is a killer.\nOLIVIA: It's possible, but... he seemed genuinely upset when I told him his friend was dead. He did mention something else. He said that the reason he was friends with the victim was because their fathers worked together.\n- - in a separate part of the lab - -\nWALTER: Is everything alright? I heard you and Agent Dunham. From the tone, it sounded like you were having an argument.\nPETER: Everything's fine. I tried to expense a couple of Celtic tickets on the F.B.I.... she caught me.\nWALTER: Oh, I see. I hope she doesn't notice the $2,000 for the baboon seminal fluid I ordered. I hope I can recall why I ordered it.\nPETER: (to Olivia as she enters with the papers) What's up?\nOLIVIA: I think we have our suspect.\nPETER: Brian Dempsey.\nOLIVIA: He used to work for Paul Wiles.\nPETER: Greg's dad?\nOLIVIA: Exactly. He was Dempsey's boss until he fired Dempsey six years ago. According to Wiles, he was a programmer, way ahead of his time. Wiles said when he fired him, Brian threw a fit.\nASTRID: Yeah, and the victim outside Chicago was married to Dempsey's ex-wife. Really nasty divorce too.\nPETER: What about the car salesman?\nASTRID: Uh, we're still looking for that connection. But it looks like Dempsey's M.O. is to hurt people who screwed him over by going after their loved ones.\nOLIVIA (on cell phone): Charlie. Yeah. It's me. I need you to get to Brian Dempsey's house. Luke's father. I think he's our guy.\n(in the observation room)\nSANFORD HARRIS: Dunham, where's our suspect?\nOLIVIA: There was no sign of him at home. We picked up his son from work.\nSANFORD HARRIS: What's your plan?\nOLIVIA: We're waiting for the right moment.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Well, why wait? Just go in and break him.\nOLIVIA: I... I'm not sure that's the way to go.\nSANFORD HARRIS: You care to share your reasoning?\nOLIVIA: I think that Luke suspects there's something wrong with his father. If we go in heavy-handed, then... he could shut down or call a lawyer, and then... he won't tell us anything.\nSANFORD HARRIS: It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen.\nOLIVIA: I'm more than familiar with passive coercion.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Good. Then find his pressure points, put your little hands around him, and squeeze. That's an order.\nOLIVIA: (sarcastically) Every time that guy opens his mouth, I like him more and more.\nCHARLIE: (to Olivia) So?\nOLIVIA: Come on.\n(in the interview room)\nOLIVIA: Luke, this is Agent Francis. Where's your father?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: No idea.\nOLIVIA: (sits across the table from Luke) Tell me about him.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Uh, what do you wanna know?\nOLIVIA: (standing over Luke's shoulder) He had a pretty rough ride. Smart. Maybe a little too smart for his own good. Couldn't hold down a job, then he gets dumped by your mom. That couldn't have been easy.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: People don't understand him. They don't take the time.\nOLIVIA: When did you see him last?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Few weeks ago. We aren't really close.\nOLIVIA: Have you spoken to your mom recently? Do you know what happened to your stepfather?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: And, uh, I told you about Greg myself.\nOLIVIA: Come on, Luke. The only thing that these victims have in common, besides having their brains liquefied, was that they were all close to someone who pissed-off your father. This guy (shows photo of Mark Rosenthal) died because he married your mother.\n(Luke reacts)\nOLIVIA: And your friend Greg here, (shows photo of Greg) he died because his dad fired your dad.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: That's impossible!\nOLIVIA: The horror show in this picture was a friend of yours. You wanna cover it up now?\nLUKE DEMPSEY: No! I want a lawyer. D-don't I get a lawyer?\n(back in the observation room)\nPETER: Is it any consolation knowing you were right?\nOLIVIA: (to Charlie) Do me a favor. Wait five minutes, then release him.\nCHARLIE: What about Harris?\nOLIVIA: Screw him.\nCHARLIE: My thoughts exactly.\nPETER: Okay, come on. What did I miss?\nOLIVIA: Just trust me.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: (on phone) Yeah, I need a cab.\nOLIVIA: (to another agent) I need to hear that call. (Agent provides phone) Thank you.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: ...2 Braddock Street.\nCAB DISPATCHER: One person going to 1432 Braddock Street. I'll have a car there in ten minutes.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Ten minutes, right? Alright, thanks.\nOLIVIA: (after eavesdropping) He just called a cab. One guess where it's taking him.\nPETER: Oh, come on. He cannot possibly be that stupid.\nOLIVIA: He is nineteen.\nPETER: Good point.\nPETER: I don't underestimate my father, by the way. I understand him, sometimes more than I want to. Look, if I let him talk to that woman, she's just going to accuse him of killing her daughter, which is something that he didn't do.\nOLIVIA: (driving a discreet behind the cab Luke hailed) Then why not just let them meet?\nPETER: Whose side are you on anyway?\nOLIVIA: I know what it's like to live with something unresolved... that's all.\nPETER: Congratulations... you just described the entire planet.\nOLIVIA: This could provide closure for your father. He's had to live with the death of thiis woman. He was put away because of it. Who's to say that this wouldn't be a resolution for him?\nPETER: Yeah, if I didn't know better, I'd think you actually wanted the man to have a nervous breakdown!\nOLIVIA: Then maybe you don't know better, because I care for your father, too. And I believe that shielding him from the truth, from what's real, ultimately does him a disservice.\nPETER: What's real doesn't really seem to concern Walter. And what you said earlier about this being none of your business, that was right on the money.\n(pulls to the curb a half block away from where the cab dropped the suspect off)\nOLIVIA: Okay, you stay here.\nPETER: You are not going in there alone.\nOLIVIA: Just stay here and watch the entrance.\nPETER: Will you at least call for backup?\nOLIVIA: Harris wants me to screw this up. If I call for help, he's going to do whatever it takes to make me look bad.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (sees the empty interrogation room and marches into the Situation Room) Where the hell are Dunham and the kid?\nAGENT: I have no idea.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (to everyone in earshot) Hey! Trace the G.P.S. on Dunham's car. I want to know where she is now!\n(Olivia stalks toward the interior of the warehouse and overhears a heated discussion)\nLUKE DEMPSEY: W- Why the hell would you do that? He was a friend of mine!\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: He has a bad family, Luke. They were cruel people.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: You actually... you actually killed Greg from here? Now... how many more Dad? Who else, huh?\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: All they had to do was give me a chance, a fair shake, a chance to prove myself, but they thought they could just drop me to the curb like a piece of garbage. Son...\nLUKE DEMPSEY: No! No! So all this is supposed to fix that? I don't know who you are anymore, Dad! I used to look up to you. And now... you're pathetic.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: (an alarm sounds as Olivia approaches) Go! They're coming for me, not for you.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Dad...\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Go!\n(Olivia moves through the now darkened room with her weapon at the ready. Dempsey slips up behind her and aims his revolver at her head)\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Stay right where you are.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: (aims a pistol at Olivia) You ruined everything. People were gonna respect me... respect my work. Now my son hates me because of you. (puts a pistol to his chin too) But this is how it ends.\nOLIVIA: Okay...\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Stay back, or I'll kill you, too. It was their fault... all of them! I just wanted them to feel the pain that they made me feel.\nOLIVIA: Just put the gun down.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: Why should you care whether I live or die? Especially when you know what I've done.\nOLIVIA: Mister Dempsey look away from the screen.\nBRIAN DEMPSEY: (becoming entranced with the images on the monitor) No. I wanna see. I want to finally see... my creation.\n(a concerned Peter hurries into the building)\nLUKE DEMPSEY: (charging from the behind a storage wielding a thick pipe) Stop right there!\nPETER: Hey there, Luke.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Shut up. Leave my father alone.\nPETER: Luke, take it easy.\nLUKE DEMPSEY: Stay back!\n(a gunshot sounds in the other room. Peter and Luke run toward it)\nPETER: Dunham! You okay?\nOLIVIA: I'm okay. Luke... Luke...\n(Luke sees his father shot dead)\nLUKE DEMPSEY: What did you do to him?\nOLIVIA: No, I didn't... he went into a trance and he shot himself.\n(Luke runs outside is intercepted by a team of law enforcers)\nAGENT: Freeze!\nSANFORD HARRIS: Get on your knees, son. Get on your knees.\n(Peter and Olivia inside their car)\nPETER: I don't get it. He knew he was killing those people. Why would the kid protect a murderer like that?\nOLIVIA: Because it's his father.\nBROYLES: Sanford.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Interesting day. (enters Broyles office and closes the door)\nBROYLES: So I hear.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (makes himself comfortable on the couch) For the record... your agent disobeyed a direct order of mine, released Luke Dempsey, and then attempted to apprehend the suspect without backup.\nBROYLES: From what I can tell, Agent Dunham closed this case in spite of your obstructions.\nSANFORD HARRIS: She violated too many aspects of FBI protocol to even count!\nBROYLES: She I.D.-ed a murderer, contained a computer program that melts people's brains...\nSANFORD HARRIS: Listen to me, Phillip...\nBROYLES: No, you listen to me. What you're passing off as bureaucratic concern looks an awful lot like a personal vendetta, and if you push it I will stake my career on her behalf.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (stands toe-to-toe with Broyles) Are you threatening me, Phillip?\nBROYLES: You decide to go after Olivia Dunham, you're going after me, and all the red tape in the world won't protect you.\nSANFORD HARRIS: You sure you're up for this? I got alot of red tape, Phillip. (walks out)\nPETER: (walking into the lab) Walter, There's a woman here who wants to talk to you.\n(Jessica Warren is standing several yards away; her face is concealed by shadows.)\nWALTER: She pretty?\nPETER: She's right there. Now, look... if you need me, I'll be right here. If you need to end the conversation for any reason, you just say the word.\n(Walter approaches Jessica)\nJESSICA WARREN: My daughter's name was Carla Warren.\nWALTER: Oh,dear.\nJESSICA WARREN: Do you remember her?\nWALTER: Yes.\nJESSICA WARREN: I want to see you because... you were the last person to see my daughter alive, and...I've always wanted to ask... Was there anything else I could know? Anything,anything else...you could tell me about my daughter.\nWALTER: She was... a wonderful girl. What I remember... is her smile. She had a wonderful smile.\nWALTER: I miss Carla.\nJESSICA WARREN: Me,too. I miss her.\n(Walter embraces Jessica Warren.)\nWALTER: I'll tell you everything I remember about our time together.\nRACHEL: Part of me wants to ask you to explain what happened with Ella. But I'm not sure I'll feel safer if I know.\nOLIVIA: You wouldn't.\nRACHEL: How do you do it, Liv?\nELLA: I brushed.\nRACHEL: Fantastic. Say goodnight.\nOLIVIA: Okay, come here and give me a kiss...on the cheek.\nELLA: I tricked you.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Good night, sweetheart.\nELLA: Night.\n(Olivia answers her doorbell)\nPETER: Hi.\nOLIVIA: What's up?\nPETER: First of all, I've had a couple of drinks, but don't worry... I walked over.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: And, uh... I wanted to say that... I've never had him in my life... Walter. And now, thanks to your insane freak show of an operation, I do. Have him in my life. And I think that I was... I think that I was a little scared. And maybe if he... he talked to that woman... Whatever. I... I wanted to say that I'm sorry. You were right. Thank you.\nOLIVIA: You're welcome.\n(Peter sees Rachel behind Olivia)\nPETER: Hi.\nRACHEL: Hi.\nPETER: How's Ella doing?\nRACHEL: Good. Thanks. Liv. She wants you to tuck her in.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: So I'll see you tomorrow.\nOLIVIA: Yeah."

We will be coming through with headsets which are available for purchase for four dollars. And of course exact change is always appreciated.\n(Bowman writes in his notes about technology, avoiding capture, imperatives and dangerous... when his nose starts to bleed. the senior woman next to him offers advice)\nSENIOR WOMAN: You should put keys on your back.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Excuse me?\nSENIOR WOMAN: It's an old wive's tale to stop the bloody nose.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Yeah?\nSENIOR WOMAN: Actually, I tried it once. It doesn't work. It's all bull.\n(Bowman quickly finds the lavatory, checks his teeth, swabs his mouth, tests the swab in solution, and, disappointed with the results, hurries to find a flight attendant)\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, I need to talk to you.\nMELISSA: Yes, sir, I'll be with you in one moment.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: No, now! Please.\nMELISSA: (to the passenger she was serving) I'll be right back. (in the galley to Bowman) What's the problem?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I'm in trouble. There's something happening to me, that I don't have the time or permission to explain to you.\nMELISSA: What is it?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: You need to listen to me very carefully. I need you to go to the passengers, I need you to collect as many sedatives or tranquilizers as you can.\nMELISSA: Okay, sir, I need you to take a deep breath.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: This isn't a panic attack. This is real. We will die, all of us, if you don't do what I say.\nMALE ATTENDANT: Sir, a threat like that is in violation of FAA regulat...\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Do I look to you like I care about that?\nMELISSA: (sees his nose starting to bleed) Oh, my God.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I need you to get those drugs for me. Do you have any weapons, a gun?\nMALE ATTENDANT: (to Melissa) Go call the Captain. (to Bowman) Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down. You're going to scare the passengers.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: They should be scared. What weapons do you have?\nMELISSA: (on phone to cockpit) Yeah, it's Melissa.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: What weapons!?\nMELISSA: (to cockpit) We have a man here, who's claiming to be in...\nMALE ATTENDANT: We have a Taser in the cockpit, which I will use on you if you don't calm down.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Taser won't do a thing. It'll just piss me off.\nMELISSA: (to cockpit) He wants drugs, but he seems to be on something already.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I need you to do what I say. I'm going into that bathroom. You keep me in there. You keep that door closed. Get whatever sedatives you can as soon as you can.\nMALE ATTENDANT: You can go in that bathroom, sir.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I am not messing around! When you get the drugs, you come back, you knock. If I don't answer, or if I do, and what you see isn't me anymore, you keep that door closed. You hear me? You keep me in there, away from the other passengers. Get the drugs. Quick.\nMALE ATTENDANT: Yes, sir. I'll do that.\n(Bowman returns to the lavatory more distressed, losing teeth, nauseous and breathing heavy ans screaming)\nMELISSA: (on phone to cockpit) Yes, sir, but I think forty minutes is too long.\n(Passengers become very concerned as the screaming and thrashing in the lavatory becomes extremely violent)\nMELISSA: (on the cabin intercom) Ladies and gentlemen, we have a passenger who is having a hard time... Please remain calm. Everything's going to be just fine.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: (Bowman collapses as large quills thrust from the back of his torso) Ah Agh! Ah! Ah Agh! Ah!\nMALE ATTENDANT: What's he doing in there?\nMELISSA: I don't know. It just got quiet.\nMALE ATTENDANT: Maybe he passed out.\nMELISSA: The Captain says we should restrain him. I've only...\n(Bowman, fully transformed into a horrific monstrosity, blasts from the lavatory, growling and snarling. passengers scream as he begins to wreck havoc on the tail section of the aircraft)\n(in a large green field amongst the woods near Scarsdale NY, kids play and laugh. a dozen cars are parked around the soccer practice, a trio is headed to the minivan)\nMOM: (to the boys as they pile in) Seatbelts, seatbelts.\n(as Mom drops the rear hatch on the van, the low-flying airplane appears in the reflection of the hatch window. she turns and watches with concern. she pivots to follow the aircraft as it passes overhead. seconds later, the left wing dips sixty degrees as the aircraft descends to the wooded treeline just over a mile away from mom. almost immediately, a huge fireball barrels into the sky from the destroyed aircraft)\nOLIVIA: (walking into the boudoir) Well, hello.\nELLA: Look, Aunt Liv, I'm beautiful. (from playing dress-up)\nOLIVIA: You are beautiful.\nRACHEL: (intercepting the errant girl) Yes, you're beautiful. But why don't we put this down and take these off? Here, give me... what else do you have here? I'll take that. Alright. Go wash that off.\nELLA: Okay. (leaves)\nRACHEL: (to Olivia) Sorry.\nOLIVIA: Oh, please. That's fine. Do you remember when we had that sleepover at Aunt Missy's? And then you found the perfume and poured it all over... was it Lola?\nRACHEL: No, Lola was the hamster. Roxy was the dog.\nOLIVIA: Right.\nRACHEL: (looks at ring) Liv, what is this? Is this Mom's? (inspecting the inscription) 'Always'? This isn't Mom's.\nOLIVIA: No. It's from John.\nRACHEL: John... Your partner, John?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nRACHEL: You told me that you guys were... he asked you to marry him?\nOLIVIA: Uh, no. He didn't. It was a mistake - suffice to say that it never actually happened.\nRACHEL: Uh, no. You can't do that.\nOLIVIA: Well, I have to.\nRACHEL: I am your sister, and I have told you every excruciating detail of my failed marriage. There's nothing that you can...\nOLIVIA: ...He was a traitor. The people that he was working with, we still don't even know who they were. But whoever they were, he was bad. And whatever was between us was a lie, so that he could gain my trust, so that I didn't see him for what he was.\nRACHEL: God, Liv... I'm so sorry.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Me too.\nRACHEL: And I thought Greg was a jerk.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Greg is a jerk.\nRACHEL: Yeah. Greg is a jerk.\nOLIVIA: (answers ringing phone) Hello? (listens) Where?\nBROYLES: (walking through the wreckage) Flight 718 went down a little after six P.M. Witnesses say the plane just fell out of the sky. Once we recover the black box, we'll know more.\nOLIVIA: So why are we here? Shouldn't NTSB be taking point?\nBROYLES: According to Air Traffic Control, they got a distress call from the pilot, but it was cut off and they lost communication. Whatever happened up there, has something to do with what I'm about to show you. It's burned badly. Forensics thought it was an animal at first. They were mistaken. No one's ever seen an animal like this.\nWALTER: I can understand the confusion. This creature has pelage (fur) characteristic of an animal. And yet... (flips the charred beast) I will say this... our friend here didn't start out this way.\nCHARLIE: (approaching) Hey, Liv.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nCHARLIE: Hey... (hands her a stack of files) Copies of the manifest and passports. There's 147 passengers. It's going to be a long few days for the poor folks tasked with trying to identify the remains.\nOLIVIA: So is there anyone of any interest?\nCHARLIE: Not at first glance, no. Does the elder Bishop have any ideas about that?\nOLIVIA: Not yet. Or if he does, he isn't saying.\nCHARLIE: So the official word right now is engine failure. The pilot tried to bring it in for an emergency landing. The landing here failed to engage, the pilot lost control.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: (Olivia start flashing visions of Bowman and Hicks talking with John) The way this thing works... works... What it does to you?...It's a horror show... It's far worse than you can even imagine... I'm telling you this stuff... It's a horror show, John.\nCHARLIE: (to a lucid Olivia) What? You find something?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I think this is our guy. (refers to the file)\nCHARLIE: The fried dog man?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Marshall Bowman. We need to pull everything we can find on him.\nCHARLIE: How can you know that?\nOLIVIA: Call it my gut.\nCHARLIE: (with blind acceptance) You're good.\n(with the scorched, transformed Marshall Bowman on an examining table, the science begins)\nWALTER: I'd expect whatever caused this mutation would've completely altered his internal organs. The kidneys appear normal.\nASTRID: It also gave him four extra nipples.\nPETER: Maybe he mutated into a opossum.\nWALTER: No, opossum's have 15 mammaries. Unlike most mammals, who have an even number of nipples. Hence, the one half rule regarding nipples.\nASTRID: The one half nipple rule?\nPETER: You just had to ask, didn't you?\nWALTER: The typical number of young in a litter is usually equal to half the number of nipples on the animal. The number of nipples being the maximum litter size. Humans, for example, one child is the typical. Maximum, twins. Barring extraordinary cases - when the young far exceeds the number of nipples.\nPETER: God, I hope I never have to hear him say the word \"nipple\" again.\nWALTER: Evidence of an extradural hematoma. Possibly epistaxis.\nPETER: Meaning, he had a colossal nosebleed.\nASTRID: I know.\nWALTER: Hmmm. There's something hard inside here. (to Astrid) Scalpel. (cuts) Forceps. (digs a small disk from the left palm)\nASTRID: What is it? A tumor?\nWALTER: Not unless a tumor is made of glass.\nSIMMONS: (on phone) I need someone over at VertusAir, right now. Yes, this is about 718. What do you think?\nRODRIGUEZ: (to co-worker) Look through all the internal reports on structural breakdown...\nCHARLIE: (walking with Olivia) Here's everything we have on Marshall Bowman. Forty-two years-old, worked at a credit cortier in Marseille, managed their corporate accounts. Has Doctor Bishop been able to make a positive ID yet?\nOLIVIA: No, but we should contact the bank, and see what they can tell us about him.\nCHARLIE: Done. Back of the file are Bowman's U.S. clients.\nDANIEL HICKS: (Olivia returns to John memories and recognizes Hick from the file she is reviewing) He outdid himself this time. And he's gonna get impatient to sell it off. So you have to get the money lined up fast.\nCHARLIE: (to the mesmorized Olivia) What? Olivia, you okay?\nBROYLES: (barging in) People, we got something. Simmons, patch me in through public address. Wilson sent over the black box recording, the last sixty seconds of the flight. Play it.\n(over the office intercom)\nVERTUSAIR 718: New York Center, this is VertusAir 718 heavy. We have a report that there...\nTOWER: Tower to Vertusair 718, other aircraft calling, say again?\nVERTUSAIR 718: Our purser's reporting a disturbance in the main cabin. There seems... It's trying to get in. New York, we need an emergency land... 718... we have something on board... It's already killed at least three pass--\nPURSER: (in background) Dear God, hold that back!\n(intercom goes silent)\nBROYLES: That's it... techs' trying to recover more. Let's back to work, people. (departs situation room)\nOLIVIA: Charlie. Come here a second. See this guy? Daniel Hicks, he owns an import export company based in Chelsea. He's the guy that Marshall Bowman was flying in to meet. We need to bring him in for questioning.\nCHARLIE: This your gut again? What's going on, Liv?\nOLIVIA: Okay, this is going to sound insane. So let's just put it in the category of \"crazy things happening in Walter Bishop's lab.\"\nCHARLIE: Okay.\nOLIVIA: (quietly) John Scott and I shared consciousness. Our minds were connected through a procedure before he died, and... some of his memories are still in my head.\nCHARLIE: His memories?\nOLIVIA: And sometimes I get flashes. I see what he saw in the memory. And in one of these flashes, I saw him with Marshall Bowman and this guy... Hicks. I think they were all working together.\nCHARLIE: On what?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. A weapons sale of some kind?\nCHARLIE: Okay. I'll bring him in.\nOLIVIA: That's it?\nCHARLIE: Despite the thousand questions I have in my head right now, I'm going to bite my tongue.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(heading for a desk, Olivia continues the investigation with a phone call)\nPETER: (in the lab, answers the call from Olivia) Bishop's House of Horrors.\nOLIVIA: Hey, how we doing?\nPETER: Good, we got the blood-work back. You were right, it is Marshall Bowman.\nOLIVIA: Anything else?\nPETER: Yeah, Walter seems to think he was dosed with some kind of designer virus.\nOLIVIA: So, it was intentional.\nPETER: Hard to say it was an accident, this stuff doesn't exist in nature. And whoever did it, would have to have a deep understanding of cutting-edge genetics. I mean it completely rewrote Bowman's DNA. Even if the plane hadn't of crashed, he wouldn't have survived the transformation. And there's something else - and this falls under the heading of \"what the hell?\" - but we found something in his left hand. Here, I'll stream it to you. (captures picture with his cell phone) It's a glass disk, about the size of a nickel.\nOLIVIA: (looking at picture from Peter) I don't believe it. We found a similar disk on the D.E.A. agent a few months back.\nPETER: I thought you told me that Bowman was a banker. Now you're telling me he's some kind of agent?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. But Charlie is bringing in a guy who might be able to give us some answers.\n(in an interrogation room at the Federal Building)\nCHARLIE: Tell us about your business, Mr. Hicks.\nDANIEL HICKS: My business... Import and export. But you know that already. You just came from my office.\nCHARLIE: Why don't you indulge us, Mr. Hicks? What do you import and export?\nDANIEL HICKS: Furniture, mostly. Mostly French. 18th and 19th Century. I'd like to know what this is all about. I run a clean business.\nCHARLIE: How do you know Marshall Bowman?\nDANIEL HICKS: He's my banker, overseas. Why, has he gotten into some kind of trouble?\n(in the observation room)\nWALTER: This is wonderful. Don't you agree? It's just like a good detective movie.\n(in the interrogation room)\nCHARLIE: Mr. Hicks, have you heard what happened on Flight 718?\nDANIEL HICKS: Yeah, that's the plane that crashed, right?\nOLIVIA: This might be hard to recognize, but... this is Marshall Bowman. He was on board of that plane. (hands over a picture of Bowmans corpse\nDANIEL HICKS: (upset) I... I don't understand.\nOLIVIA: I believe you do, Mr. Hicks. I believe you know how that happened. I believe that you and Marshall Bowman conspired to distribute a deadly virus, and this is the unintended result.\nDANIEL HICKS: Look... I think you have me mistaken for someone else.\nCHARLIE: (to Hicks) Your nose is bleeding. (to the observation room) Can we have a box of tissues, please?\n(in the observation room)\nWALTER: (to Peter) No. No, tissues won't help. Get me some sedatives. Now! (they dash out)\n(in the interrogation room)\nDANIEL HICKS: I need help. (stands, convulses) Ah, ahhh.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what's happening? (as he rushes in)\nWALTER: I suspect the same thing that happened to that man in the airplane. (Peter arrives with a First Aid kit and Walter begins to treat Hicks) I may be able to suspend the process.\nOLIVIA: No! Not yet. Not until he talks.\nDANIEL HICKS: Please!\nOLIVIA: You want help? I want answers.\nDANIEL HICKS: We... must... have been... dosed.\nOLIVIA: I want to know the name. Who dosed you?\nDANIEL HICKS: Conrad. Ah! (Walter injects Hicks)\nPETER: (as Hicks falls to the floor, bloody and in the throes of a seizure) Oh. I don't think that's working.\n(Olivia stares as Hicks goes limp)\n(plowing through boxes in a side corridor)\nASTRID: (enters) I checked the D.H.S. database, nothing came up on a 'Conrad', first or last name, when cross-referenced with a Daniel Hicks.\nOLIVIA: Well so far, there's no mention of a \"Conrad\" in John's old files, either.\nASTRID: Why don't you let me take a turn?\nOLIVIA: Thank you. (leaves the hall and joins the Bishops at work) Anything?\nWALTER: Yes. As often is the case, there's good news and bad news. He is transforming, but I placed him in a medically-induced coma to slow the process.\nOLIVIA: Which is that? The good, or the bad?\nWALTER: Huh?\nOLIVIA: Which is it? The good news, or the bad news?\nWALTER: That's the bad news. The good news is that I have already synthesized a preliminary sample of an antidote. I'm testing it on tissue samples as we speak - and... a watermelon (holds up a slice) as a control group.\nOLIVIA: And will it be ready in time?\nWALTER: That depends on your definition of time. If you mean before he turns into a beast, I wouldn't wager on it, no.\nOLIVIA: Wonderful. (wondering about Hicks) Cut open his hand.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: I want to see if there's a disk in it. Like Bowman's.\nWALTER: I like cutting.\n(Olivia places a plastic bag in front of him)\nBROYLES: Where did you get these?\nOLIVIA: One of them was in Bowman's palm. The other one was on Hicks. We've seen one of these before. Did the N.S.A ever determine what it was for?\nBROYLES: A data storage device. Apparently used to transport information.\nOLIVIA: I want authorization to exhume John Scott's body.\nBROYLES: John Scott?\nOLIVIA: I think he may have one of these on him, too. I think he was working with Bowman and Hicks.\nBROYLES: I'm afraid that won't be possible.\nOLIVIA: Well, then make it possible.\nBROYLES: Excuse me?\nOLIVIA: I know it's against protocol, but right now, I don't give a damn.\nBROYLES: Stop.\nOLIVIA: And if you don't want to ask Harris, then...\nBROYLES: I said stop.\nOLIVIA: I'll go and ask him, myself.\nBROYLES: You can't dig up John Scott's body. And that other disk... it didn't go to the N.S.A.\nOLIVIA: Where did it go?\n(walking the halls to meet Nina)\nBROYLES: One of the advantages of being the Defense Department's biggest contractor is that Massive Dynamic has money to develop technologies generations beyond that of the US government. So when we were unable to retrieve the information off the disks, I requested Nina's help.\nOLIVIA: But I suspect you telling me this isn't the only reason we're here.\nNINA: (waiting around a corner) Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Miss Sharp.\nNINA: For what it's worth, it was not my decision to keep this from you. (referring to the secure lab behind her. the trio enters)\n(Olivia approaches the enclosed John and studies him)\nBROYLES: As you suspected, we discovered a glass disk identical to the others, embedded in Agent Scott's hand.\nNINA: While he may appear to be alive, I assure you he is not. We've kept him in a suspended state because we believe that the information stored in the disks self-destructs when the disk's host dies. We attempted to utilize Agent Scott's body... His blood, his D.N.A., to try to retrieve the data. The small amount of information we were able to gather seems to implicate Agent Scott as part of a bio-terrorist cell.\nBROYLES: There were also references to a Conrad. We believe he's a scientist. Designing chemical and biological weapons for sale on the black market. C.I.A. has received scattered intel on him in the past, nothing concrete. We don't even know his full name.\nOLIVIA: So a plane full of people are dead - and our best lead is... nothing? A chemist, whose name we don't even know?\nBROYLES: It gets worse. Three hours ago, French Intelligence related to D.C. that an informant of theirs claims a major weapons sale is about to go down in Chicago. However, what the informant was unable to say is exactly where, or when, the sale is going to take place. What the informant did know is that the man behind the sale is known as Conrad.\nPETER: (answers phone in the lab) Hello?\nOLIVIA: I'm on my way back. Is Walter there?\nPETER: Yeah, why?\nOLIVIA: I just got word that Conrad's planning on selling this virus.\nPETER: What? When?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. But if I'm right, and John was working with these guys, then he has it in his memory, which means that it's in mine.\nPETER: Olivia... you know how dangerous this is...\nOLIVIA: Tell Walter to prep the tank. I'm going back in.\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Be careful. (closing the door on the sensory tank)\nASTRID: We're online.\nWALTER: (sitting at the console) Alright. Olivia, can you hear me?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: You must listen to my voice at all times. It is your connection, your lifeline. Understood?\nOLIVIA: Understood.\nWALTER: I am going to try and guide you through John Scott's memory in an attempt to take you back to the place where he met our comatose friend, Mr. Hicks. Now, picture yourself at the top of a steep flight of stairs. As you descend, step by step, you'll become progressively more, and more relaxed. Now, here come the last five steps... four... three... two... one. (Olivia bolt awake in John's memory) Where are you?\nOLIVIA: I'm in a bedroom. No, it's not a bedroom. This is where we used to meet. John and I.\n(Memory Olivia and Memory John come into the room and fall onto the bed in a romantic embrace directly in front of Tank Olivia)\nOLIVIA: Oh, man. This is crazy.\nJOHN: Absolutely, this will never happen again.\nOLIVIA: No.\nPETER: Ask her what she sees.\nWALTER: What do you see?\nOLIVIA: Me and John.\nWALTER: Don't worry, he can't see you. Remember, you're observing a memory.\nOLIVIA: (Memory Olivia excuses herself and heads to another room) I'll be right back.\nJOHN: (Memory John converses with Tank Olivia) Hi, Liv.\nWALTER: Olivia, what's happening?\nOLIVIA: John's talking to me.\nWALTER: That's not possible, Olivia. He can't see you. We'll try to take you elsewhere. Where John and his accomplices met.\nOLIVIA: (draws her weapon as John moves toward her) Don't move.\nJOHN: Liv, what's wrong?\nOLIVIA: Stop. Don't. Don't move.\nWALTER: Olivia, focus on the sound of my voice.\nOLIVIA: I said stay there.\nJOHN: I miss you.\nOLIVIA: Don't move. I'm going to ask you a question, and you're going to give me the answer. You were working with a man named Conrad. He developed a biological weapon. I want to know who he is, and who he's planning on selling it to.\nJOHN: Liv, put the gun...\nOLIVIA: Stop lying to me, John. I know that you're part of a terrorist cell. We have your partner in custody. Hicks. He's dying. And Bowman is already dead. They were infected with some kind of a virus.\nJOHN: (approaching) Liv...\nOLIVIA: No! (fires into his John's chest)\nPETER: (her monitors spike in the lab) What just happened?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nPETER: We need to get her out, now.\nWALTER: It's too dangerous. She's too far in. We need to reconnect before we pull her out.\nWALTER: Olivia, can you hear me? Olivia? Olivia, can you hear... (echo) Olivia?\n(walking down a damp alleyway in John's memories)\nOLIVIA: Walter?\nJOHN: (from nowhere) Olivia.\nOLIVIA: I want answers, John.\n(at the end of the alley a limousine comes around a corner and passes by)\nJOHN: There he is.\nOLIVIA: Who?\nJOHN: Conrad. He's a monster, Liv. Capable of creating horrible things. Weapons, which he does for no other reason than because he can. 'cause he's curious. Then he sells them to the highest bidder. That's him. (points to himself high on a fire escape stairway, holding a sniper rifle) And that's me. Problem was, we were hunting a man none of us had ever seen before. If I'd have known I had him in my sights, I could've taken him out right then and there. It was my most important mission, and I failed. I let that monster get away. I didn't know it was him.\nOLIVIA: What mission? Who were you working for?\nJOHN: Bowman and Hicks. The truth is, they were and they are government agents. N.S.A., secret task force. And so was I.\nOLIVIA: I don't believe you.\nJOHN: It's the truth, Liv.\nOLIVIA: No, not again. If you want me to believe you, then you need to prove it to me.\nJOHN: I can't, Liv. It was Black Ops, a deniable operation. If we were to take out Conrad, there could be no record of our involvement. That's why I could never tell you. Even though I wanted to.\nOLIVIA: If that's the truth, then help me. Tell me where the sale is going down.\nJOHN: What sale?\nOLIVIA: The virus. We believe that Conrad's planning on selling it.\nJOHN: I don't know what's going on inside Conrad's organization anymore. But Hicks would know. You need to talk to Hicks. He was privy to all that information. He has it right in his hand. (John disappears)\nOLIVIA: John? John?\nJOHN: (reappearing on her other side) Liv, trust Hicks. He can help you. (disappears again)\nOLIVIA: John? John.\nWALTER: (to Peter) We have to pull her out.\nOLIVIA: (distressed) John!\nWALTER: (to Astrid) Prepare 30 C.C.s of dextroamphetamine.\n(Peter pulls Olivia t=from the tank panting and near shock, Astrid injects the dextro)\nOLIVIA: Oh, Peter.\nPETER: You're okay. You're going to be fine.\n(after recovering, Olivia returns to floor of the lab)\nOLIVIA: (on her cell phone) I understand. Thanks for checking. (hangs-up phone, approaches Peter) My contact at N.S.A. couldn't confirm a single thing that John said. Of course, John said they wouldn't be able to.\nPETER: Well, that's the perfect alibi... one that you can't confirm.\nOLIVIA: Uh, yeah. How's it coming?\nPETER: His cell sample's membranes still aren't absorbing the inhibitor. We don't know if the antidote's working yet.\nOLIVIA: But it might. We could try it and see.\nPETER: You want to wake up Hicks? Even though he could transform just like Bowman did?\nOLIVIA: Conrad could be selling this virus as we speak - and Hicks is the only one who can tell us how this is going to go down.\nPETER: And you're willing to take John's word that you can trust Hicks? It finally happened. I'm now referring to a dead guy, who only exists in your mind.\nWALTER: (interrupting loudly) Boy! I need another bag of Midazolam right away.\nPETER: What if he's still lying to you? Have you considered that? If Hicks and John are working with Conrad, that maybe John is using you to tip Conrad off. Maybe he wants to get you killed. This is a bad idea, Olivia. (Peter walks off)\nASTRID: (from nearby) My mother always says I stick my nose in places it does not belong. I know we haven't known each other that long. But you are one of the best judges of character I've ever met. So, I guess the question is what's your instinct? When you were with John, when you were looking into his eyes, was he for real?\nOLIVIA: (slow decides, then) Prep Hicks! Ready or not, we're administering the antidote.\nWALTER: An experiment... how exhilarating.\nOLIVIA: (on her cell phone) This is Agent Dunham. I need to talk to Broyles.\n(following a shot in the neck - Hicks bolts awake and sits up - gasping)\nWALTER: Sorry to wake you. Little worse than adrenaline, except perhaps lice, which is a nightmare.\nASTRID: Mr. Hicks, try and breathe normally. Can you hear me?\nWALTER: This is an antidote. While I can't guarantee that it'll actually work, I do have a recorded I.Q. of...\nASTRID: ...196.\nWALTER: Really?\nASTRID: (to Hicks) We know about the work you were doing with John Scott. Now we need your help.\n(briefing a few dozen agents)\nBROYLES: For those of you not in the know, information has come to this agency about a weapons buy. The goods? The same virus responsible for Flight 718. I know this label gets slapped on pretty much all we do, but preventing this transaction from taking place is our highest priority. The prospective buyer of this weapon landed in the United States this morning. 0700 hours, O'Hare Airport. And we were there. That suspect is now in custody. (visual footage of Ernesto being arrested on the street carrying a suitcase with the 'buy' money) And no surprise to anyone, refuses to cooperate. But we do have someone else in custody. An informant with extensive information on the players we will be dealing with - his name is Daniel Hicks. (footage of Hicks recovering in Walter's lab) And he has agreed to relay all necessary information to Agent Dunham using an encrypted and untraceable two-way radio, which we implanted earlier this afternoon. (footage of Olivia receiving her implant) Agent Francis will coordinate surveillance.\nCHARLIE: The informant disclosed that the meet is scheduled for 1600 hours, at the Fairchild Hotel, Room 1021. The seller, a man known as Conrad, will not be there. But his intermediaries will. We have agents standing by to move in in corresponding rooms. Per regulations, no raid will be ordered until Agent Dunham has visual on the weapon. When she does, she'll give the go signal. That signal will be...\nOLIVIA: Christmas.\nCHARLIE: (smuggly) Now we all look forward to seeing how she works that into conversation.\nBROYLES: Okay, people, let's get it done.\nCHARLIE: (from his forward command post) Listen up. Spotted the seller. (the criminals pull-up in front of the hotel) The seller is making a phone call. Stand by.\n(waiting in the lobby)\nOLIVIA: You didn't have to come with me, you know.\nPETER: Shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels is my M.O. - and typically, if someone is going to kill you, it's a good idea to have an ally in the room.\nOLIVIA: I'm not scared.\nPETER: Being fearless doesn't mean you're being safe.\nOLIVIA: (by radio) Astrid, how're we doing?\n(from the lab)\nASTRID: Hey. Hicks is on board and ready to go. I'm putting you on speaker.\nWALTER: So far so good, Olivia. Blood pressure 140 over 90, not bad considering 3 C.C.s of adrenaline.\nOLIVIA: Are they going to expect bona fides? Hicks, tell me what I need to know.\nDANIEL HICKS: They're going to be suspicious why they've never seen you before. You tell them you used to work with Anderson.\nOLIVIA: Anderson, okay. Got it, what else?\nDANIEL HICKS: You tell them Ernesto flew in for the meeting, but he got called back to 'the basement', and he couldn't come.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean, \"called back to the basement?\"\nDANIEL HICKS: Just say it, he'll understand.\nOLIVIA: You're not messing with me, are you, Hicks?\nDANIEL HICKS: You trusted John Scott, right? Then trust me.\nCHARLIE: (by radio) He's on the move - seller's heading inside.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) That's him. Here we go. (the two head to the entrance with the case full of money)\nCHARLIE: Liv... you be careful.\nOLIVIA: You're Gavin. Susan. I used to work with Anderson.\nGAVIN: I was expecting someone else.\nOLIVIA: Well, Ernesto flew in, but he was called back to the basement, so he couldn't make it.\nGAVIN: (points to Peter) Who's he?\nOLIVIA: Who are they? (about his thugs)\nGAVIN: We'll sweep you and get to business.\nOLIVIA: Good.\n(the five saunter off toward the elevators)\nGAVINS' MAN: (after sweeping Olivia with an electronic detector) She's clean.\nGAVIN: (to Peter) The money please? (to Olivia) Just a formality, I assure you. (the money is loaded into a counting machine) It will only take a moment. (to Peter) Have we met before? You look familiar. Did you work with Anderson, too?\nDANIEL HICKS: (by phone to Olivia) He's testing you. You tell him Peter met Anderson at New College at Oxford. They met at Oxford. New College. (to Peter) Isn't that right?\nPETER: (to Gavin) What does it matter to you where I met anyone?\nGAVIN: Where did you meet? On campus?\nDANIEL HICKS: Where they met? I'm sorry, I don't know that. I don't know where exactly it was.\nPETER: (improvising) We met at the White Horse. On Wheatly Road, you know it?\nGAVIN: I don't recall.\nPETER: You would. Thai food... it's fantastic. That's where I met Anderson. I could tell you what each of us was wearing, if you want to hear it.\nAGENT #3: (command post chat) Where the hell did he come up with that?\nCHARLIE: I have no idea.\nGAVINS' MAN: (to Gavin) It's all here.\nGAVIN: (to Olivia and Peter) Have a seat. I have to admit... I was skeptical that you'd come at all.\nOLIVIA: (sitting) Well, of course we came.\nGAVIN: I thought it would be Paris all over again.\nDANIEL HICKS: (by radio) Tell him that was because of the French intelligence report, and he knows it.\nOLIVIA: That was because of the French intelligence report. You know that.\n(a case with the deadly drugs is brought in and displayed)\nGAVIN: True. But this is a larger purchase. (answers ringing phone) Hello? (listens) Okay. (to Olivia) Conrad would like to see you.\nOLIVIA: When?\nGAVIN: Now. He's on his way.\n(tension builds in the command post)\nAGENT #3: What's going on? Do they have the package? Why isn't she calling the raid?\nCHARLIE: Because Conrad's coming.\nAGENT #3: So what?\nCHARLIE: So she doesn't want to scare him off. She wants to get him. She's waiting for Conrad.\n(faces in the command post and lab show concern)\nGAVIN: We've included this with the purchase. (holds up a vial) It's a reverse mutator. An antidote. It would take you years to reverse engineer an antivirus. It's why the purchase price is so high. The formula in itself is deceiving in it's complexity.\nOLIVIA: Well, we shouldn't have a need for that.\nGAVIN: It's only in case of accidental exposure. Which, I assure you, would be fatal. Now why wouldn't Ernesto call me back himself? And tell me someone else was coming to meet?\n(in the lab, Hicks starts to bleed heavily from the nose)\nDANIEL HICKS: Uh oh... Oh, god.\nWALTER: (to Astrid) Get me a tranquilizer quickly.\nASTRID: (to Olivia) It's happening to him. Hicks is transforming.\nGAVIN: Well?\nOLIVIA: How would I know? I'm not Ernesto's mother.\nGAVIN: At least tell me who he was meeting.\nDANIEL HICKS: Uh.. oh.. ah!\nWALTER: Quickly! Quickly!\n(agents in the command post get very concerned with events in the lab and Room 1021)\nCHARLIE: (to command post personnel) What the hell is going on?\nGAVIN: I asked you... a simple question. Who was Ernesto meeting?\nASTRID: (to Hicks) I need a name. Somebody, anybody else in your operation. (to Olivia) Oh, no. Oh, god. Hicks is out.\nGAVIN: I'll ask you again... who was your colleague meeting?\nAGENT #3: (listening in next room. to Charlie) Sir, should we move in?\nPETER: (jumps to his feet) Okay! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Okay! Okay! (weapons drawn on him) That's enough. Now, just tell them! Tell them, I'm not getting greased over Ernesto's dirty little secret.\nGAVIN: What secret is that?\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) Shut your mouth!\nPETER: (to Gavin) Ernesto is sick. He's... he's dying... sick, okay? He just doesn't want anybody to know.\nCHARLIE: (listening in next room) Damnit, Liv. Give the signal.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) What the hell is wrong with you? He asked you...\nPETER: What the hell is wrong with me? I got a gun in my face, for starters.\nGAVIN: Enough of you. Shut up!\nPETER: Get that gun out of my face right now.\nCONRAD MOREAU: (enters from side room) Gavin! Who are these people?\nGAVIN: According to them, Ernesto's sick.\nOLIVIA: It's true. He found out the day before Christmas.\nCONRAD MOREAU: I spoke to Ernesto this morning. He's fine. Kill them both right now.\nCHARLIE: (charging in with team) FBI!\n(Olivia and Peter slug those holding guns on them)\nAGENT X: Put the gun down! Put the gun down!\nAGENT Y: Hands on the table. Get down. (criminals are subdued)\nOLIVIA: (to a bent over Conrad being arrested) John Scott says hi.\nBROYLES: Turns out, Conrad's a French citizen. Conrad Etienne Moreau. Wanted in connection with at least half a dozen biological attacks. And those are just the ones we know about. He's been manufacturing biological weapons and distributing them on the black market for years. And you caught him. I'd think you could at least let yourself crack a smile about that.\nOLIVIA: I didn't do it alone.\nBROYLES: You know... despite the successful outcome of this case, John Scott's status remains the same. As far as this Department is concerned, he was a traitor. Even if he was telling the truth. There's no way to confirm it.\nOLIVIA: That's alright. I know the truth. And that's enough.\nOLIVIA: (enters the lab) Hello? Anyone here? (studies the tank)\nWALTER: (returning from side room) Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Where is everyone?\nWALTER: They took that gentleman that was here to the hospital, to recover.\nOLIVIA: So the antidote worked?\nWALTER: He started improving almost as soon as I administered it. Which is more than I can say for my own concoction. Any case, I was just about to read a bedtime sto...\nOLIVIA: Walter... I was hoping you'd do me a favor.\nWALTER: Even if you did go back in, I'm dubious you'd even be able to find him.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nWALTER: Your brain wave patterns are returning to normal. Your mind is finally succeeding in purging itself of Agent Scott. Even if you could reconnect, it'd be for seconds, minutes at best, and then you would never see him again.\nOLIVIA: Then we need to do this now.\n(Olivia relaxes in the tank. she is alone on a small pier at a lake in Autumn. John appears directly behind her)\nJOHN: It's beautiful out here, isn't it?\nOLIVIA: We caught him today. Conrad.\nJOHN: Really?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry that I doubted you. I should've trusted you.\nJOHN: No, it wasn't your fault. I always meant to tell you. I guess I ran out of time. There was one other thing. (he takes her ring from a box and puts it on her finger). I know we can't ever be together. Not really. Maybe I won't know the difference. (they kiss) I love you, Liv. (he disappears)\nOLIVIA: (at rest in the tank) I love you, too."

(sits sketching Dunham)\nSALMAN KOHL: I have your appeal request all prepared and ready to go. It goes without saying the German government are not big fans of yours. You did, after all, steal state secrets. I think that the best that we can hope for is 'life', hmm? (turns back to Jones) Now, all I need is your signature. (neck is snapped by Jones)\n(Jones prepares for teleportation, disappears in a beam of light, reappears in a beam of light near Little Hill Field, MA; guards run the corridors of the prison)\n(rest of prologue in German. first hallway)\nGUARD 2: Sound the alarm!\n(a second hallway)\nGUARD 1: The perimeter is sealed!\nGUARD 2: Have they checked the cameras?\nGUARD 1: They're checking again now!\n(approaching & in the cell)\nGUARD 1: That's impossible.\nGUARD 1: (to the Warden) All protocol was followed, sir. The facility is on lockdown. We don't know what happened here.\nJOHAN LENNOX: But we do know... that the prisoner in this cell is gone. (staring at the dead attorney and the scorched walls)\nOLIVIA: (walking in) Is your father about?\nPETER: Right here. Why don't you ask him what he's doing?\nOLIVIA: I'd rather not. (as Walter mucks around Gene's udders) Listen. Do you remember that prisoner Jones I went to see...\nPETER: ...in Germany, right?\nOLIVIA: He escaped.\nPETER: Good for him. How?\nOLIVIA: Uh, nobody knows. It makes no sense. The German authorities came to see me last night.\nPETER: How come when nobody knows and it doesn't make sense, they come to us?\nOLIVIA: Well, what we do know is that Jones was working with Mitchell Loeb.\nWALTER: Oh, I remember Loeb. That's the guy that stole my invention?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I'm gonna go and talk to him now. But can you describe to me again what you made? What Loeb was stealing.\nPETER: And why don't you tell her the truth this time. He kind of sugar-coated last time around.\nOLIVIA: You did? Why? Is it something that could have helped Jones escape?\nWALTER: It was a - transportation device. I called it 'DizRay', coined based on the premise disintegration, reintegration, dis-re, 'DizRay'.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying that you created a...\nPETER: ...a teleportation system, yeah. Except for, this one was meant to travel through time. How's that?\nWALTER: Assuming someone could solve the considerable problems, coming through it - arriving would require weeks of decompression in a barometric tank. And if you survived that, based on what would happen next... you'd likely wished you hadn't.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that Jones, in theory, could have zapped himself out of prison.\nWALTER: Uh... yes. (nods)\nDAVIS: Equilibrium has been reached. Decompression is complete. (The barometric tank steams open and out climbs David Jones) Welcome back sir.\nDAVID JONES: Cup of tea, please?\nDAVIS: Of course.\nDAVID JONES: (later, to his gathered colleagues) Firstly, I'd like to thank you, for the work you've done. For bringing me here. I understand there have been sacrifices. I am grateful to them, as I am to you. Everything is in order then.\nDAVIS: Yes sir. The list is complete. We've got a lab set to your specifications.\nDAVID JONES: And the sealant?\nDAVIS: All parts.\nDAVID JONES: Good. (hand shakes as he sips his tea)\nTHOMAS AVERY: (to a browser) Hey, you know it's not a library here, you know? - and I don't make loans. (A male patron wearing a latex glove approaches, selects a paper and pays) That is seventy-five cents my friend. Of course it's old news now, given the old internet and all that. You must be an old traditionalist like myself, right? Hey, hey, hey, I like these. You don't see the two dollar very often. (patron walks off) Thanks. I'll keep it.\nJOANNE: (approaches) Okay, so Tommie... you were right.\nTHOMAS AVERY: Yeah, you see that? Grace Kelly?\nJOANNE: She was good. But, Jimmy Stewart was better.\nTHOMAS AVERY: I'm creatin' cinephiles one reader at a time. Now listen, I want you to check out a movie called, uh, Charade... ever seen it?\nJOANNE: Never heard of it.\nTHOMAS AVERY: Uh, oh god. Oh. I guess there's somethin' in my eyes.\nJOANNE: You okay?\nTHOMAS AVERY: Uh oh god.\nJOANNE: Tommie, you okay? (he turns and his face has 'skinned' over) Oh. My god aaahh! Oh Tommie. Tommie! He can't breathe, he can't breathe. (as the man spasms on the ground)\nBROYLES: Anything yet?\nCHARLIE: (overlooking a young shoulder) We might be on to something. Uhh... nothing local on Jones. But, uh... we found some financial records for Salman Kohl - Jones's attorney.\nBROYLES: The man found dead in Jone's cell?\nCHARLIE: He kept a slush fund that he maintained under an assumed name.\nBROYLES: Could be a mistress...\nCHARLIE: Or something less salicious... more interesting.\nBROYLES: Let me know if you find something useful.\n(Olivia awaits as a HumVee pulls up to the center of a damp parking lot full of military 'motor pool' vehicles. it stops and two armed military guards lift the shackled Mitchell Loeb off of the aft ramp)\nOLIVIA: I know about David Robert Jones. I know that you helped him escape. And that you kidnapped me on that same night. You know where Jones is.\nMITCHELL LOEB: You're not someone I... really wanna work with.\nOLIVIA: (steps forward. reading papers) Your Transfer Order... to Wallens Ridge State Prison. (snidely) You know what that place is like Mitchell. You know what they're gonna do to you... what it's gonna be like the first night?... the second?\nMITCHELL LOEB: (interjecting)... doesn't matter if you find Jones or not. He's just a part of 'the army'. - - What was written will come to pass - and nothing you do can stop that - -. --nothing--.\nOLIVIA: (at a loss for words, her cell phone rings. glaring at Loeb) Agent Dunham. (listens) It's me. (Broyles) Get the Bishops and meet me at Boston General.\nBROYLES: (entering an examination room with the science team) His name is Thomas Avery. Runs a news stand downtown. His only prior physical conditions were high cholesterol and a weak bladder. According to witnessess, the whole thing happened in less than two minutes.\nWALTER: Ceramides. They act as a signalling molecule in the skin. They control how the cells grow and differentiate. Two thoughts come to mind. The first, that this affliction might have been caused by a mutation, changing these lipids to recognize and seal any and all orifices... did they check his anus and penis?\nPETER: You think we could get the answer to that question without me in the room?\nOLIVIA: What was the other thought?\nWALTER: Sorry?\nOLIVIA: You said two thoughts came to mind.\nWALTER: Ah yes... the other was - coffee cake! Tiny pebbles of cinnamon sugar.\nPETER: (to Broyles) Once again - my father.\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) You know what this is.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) You think... Jones?\nWALTER: Peter. Help me with this please.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) You talked to Loeb. Did he give you anything?\nOLIVIA: Maybe. But nothing that relates to this exactly.\nBROYLES: Well, I'm not convinced that this is Jones' work. And what interest would he have in a news stand operator?\nOLIVIA: That's what we're going to find out. Peter!... You got a sec?\n(in the corridors of the hospital)\nOLIVIA: When I saw Loeb he said something. That Jones was only doing what had been written.\nPETER: Meaning what? Written where?\nOLIVIA: I didn't know, but we've never known what Jones's group Z.F.T. stood for. Maybe it's not the name of their organization, but, what if it's the name of their bible?\nPETER: Interesting...\nOLIVIA: So, I called a contact at the German authorities and I asked him to search any known document with those initials.\nPETER: Did he find anything?\nOLIVIA: Yes - he did. (hands him her PDA)\nPETER: \"Zerstorung durch Fortschritte der Technologie\"\nPETER\/OLIVIA: (together) Zee - Eff - Tee.\nOLIVIA: Scroll down.\nPETER: (loosely) \"Destruction by Advancement of Technology\".\nOLIVIA: It's a self-published anonymous manuscript. On their records only because it was recovered as evidence in a police raid in an unrelated case.\nPETER: They sending it to us?\nOLIVIA: They would be - if it hadn't been destroyed ten years ago. So... I was hoping that you might have one of your - weird connections?\nPETER: (feigning insult) Weird connections?\nOLIVIA: (not wanting to offend) They're... always a little weird.\nPETER: (mocking like an older brother) Well, you're always a little weird.\nOLIVIA: (waiting) What do you think? Come on.\nPETER: (letting her off the hook). I think I've got a weird connection.\nASTRID: (about the corpse) Is he contagious?\nWALTER: If he were contagious, we'd have several more orifice-less bodies by now. Scalpel please? And an empty I.V. bag.\nASTRID: Empty I.V. bag? What exactly are we doing here?\nWALTER: The obvious. Searching for evidence. Any scientific clue to reveal what caused this - Hear no evil, Speak no evil, See no evil malady. The gas trapped within his body (entubates the sealed mouth) may yield important information. Worth the study. (Astrid gags) Oh dear God... that is putrid. (nonchalant) On a separate topic, do you like coffee cake?\nDOOMED AGENT: (catching-up from behind) Take at look at this. I, um.. know someone at the S.E.C. I had her send over a list of every business that Jones's lawyer has incorporated for his clients over the last three years. Figure one, or more, of them are used to funnel cash to the Z.F.T.\nCHARLIE: This is all protected by lawyer-client privilege. How did you get her to break that?\nDOOMED AGENT: We, uh, dated... in college. And she dumped me - bad. So, I told her she owed me one. (gets disapproving stare) I, I narrowed down the list to U.S. addresses only.\nCHARLIE: Good work. (walks away with the file)\nEDWARD MARKAM: (to a patron) It's no first folio. Some tanning, pretty badly shelf-cocked. I can give you forty for it.\nCUSTOMER: Okay.\nPETER: (interrupting) You don't wanna make that deal. (inspects book being bargained over) First Edition - (The) \"Land of Laughs\"? (to patron) No matter what condition it's in, it's worth at least twice that.\nCUSTOMER: (gets the extra money from Markam) Thanks.\nEDWARD MARKAM: Have a great day. (to Peter as they head to the back of the shop) Was that really necessary?\nPETER: Ah, you know me Markam... 'Friend of the People'...\nEDWARD MARKAM: What about me? Aren't I people?\nPETER: ...people who shower.\nEDWARD MARKAM: Huh. (spies Olivia) Who's this friend?\nOLIVIA: Olivia Dunham.\nEDWARD MARKAM: (gregariously) Five dollars I can name at least one item on your night stand Olivia Dunham. Don't tell me... you're gonna like this - I'm never wrong. It's a gift... okay. Toni Morrison Novel, something by Obama, and\/or the current issue of Bon Appetit.\nOLIVIA: Uh. I'm reading 'Advanced Forensic Science' by Annemann. I keep it next to my gun.\nEDWARD MARKAM: hoh... I like this one.\nPETER: This one's just a friend and we need a favor. An anonymous self-published manuscript.\nEDWARD MARKAM: Uh-huh. 'Destruction by Advancement of Technology' - sounds sexy and very challenging.\nOLIVIA: ...and Peter says you're good.\nEDWARD MARKAM: Well, he also says that you're just a friend, so...\nPETER: (less tolerant) ...the book Markam. We need it.\nEDWARD MARKAM: Today - right?\nPETER: Right. (starts to depart) Impress me.\nEDWARD MARKAM: Nothing interests me less than impressing you.\nCHARLIE: (finds the boss in his office) I think I might have something. Warehouse building in Allston, leased to Jone's attorney. Power was cut-off for months - two weeks ago it was turned back on.\nBROYLES: The day Jones escaped from prison.\nCHARLIE: Could be a 'safe house'.\nBROYLES: (picks-up phone and speed dials out) This is Broyles. I need a search warrant authorized.\nLLOYD: (barging in) Sir.\nBROYLES: (motions her to wait) Yeah, a warehouse in Allston.\nLLOYD: (insisting) Sir. This can't wait.\nBROYLES: What is it?\nLLOYD: There's a man downstairs - says his name is David Robert Jones.\n(law enforcement agents rush to the first floor lobby)\nCHARLIE: Everybody down! (echoed)\nAGENTS: Down!.. down!.. down! Don't move! Stay calm!\nBROYLES: (from the balcony) Jones!\nCHARLIE: (drawing his pistol at near point blank) Freeze!\nDAVID JONES: (arms spread wide) I will speak only with Agent Olivia Dunham.\n(in the observation room, discussing Jones in the next room)\nSANFORD HARRIS: ...and he just turned himself in?\nBROYLES: Two hours ago. Said he'd only speak to Agent Dunham. Hasn't said a word since.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Anything else? Anything on how he escaped from prison?\nBROYLES: No information. Just another question. A key.\nSANFORD HARRIS: What key?\nBROYLES: It was found on him when he turned himself in. There are no markings on it. Forensics are doing their thing. He wanted us to find it.\nOLIVIA: He wants to talk to me. Let me in there.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Jones doesn't get to dictate the terms of his captivity.\nOLIVIA: He wouldn't be a captive if it wasn't under his terms. The only reason Jones is here is because he wants to be.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Well, that may be the case, but the United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists.\nOLIVIA: That's exactly the kind of arrogance he's expecting.\nSANFORD HARRIS: What did you say?\nOLIVIA: The man was clever enough to Star Trek himself out of a maximum security German prison, elude InterPol, arrive in Boston, and get himself apprehended - simply because he liked the idea. He's expecting us to reject his request.\nSANFORD HARRIS: And your choice is what? Give Jones what he wants - to demonstrate that we can be anti-dogmatic?\nBROYLES: I don't think that's what you're saying. Is it Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Since he arrived in town, an innocent man was killed in a shocking and gruesome way.\nSANFORD HARRIS: We don't know that was Jones.\nOLIVIA: It was Jones, and he has more planned.\nSANFORD HARRIS: And you know that how?\nOLIVIA: I don't know how to justify a hunch.\nBROYLES: (tired of the bickering) Sanford. I don't see any harm...\nSANFORD HARRIS: ...this isn't a gentleman's club, Miz Dunham. Mister Jones doesn't just get to choose the pretty one. You wanna get him to talk? Join the raid on that warehouse in Allston... see what you find.\nOLIVIA: How is that...\nSANFORD HARRIS: ...relevant? Well, because right now, he's just an escaped prisoner. But if he's playing games, as you say, I doubt he's here to help us. Show me some hard evidence that connects him to that incident downtown. (Harris leaves. Broyles gives Olivia a head nod yes - do it)\nOLIVIA: (driving and answering her cell phone) Agent Dunham\nPETER: (calling from the bookstore) I got it. The Z.F.T. book.\nOLIVIA: Stop it. Already?\nPETER: Markam found some guy who collects scientific ephemera. He had a copy in his basement. (flips through the document) This thing was never published. It was never even proofed, but, check this out. 'The advances of science, which are supposed to expand our knowledge of the universe, will, if not carefully controlled, destroy the world as we know it'.\nOLIVIA: So it's light reading?\nPETER: Wait. It gets better. 'Our technological ambition has not only driven us to the brink of catastrophe, the catastrophe has already begun. What will the Apocalypse look like? The answer, to use a term generally understood, but the specifics of which you cannot imagine, and which this document will attempt to describe, is warfare'. And that's just the foreward.\nOLIVIA: Well keep reading.\nPETER: Will do. Where you headed?\nOLIVIA: We're going to raid a building that we think may be a 'safe house'.\n(led by Olivia and Charlie, more than a dozen agents and officers in tactical gear swarm into a large industrial garage area with flashlights on and weapons drawn. they disperse)\nND Swat #2: Alpha Team Clear.\nND Swat #1: Bravo Clear.\nDELTA RADIOMAN: Delta Clear.\nECHO RADIOMAN: Echo Clear.\nCHARLIE: (aprroaches Olivia as she finds a sketch) What is it?\nOLIVIA: It's me... he was here.\nCHARLIE: (to everyone around him) I want everything bagged and tagged. Move fast! (Olivia inspects the decompression chamber)\nSANFORD HARRIS: (enters the interrogation room, takes off his jacket) I'd like to ask you some questions.\nDAVID JONES: Oh, I believe I've made myself clear. There is another I wish to speak to.\nSANFORD HARRIS: I afraid Agent Dunham is pre-occupied. Lucky you - you get me. (Jones coughs repeatedly) You don't look well.\nDAVID JONES: Which is why I was hoping to speak with Agent Dunham as soon as possible. I prefer to avoid any additional, unnecessary deaths. Now, when Agent Dunham comes to see me, I will require the following items: a standard walkie-talkie with removable crystals, metallic ballpoint pen, and an eye glass repair kit. An analog wrist watch. Your watch would do.\nSANFORD HARRIS: You sure you don't need anything else?\nDAVID JONES: Quite sure, yes.\n(an agent, off on his own, is looking through rooms and finds a desk with a two dollar bill in one of the drawers)\nOLIVIA: (joins Charlie) Anything?\nCHARLIE: Nothing criminal.\nOLIVIA: Alright. Let's lock it up and get back. (looks toward source of doomed agent yelling)\nCHARLIE: (races upstairs with Olivia and find the agent with his eyelids sealed shut) What the hell?!\nOLIVIA: I need a med kit! Now! (to Charlie) Quick. Help me hold him. He's suffocating. I need to 'trach' him. (she scalpels an opening in the agents' lower throat and inserts the breathing tube) Oh, come on. Okay, breathe. Okay. He's breathing. (as the agents' skin rapidly grows over the tube and his face - killing him) No... no, no, no, no, no.\n(Olivia and Charlie walk through the situation room full of sad faces, Harris drops his wristwatch in a paper sack)\nSANFORD HARRIS: (in the surveillance room) Where are we?\nTECH SUPPORT: We've got audio. Visual coming up right now.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Move in closer on this. I want to record every twitch.\n(in the interrogation room)\nDAVID JONES: (Olivia enters as he coughs) Oh finally. A welcome face.\nOLIVIA: A colleague of mine just died. (sits down) He was twenty-seven years old. He was due to get married next month.\nDAVID JONES: Yes. I tried to prevent that. Your Agent Harris needed some convincing.\nOLIVIA: Here I am.\nDAVID JONES: Have you brought the items I requested? (she slides the sack across the table to him) This will only take a moment.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (to the surveillance tech) Pull in tighter on this, on the hands. (as Jones disassembles the radio) What the hell is he doing? That's a thousand dollar watch. (Jones initiates a jamming signal with piercing feedback) WHOA! What's happening in there?\nTECH SUPPORT: I don't know.\nDAVID JONES: Now I've... managed to get us some privacy... it's just you and me now. But we haven't much time.\nOLIVIA: You were responsible for what happened to Thomas Avery.\nDAVID JONES: Simply the stage setter. An example that doesn't need to be followed.\nOLIVIA: Well, that implies that you're planning something else.\nDAVID JONES: Something far worse... yes.\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nDAVID JONES: First. I need your services.\nOLIVIA: What the hell do you want?\nDAVID JONES: I need you to pass a test.\n(in the observation room)\nSANFORD HARRIS: (barging-in) Get them the hell outta there. That device he's made is blocking our surveillance equipment.\nBROYLES: He can't hurt us, Sanford. He's just trying to show you who's in charge.\n(in the interrogation room)\nDAVID JONES: When I turned myself in there was a key in my pocket, as I'm sure you are aware. Take the key, which I assume is in Forensics, go to Salem, and the amusement park on Policy Street. I left something there for you. (grunts and keels over)\nOLIVIA: You need medical attention.\nDAVID JONES: (struggling) All of the assistance... in this world... could not cure me Miz Dunham. It seems that... when one is dematerialized on a molecular level and then reassembled - there are certain unadvertised side effects. But who knows? Perhaps this task I have for you could lead to something that might help me.\nOLIVIA: Tell me about the attack that you're planning.\nDAVID JONES: I wouldn't call it that. I'd call it an insurance policy.\nOLIVIA: I don't care what you'd call it.\nDAVID JONES: Even as we speak, a white cargo van is transporting an explosive device capable of killing several hundred people in the manner of the newspaper salesman and your deceased F.B.I. colleague.\nOLIVIA: When is it set to go off?\nDAVID JONES: Sixteen hours from now.\nOLIVIA: Before anything, you are going to disable that...\nDAVID JONES: ...NO. You are. But first, there's the matter of the key.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (barging-in) That's enough. (to Olivia) I want you out of this room.\nDAVID JONES: Don't worry Miz Dunham. If I wanted to harm you, I would have. Long ago. (Olivia leaves. to Harris) Apologies... about the watch.\n(walking the corridor to the elevator, donning her coat, briefing Broyles and Harris)\nOLIVIA: Jones is planting a device somewhere. Capable of killing more people in the same way that guy from the newsstand died. He won't say where or when. But we need every white van rented in the last forty-eight hours tracked down. In the meantime, I need two hours alone.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Why? Where are going?\nOLIVIA: To get a massage. (enters elevator) I'll tell you when I get back.\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone, driving) Hey, it's me. Where are we at?\nPETER: We know how the folks end up faceless. It's a powdered toxin absorbed through the skin. It triggers a hyperactivity in the protein responsible for scar tissue... you want any more detail than that?\nOLIVIA: Uh, not really. Did you hear that Jones turned himself in?\nPETER: Yeah, I did. Did you get anything?\nOLIVIA: Yeah - that he's crazy... and that he's planning on using that toxin again - and soon. How's Walter coming with the antidote?\nPETER: He's working on it. He says, and I quote - 'it'll be ready when it's ready, and not a moment before.'\nOLIVIA: Great. Anything more in the manuscript that might suggest what Jones' end game is?\nPETER: Well, it reads like a happy combo between an anti-science manifesto and a 'call-to-arms.'\nOLIVIA: A 'call-to-arms' against whom?\nPETER: Exactly. I'll call you back when I get to the good part.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Please do. Maybe it will help us figure out where this next attack is gonna be. I'll be back as soon as I get the package Jones left me.\nPETER: Okay. (hangs-up)\nWALTER: Was that Olivia?\nPETER: Yeah. (approaches Walter's workdesk) Where's the manuscript?\nWALTER: Is she bringing coffee cake?\nPETER: No. She's not getting food. Have you seen the manuscript that I was reading earlier?\nWALTER: (uncovers the document) It's fascinating, isn't it? I was just reading it while sitting on the crapper.\nPETER: Please? No more information than that - can I have it back?\nWALTER: I must read you one excerpt.\nPETER: Great. Well grab the blankie - it's nap time.\nWALTER: (voiceover as Olivia drives) We think we understand reality. But our universe is only one of many. The unknown truth is that the way to travel between them has already been discovered - by beings, much like us, but whose history is slightly ahead of our own. The negative aspect of such visitation will be irreversible both to our world and to theirs. (Olivia arrives in a deserted alley lined with locked storages) It will begin with a series of unquantifiable natural occurrences - difficult to notice at first - but growing, not unlike a cancer, until a simple fact becomes undeniable. Only one world will survive. (Olivia remove a box full of items from a container and opens it) It will either be us - or them.\nOLIVIA: (reading the letter from the box to the science team) Miss Dunham, I know how this appears, that I've sent you quite a distance to pick-up a box of children's games. But what I've hidden here is not a game at all. You are holding an evaluation system. A series of tests designed to cultivate specific innate skills present in particular individuals. Do the first test only. Complete it successfully, and come back to see me. Do this and no one else will die.\nPETER: I got the instructions.\nOLIVIA: So, Jones is threatening to kill hundreds of people unless I take a test.\nASTRID: No - unless you pass a test.\nOLIVIA: Fine. What does passing a test have to do with Jones killing innocent people?\nPETER: In a word - insanity. You can't pose rational questions when you're dealing with a guy like Jones.\nWALTER: Indeed. And whatever Mister Jones' true goal may be... we only have eight hours left until his next attack.\nPETER: (opens a shoebox size wood case with a 7X7 grid of small lights) Test One... of ten, by the way. Turn switch on. The recruit sits no more than twenty-four inches away from the device, but cannot touch the light board. Recruit focuses on light board. The object of the test is to systematically shut down the lights so that ultimately, none are illuminated.\nOLIVIA: How?\nPETER: (sarcastically) Using all your magic powers, I guess.\nWALTER: Curious. The instructions refer to the recruit. The author of the manuscript uses the same term. (reading from the manuscript) ...Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation are among us now - but before they can be considered soldiers, they must be regarded as recruits. And the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling.\nOLIVIA: So, I am supposed to just turn these lights off by looking at them.\nPETER: Well, it wouldn't be much of a test if we could just take out the battery.\nOLIVIA: (activates the light board) Fine. (looks at others half-serious. Becomes serious and starts to lose herself in the lights and gets startled as her phone rings. Everyone smiles, she sighs and answers her phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: We just got a hit. Steady Car Rentals in New Haven leased a white van yesterday morning. You're gonna love this - to one - Olivia Dunham.\nOLIVIA: No.\nCHARLIE: Oh yeah, he's messing with you, Liv. Got local police scouring the area. So far, no luck.\nOLIVIA: Thanks Charlie. This is just a stupid mind game. (walking away)\nPETER: Where are you going?\nOLIVIA: To end it.\n(in hallway)\nSANFORD HARRIS: I will not let him use that device again. If you're gonna meet with Jones, I want full surveillance this time.\nOLIVIA: Sir. The last time you got your way, we lost a good agent. Do you really want to get in the way again? (waits for a reply) We have less than seven hours before something truly horrific will happen - something that I am trying to stop. And for some reason, Jones is out to get me. So sir, would you please let me handle this? (Harris takes the brow-beating and wanders off)\n(in the interrogation room)\nOLIVIA: (places the jamming device on the table) I got your test kit.\nDAVID JONES: You didn't bring it?\nOLIVIA: No. I didn't need to 'cause this is...\nDAVID JONES: ...your reluctance is to be expected.\nOLIVIA: I know what you're doing Mister Jones.\nDAVID JONES: I'm trying to get you to pass Test Number One.\nOLIVIA: I know about the manuscript. The Manifesto. Z.F.T. I know that you believe that there's some kind of a war coming...\nDAVID JONES: ...you read it?...\nOLIVIA: ...and that you are recruiting warriors. That's the word that you use, isn't it?\nDAVID JONES: You don't believe that you're worthy?\nOLIVIA: I believe that everybody... maybe even you... is entitled to their own belief system, but somehow, you got me into your head.\nDAVID JONES: Somehow? Yes. You are among those treated with Cortexiphan. It's why we had you taken. We needed confirmation. Something which requires a 'spinal tap'. The next step, had you not escaped, was to convince you of this.\nOLIVIA: I have never been treated with Cortexiphan. I haven't even heard of it.\nDAVID JONES: You wouldn't have.\nOLIVIA: Well, I don't believe you Mister Jones. What I believe is that you've created some ridiculous scenario where people's lives rely on me attempting, and failing, what is obviously an impossible task.\nDAVID JONES: (distressed) The task is hardly impossible!\nOLIVIA: I will not let these people die because of some stupid game that you're playing.\nDAVID JONES: (louder) This is no game!\nOLIVIA: You need to cooperate Mister Jones.\nDAVID JONES: (agonized) No Miz Dunham! It is you who needs to cooperate. (falls to floor handcuffed to chair)\nOLIVIA: Mister Jones?\nPARAMEDIC: (wheeling Jones in on gurney and briefing Peter) Pulse is slowing down - fifty beats per minute.\nPETER: (pointing across lab) Get him up there. Astrid! Set up the E.K.G.\nWALTER: Is this the patient? (Gene follows on a tether)\nPETER: Walter... put the cow away would you?\nPARAMEDIC: (looking at the backside of Gene) What is this place?\nPETER: It's a freak show. Thanks for your help. Thank you. (as the paramedics leave)\n(gathered around Jones)\nWALTER: You understand, this man teleported through space. His molecules disintegrating and reintegrating. The very implications of it... We need a video camera - we should record this.\nPETER: Walter - this man is our only chance to stop a device that could kill a lot of innocent people. I need you to stabilize him.\nWALTER: Of course.\nPETER: Okay.\nWALTER: Point taken. I'll do a thorough exam. meanwhile, get me 50 cc's of saline, please.\nPETER: Hey Astrid - do you mind?\nASTRID: Sure.\n(Peter finds his way to Olivia's workspace, where she is on the phone)\nOLIVIA: No... of course they did. Why am I not surprised? Thanks Charlie. (hangs-up)\nPETER: Anything?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, that drug Jones claims is in my body... Cortexiphan, it's a drug patented, but not approved by, the FDA.\nPETER: Patented to whom?\nOLIVIA: ...to Massive Dynamic.\nPETER: (scoffs) Why am I not surprised?\nOLIVIA: That's what I just said... Jones?\nPETER: Walter's replenishing his fluids right now, but he's still gonna have to give him a full exam before we even know if we can wake him back up.\nOLIVIA: Look. I'm gonna go find out what I can about Cortexiphan - but in the meantime, he is actually expecting me to be able to do it.\nPETER: To do what?\nOLIVIA: Test number one. The flashing lights. Jones won't cooperate unless I pass the test... you think we can trick him?\nPETER: What are you asking me to do? You want me to open up the light box?\nOLIVIA: (timidly) You could see what you could do.\nOLIVIA: Thank you so much for seeing me at such short notice.\nNINA: As I said... I am always available to you, Olivia. What can I do?\nOLIVIA: I need information on a drug called Cortexiphan.\nNINA: It doesn't ring a bell... let me check. (consults her high tech 'whiteberry' and sighs in pain)\nOLIVIA: Is everything alright?\nNINA: Uh... my hand... it's been acting-up. I need to have it looked at. (returns to her PDA) Oh yes, I recall this. 'Cortexiphan' - it was part of a clinical trial of a drug that Doctor Bell created in 'eighty-one.\nOLIVIA: What is it? -- If you don't mind?\nNINA: Doctor Bell theorized that the human mind, at birth, is infinitely capable... and that every force it encounters; social, physical, intellectual... is the beginning of the process he referred to as 'limitation' - a diminishing of that potential.\nOLIVIA: And Cortexiphan?\nNINA: ... it was meant to 'limit' that 'limitation' - to prevent the natural shrinking of that brain power.\nOLIVIA: To prevent, not undo?\nNINA: Meaning...\nOLIVIA: That the drug was administered to children?\nNINA: Yes... the drugs were extensively animal tested. They were harmless to the children who received them. Unfortunately, they were also unsuccessful - so Doctor Bell abandoned his research on Cortexiphan in 1983.\nOLIVIA: And where were the trials?\nNINA: Doctor Bell conducted the trials himself at Ohio State University, Wooster Campus.\nOLIVIA: Nowhere else?\nNINA: No... why? If I may ask?\nOLIVIA: Nothing -- it's good to know.\nOLIVIA: (on the phone to Peter as she drives) No matter what Jones believes - I was never given that drug. William Bell conducted his trials in Ohio. In 1981, I was three, living in Jacksonville, Florida. My dad was stationed at the Naval Base there.\nPETER: That's great. In other news - Walter thinks he is going to be able to revive Jones soon - and - I was able to reprogram the light box.... We should be able to fake Jones out.\nOLIVIA: I knew you could do it. I'll see you soon. (hangs-up)\n(Jones is strapped to an elevated table and gets an injection in the neck from Walter)\nWALTER: If there's a cardiac arrest, we'll need Nitroglycerin... Peter! prepare...\n(Jones jumpstart to life - gasping)\nOLIVIA: Mister Jones. We have two hours before your planned attack hits... and I think I have passed test number one.\nDAVID JONES: Doctor Bishop... (congested) ... without your extraordinary work - I wouldn't have the pleasure of making your acquaintance.\nWALTER: (moves closer to Jones) I locked the teleporter away for a reason... one of which you are now experiencing.\nDAVID JONES: (shudders) Never the less. It... is.. an honor.\nOLIVIA: (interrupts) Jones. I passed the test. You tell us everything we need in order to stop whatever it is you're planning.\nDAVID JONES: (gulping) That... was.. always the deal.\n(Olivia moves to the light box test, altered by Peter. she flips it on and concentrates. slowly, the lights extinguish one after another, Jones monitors her as the last light goes out)\nDAVID JONES: Well done Miz Dunham. Thank you. (he relaxes his head)\nOLIVIA: Your turn!\nDAVID JONES: Indeed. (conceding) 9-2-3 Church Street. The forty-seventh floor... you better hurry.\nOLIVIA: (speed dialing dispatch on her cell phone) This is Agent Dunham - I need immediate Evac at Nine-Twenty-Three Church Street - There's a device on the forty-seventh floor... (to Peter as she marches past him) Nicely done.\nPETER: Good performance.\nCHARLIE: (barking orders to all in earshot at street level) I need these streets cleared now! Anyone within a four block radius has to move! - GO! Double Time!\nOLIVIA: (arriving in the lobby) Hey. Where are we?\nCHARLIE: Buildings about seventy percent clear... we lucked out - they're undergoing renovations, so not all the floors are occupied.\nOLIVIA: So... the device?\nCHARLIE: This one's a real mess. Bomb Squad says they can't move it or diffuse it.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nCHARLIE: Because they've never seen wiring like this before.\nOLIVIA: (arriving at the bomb) Oh my god... (breathing deeply, a helicopter zips by the window)\n(three minutes, twenty-eight seconds remain on the device)\nPETER: It's rigged here for a reason - to blow out the windows.\nOLIVIA: Four blocks ain't gonna cut it.\nPETER: Not even close.\nCHARLIE: I am on it (to assistant cop) Contact the Weather Service. We need a map of the fallout pattern... and get FEMA up to speed\nASTRID: (picks up the ringing phone in the lab) Agent Farnsworth.\nOLIVIA: (on her cell phone and staring at the device) Hey, it's me. That son of a bitch (Jones) knew what we were doing.\nASTRID: What?\nOLIVIA: He knew that we were faking him out.... Is he still conscious?\nASTRID: Barely.\nOLIVIA: Put him on.\nASTRID: (holds phone to Jones ear) It's Olivia.\nDAVID JONES: (exhausted) Hello, you.\nOLIVIA: I can't do this. (two minutes, forty six seconds remain on the device)\nDAVID JONES: I remain confident that you can.\nOLIVIA: Look, you know what I did before - it wasn't real.\nDAVID JONES: Yes... I know Miz Dunham. Before they can be considered soldiers - they must be regarded as recruits, and the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling...\nOLIVIA: ...Mister Jones, I am willing, I am willing, but I am not able. (two minutes, thirteen seconds remain on the device)\nPETER: (interrupts) Olivia, we have gotta go.\nDAVID JONES: There's only one way to disable that device. You know what that is.\nOLIVIA: (nods into phone) Okay - you think that I am valuable. Valuable enough to kidpnap, to try and train.\nDAVID JONES: You are a rare commodity - true.\nOLIVIA: Okay. If you don't deactivate this device. I'm gonna die. Which means that your rare commodity is gone.\nDAVID JONES: But I have one thing Miz Dunham, that you do not. I have faith in you.... there is no red wire, no blue - only black. Cut any one of them, and the device blows. Try and remove it, and the device blows. And if those light are still on when the timer hits zero... the device blows. There is only one way out - and it's you.\nOLIVIA: (she hangs-up and turns to Peter and Charlie) Okay, we need to get these people out of here. (she removes her overcoat and returns to the device)\nPETER: Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Where are you going? Olivia, we gotta go. What did Jones say? Olivia...\nOLIVIA: I need to do this. There is no other way.\nPETER: If you stay here you are going to die. (one minutes, one second remains on the device) I'm not doing this with you Olivia. (he walks off to the elevators) You're out of your mind.\n(Olivia studies the panel of lights on the device intently. Peter thinks better of his departure and returns to observe. Slowly, as Olivia concentrates, each of the 47 lights dims in random order. the final light dims just two seconds before the anticipated detonation)\nPETER: You did it. What was that? How did you do that?\nOLIVIA: (nearly in tears) I don't know. (panting) I don't know.\nASTRID: (answers a ringing phone on the lab) Farnsworth. (listens) Yes sir. (listens) Thank you. We.. we will.\nDAVID JONES: (to paramedic as he is wheeled-out) Wait... wait. (to Astrid) She did it, didn't she?\nASTRID: It seems she did.\nDAVID JONES: (whispers to himself) My girl.\n(Agents and inspectors have returned and are wandering the area, Olivia and Peter sit and rest)\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: I didn't do anything... with those lights, they... he planned it, Jones... it was all just a mind game.\nPETER: How'd he plan it? Planned what?\nOLIVIA: They were programmed to turn off when the countdown ended.\nPETER: Maybe, but... he couldn't have known you were gonna arrive. He couldn't have known the timing on that.\nOLIVIA: Well that's what he did.\nPETER: Look, I'm the last person who subscribes to this kind of stuff, but you were in the zone out there tonight, Olivia. The way you stared down that lightbox was like nothing I have ever seen before.\nOLIVIA: It wasn't me.\nPETER: Fine, then let me play Devil's Advocate - why did Jones choose you at all?\nOLIVIA: (thinks a second) Because of your father. He wanted to meet your father. he wanted to meet the man who designed the device that let him escape from prison.\nPETER: And you think that's what all this is about? Okay. Fine. Look, all I know is I didn't die tonight. So I'm pretty much willing to accept any explanation you want to give. (thinks) You wanna go get a drink? Or five? I've seen you with a whiskey bottle.\nOLIVIA: huh... Jones was just transferred to Boston General... I have a few questions for him. It's my last chance.\nPETER: ....yeah.\nASTRID: So in all the excitement of today, I forgot to say something. I haven't overlooked the fact the you actually created a teleportation machine.\nWALTER: Well... I suppose I did.\nASTRID: Which, despite the fact that using it kills you, is... pretty damn cool.\nWALTER: Kills you? It does something unthinkable, but... it doesn't kill you. (he wanders away)\n(Olivia walks the busy halls toward Jones' room. She enters and he is not there. a gaping four foot by seven foot hole in the wall looks out over the city, from a half dozen floors up. on the wall next to her in big letters, the message - \"You Passed\")\n(at his desk he reads through the ZFT manifesto. un-proofed and un-published, it is littered with offset \"y\"s.)\nOLIVIA: (seated in gym clothes with an adult beverage, she answers her phone) Hello.\nNINA: (on a balcony with her cell phone) Agent Dunham? Nina Sharp... hand's back to normal\nOLIVIA: Well, good for you.\nNINA: I was curious about that question you asked, whether there were other places where Cortexiphan was tested.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nNINA: There was, it turns out - a second clinical trial - though much smaller than the one in Ohio.\nOLIVIA: There was?\nNINA: Yes, in Jacksonville, Florida... at a military base. (silence) Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Thank you very much for calling.\nNINA: You're most welcome - have a good night.\n(from storage, Walter extracts an old manual typewriter and prepares to type. he types the word 'Ability'... like the ZFT manifesto - the 'y' is offset from the rest of the typeset)"

Gettin' too damn old for this.\nMIKE: Make sure that blast cap's on tight.\nPHIL: It's not the blast cap I'm worried about; it's my damn fingers.\nMIKE: Stop your complaining. We fall behind schedule, we violate our permit.\nPHIL: Just a minute. Almost there. (joins workers who continue to search the building before it is destroyed)\nMAN ON RADIO 1: Zone one clear.\nMAN ON RADIO 2: Zone two clear.\nMAN ON RADIO 3: Zone three clear.\nMAN ON RADIO 4: Zone four clear.\nMAN ON RADIO 5: Got a squatter in zone five. Getting him out. After that, we're clear here, too.\nMAN ON RADIO 6: Zone six clear.\nMAN ON RADIO 7: Zone seven's clear.\nMIKE: (on radio) Okay, people. Building's clean. Wrap it up and get out. We're go for demolition in three minutes.\nCONTROLLER ON RADIO: T-minus three minutes.\n(Group of men are walking away from prepared building.)\nDENNIS: So what's up, man? Stateside Diner, meatloaf sandwich?\nPHIL: Thinking steak and eggs at Cora's.\nDENNIS: Well, we could always head up Route Nine to Parkview.\nPHIL: Sure...\nDENNIS: What?\nPHIL: \"What\". The waitress. The brunette. What's her name?\nDENNIS: Oh, Marcie? No, I wasn't even... I was thinking about the lean corned beef.\nPHIL: Yeah, right, the lean corned beef named Marcie.\nDENNIS: Hold up.\nPHIL: What's the matter? You okay? Dennis, what's the problem?\nDENNIS: Nothing. I don't know.\nPHIL: - You swept it, right? - Sure.\nDENNIS: I just... I don't know. All of a sudden I got a weird feeling.\nPHIL: Yeah? Me too. Mine's called, \"I don't wanna die looking at Dennis.\" Come on, man.\nDENNIS: Hey, radio Mike, will ya? Tell him I wanna do another sweep.\nPHIL: Come on, man, where you going? Dennis, they're holding the countdown for us. Damn it! Come on. Where we going?\nDENNIS: I think we missed something. The plans show another room over here. Ahh, this doesn't make sense.\nCONTROLLER ON RADIO: Phil, you got Dennis? What's going on? We don't have a lot of time.\nDENNIS: Just two more minutes. We'll be right out. Do you hear that?\nPHIL: What?\nDENNIS: Sounds hollow.\nPHIL: Come on, man, this place has been completely prepped. There's nothing underneath there, just solid foundation.\nDENNIS: Does that sound solid to you?\nPHIL: It's probably just frost damage.\nDENNIS: The... the concrete's cracked. (hole breaks open under Dennis' feet. He falls, but is caught by Phil) Ohh!\nPHIL: (on radio) Mike, I think you should come down here.\n(joined by Mike, the three men explore the catacombs below the building with flashlights)\nDENNIS: This was definitely not in the blueprints.\nPHIL: God, and what's that smell?\nDENNIS: What do you think this was?\nPHIL: I don't know, but it's old.\nDENNIS: Well, good, that narrows it down.\n(in the dark dampness, the trio find what looks like a jail cell. something scurries to the back of the area)\nPHIL: What the hell? (a naked, hairless Child huddles in the corner of the dark cell) Oh, my god.\n(Olivia awakens slowly to find her niece staring at her, waiting to talk)\nOLIVIA: Ella?\nELLA: Mommy gets grumpy if I wake her too early.\nOLIVIA: She always did. (grabs Ella and hauls her into bed) ...mmmm, come on. Oy, oy, oy. Well, do you want some... pancakes?\nELLA: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Yeah? Mm-hmm.\nCHARLIE: (walking through the office, he answers his cell phone) Francis. (listens) Hey, Jim. How are you, buddy? I saw that your mayor got himself into a little bit of trouble. That couldn't have been fun for you guys. (listens) When? (listens - then addresses everyone in the office) Has anyone taken anything from that fax in the last five minutes?\n(receives an indistinct reply from across the room)\nCHARLIE: (into phone) I'll call you back. (searches and locates a facsimile on the machine - a picure of a broken doll and text announcing the showing of 'A Brand New Work' -- today in Boston)\nRACHEL: Ugh, Liv, I'm sorry. I told her to let you sleep late.\nOLIVIA: Oh, she did until... six-seventeen.\nRACHEL: Yup, that sounds late for her.\n(Ella enters kitchen with two garments.)\nELLA: Which one?\nRACHEL: Uh, the yellow one.\nELLA: Aunt Liv?\nOLIVIA: Definitely the yellow.\nELLA: Did you tell her?\nRACHEL: Go get dressed.\nOLIVIA: What?\nRACHEL: We went apartment hunting yesterday.\nOLIVIA: Really? You're thinking of moving to Boston?\nRACHEL: Yeah, well, Ella loves it here, and so do I, so...\nOLIVIA: Well, you know that you can stay here for as long as you want.\nRACHEL: I know, but you don't need a little creature waking you up at 6:17 every morning.\nOLIVIA: If that little creature is Ella, I am fine with it. (answers her cell phone) Hello.\nCHARLIE: It's me. The Artist is back.\nOLIVIA: How do you know? Did we receive another fax?\nCHARLIE: Yeah. Hartford Field Office got one too.\nOLIVIA: Well, did we get a trace?\nCHARLIE: Sent from a copy store in Allston. So I've got Mason and Louis headed over to question the employees, see if someone can give us a description of whoever sent it.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna be there in fifteen minutes. (hangs-up)\nRACHEL: Some new horrifying event you're not allowed to tell me about?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. (answers cell again) Okay, now it's gonna be fourteen.\nBROYLES: Excuse me, Agent Dun...?\nOLIVIA: Oh, hey.\nBROYLES: Get the Bishops soon. I need you to meet me at Children's Hospital.\nOLIVIA: Actually, I just had an old case reopened, and I...\nBROYLES: It can wait.\n(Broyles, Olivia, Walter and Peter walk down corridor toward isolation room. When they arrive, Broyles motions through window into room at the Child.)\nBROYLES: After the boy was found, construction crews performed a search of the tunnels. It was determined they'd been sealed shut for at least 70 years. The place was a sarcophagus. The only living things down there were rats, insects ...and him.\nOLIVIA: And we have no idea how he got down there?\n(Broyles shakes his head.)\nOLIVIA: He's so pale.\nBROYLES: He seems to be developing some sort of pigmentation.\nWALTER: Well, he probably hasn't seen sunlight in years.\nPETER: Does he have a name?\nBROYLES: He hasn't spoken a word since he was found. Doctor Bishop, any thoughts?\nWALTER: Perhaps. But first I need a piece of special equipment. My turntable.\nBROYLES: Is that some kind of lab equipment?\nWALTER: No, a turntable. Record player. You enjoy music, don't you, Mister Broyles? Well, imagine the agony of having an extensive record collection, and having no means to play it.\nPETER: The agony.\nBROYLES: I'll have someone get right on that. (taps on window of isolation room to get attention of physician, who exits to hallway)\nBROYLES: This is Doctor Winick, Chief of Pediatrics.\nDR. WINICK: Look, I understand your agency's taken an interest in this child, but he's been through quite a trauma.\nPETER: Is he sick?\nDR. WINICK: Not as far as we can tell, but he's having difficulty breathing. We need to administer oxygen.\nWALTER: No, don't. No. no. no. I wouldn't do that. You said the tunnel was sealed, is that correct? Well, then it's obvious that the child was trapped in a low-oxygen environment for so long that his body adapted to it. And that is why he's having trouble breathing.\nDR. WINICK: I don't think so.\nWALTER: (abrasively) Unless you have an IQ higher than mine, I'm not interested in what you think. Administering additional oxygen at the stage would simply cause his lungs to fill with fluid and drown him where he lies. (Walter makes eye contact with Broyles and Winick and calms somewhat) We need to deprive him of oxygen. Get him a nasal cannula and a tank with low oxygen content. Perhaps five percent to start. (Winick raises an eyebrow, but seems to understand)\n(Olivia looks into the room and stares at the Child. They seem to bond)\n(Samantha Gilmore is removing clothes from a dryer and folding them. The Artist does the same in the near background)\nTHE ARTIST: A griffin.\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: 'Scuse me?\nTHE ARTIST: Your tattoo. The body of a lion and the head of an eagle. That's a Griffin, right?\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: Just picked it outta the sample book. Thought it looked cool.\nTHE ARTIST: Oh, well. A nice choice. Did it hurt much? I always imagined getting a tattoo would hurt real bad.\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: It's a good pain.\nTHE ARTIST: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you or any...\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: You didn't.\n(Gilmore watches as the Artist pushes back from the folding table and rolls away in a wheelchair. Gilmore looks moderately embarrassed about having been brusk with the man. Soon after, Gilmore exits the laundromat and walks to her motorcycle. She sees the Artist trying to place his laundry basket into his van.)\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: Hey. Do you need a hand?\nTHE ARTIST: Uh, thanks, I got it. (pauses) Um, actually, you know, a little help would be great.\n(Gilmore walks over and lifts the laundry basket)\nTHE ARTIST: Cool motorcycle. What make?\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: '67 Harley Shovelhead.\nTHE ARTIST: She's a beauty.\nSAMANTHA GILMORE: Yeah, she is.\n(Gilmore turns her back to put the basket into the van. The Artist rises from his wheelchair and lunges at her with a hypodermic needle)\n(in the back of his van, The Artist uses a saw and power drill. he wears a butchers apron and latex gloves and is covered in blood as he continues his work)\n(the Child sits in bed, breathing heavily with a nasal oxygen tube while the room full of adults waits and watches)\nWALTER: Any minute, now.\nDOCTOR WINICK: (as the heavy breathing abates) It worked.\nWALTER: You'll want to increase the oxygen flow by ten percent every hour 'til he acclimates.\nOLIVIA: So you said that he hasn't talked. How do we know he can hear?\nDOCTOR WINICK: He responds to sound. And we examined his tympanic membrane, there's no physical damage. In fact, considering how he was found, he seems fairly healthy. His heart sounds fine, his blood pressure is strong.\nOLIVIA: And how do we think he survived down there? I mean, what did he eat?\nWALTER: Rats, I'd think. Moss, insects. High in protein. Tastier than you may think, especially millipedes. Although they all lack certain minerals which may account for his follicular dilemma.\nPETER: (interjects) His baldness.\nWALTER: Have you performed a urinalysis?\nDOCTOR WINICK: We haven't been able to. We've been feeding him intravenously. He hasn't relieved himself since he arrived.\nWALTER: Can't say I blame him for not wanting to try this. (picks-up a slice of dry toast) This looks worse than the dreadful food they served at St. Claire's.\nDOCTOR WINICK: You were on staff at St. Claire's Asylum?\nWALTER: No, no, no, not a medical doctor. I was a patient.\nPETER: (diverting the conversation) Got such a sense of humor, huh?\nWALTER: Hmm?\nPETER: Walter, what do ya say we keep those old St. Claire's stories to ourself, yeah?\nOLIVIA: Hello. (approaches the Child tenderly) My name's Olivia. What's yours? (her phone startles her) It's my phone. (she answers it) It's Charlie. Hi. I'm, uh, still in the hospital.\nWALTER: You won't remember this, Peter, but you didn't talk much either, as a child.\nOLIVIA: (on her cell phone) Could you get me the address?\nWALTER: In fact, you were quite shy.\n(the Child watches intently as Olivia writes the location of the first victim in her notebook. he grabs her arm with a jolt, takes her pen and writes a name upside in the notebook)\nWALTER: What's it say?\nOLIVIA: Sam Gilmore.\nPETER: He can write?\nOLIVIA: Is that your name?\nBROYLES: I'll see what we have on any Sam Gilmores in Massachusetts.\nAGENT: (approaching the Artist's handiwork) The body was found just after 6:00 pm. This part of the park's usually empty this time of the year. Couple of kids were using it as a shortcut when they found her. Definitely the work of the artist. He clearly made alterations to the body post mortem, and put her out here for the whole world to see. Here's what we have so far. (hands Charlie a file) She's a local girl. A process server from Weston. Next of kin is being notified by local agents as we speak.\nCHARLIE: Samantha Gilmore.\nOLIVIA: Wait, did you say Sam Gilmore?\nCHARLIE: Yeah. (opens the file to confirm the identity) Samantha Gilmore. You know her?\nCHARLIE: (to room full of agents) Our perp's name is the artist. Now, some of you here may recall that we had our first encounter with him three years ago. He killed four women in Lower Jamaica Plain over a period of two days. After the fourth murder he stopped.\nOPERATOR: (on phone with Olivia) Are you holding for Dr. Winick?\nCHARLIE: ...apparently he...\nOLIVIA: (to Operator) Uh, yes.\nCHARLIE: Samantha Gilmore, age twenty-four. Now, the killing bears all of the artist's trademarks. His M.O. is to kidnap, sedate, and kill his victims. Then after he kills them, using surgical tools and chemicals, he, in his mind, enhances their appearance. In this case he bleached her skin, removed multiple piercings, and dyed her hair,\nOPERATOR: ...I'll tell Doctor Winick...\nCHARLIE: Like the others...\nOLIVIA: (on phone) Thanks.\nCHARLIE: It was preceded with a faxed invitation to view new work that was to be displayed somewhere in public.\nBROYLES: (quietly at her desk, sitting) Anything yet?\nOLIVIA: No. That was the hospital. They're giving the boy an MRI. When he's done I'm gonna go in and talk to him again. In the meantime I've sent his picture to Samantha Gilmore's friends and family, but, so far, no one recognizes him.\nBROYLES: You didn't really expect that they would, did you?\nOLIVIA: No.\nBROYLES: So let me ask you the obvious. What's the connection?\n(Walter and Peter enter after the briefing and share some reseach)\nWALTER: (flipping through images in a book) Amala and Kamala, the Wolf Girls of India. And... and, ah... Marie-Angelique Memmie Leblanc, the Wild Girl of Champagne. They're all feral children who... who grew up completely isolated from human contact, surviving, like our boy, uh, for many years alone.\nPETER: Yeah, but I'm guessing none of them could write upside-down.\nBROYLES: You're saying that the boy grew up down there.\nWALTER: Well, based on the blood work, yes. I'm fairly certain that the lack of vitamin D, for one, but also the complete absence of lactobacillus...\nPETER: (interrupts) ...micro-organisms is that help us digest. They're everywhere.\nWALTER: Precisely. If the boy had spent any time above the ground, then he certainly would have absorbed those.\nOLIVIA: But that still doesn't explain how he got there in the first place. You said that the place had been sealed off for decades. The boy couldn't be more than - ten?\nWALTER: Well, he certainly looks that.\nBROYLES: You believe he might be older.\nWALTER: Well, given the environmental conditions... the lack of oxygen and light... and their impact on his biological development, he could be significantly older.\nOLIVIA: But none of that explains how he knew Samantha Gilmore.\nWALTER: No. That I can't explain. But good news, Mister Broyles, I have located my turntable, so I don't need you to purchase me one after all. It was under the sink in the john. So obvious. I was sitting on the toilet, and I...\nPETER: Walter, I think that's probably enough information.\nAGENT #2: (enters the room with a fax) Agent Dunham. We just got another one. The artist is going after another victim.\nKATE HARPER: (walking her pet near a park) Easy, easy.\nTHE ARTIST: (approaching politely) That's a beautiful dog.\nKATE HARPER: Thank you.\nTHE ARTIST: Is he friendly?\nKATE HARPER: Of course. His name's Mack.\nTHE ARTIST: (kneels to greet the animal, smiles at Kate) Hey, Mack. Hey, Mackie. (pets the dog) Hi, Mack.\nOLIVIA: Hey. (knocks on the door, sits on the edge of the bed) They, uh... they told me that you haven't eaten anything solid yet. (pours some candies into her hand) So I, uh... I thought that you might like these more than the mystery meat. (tastes a candy) When I was a kid, I used to live on these. Except the yellow. Something about the color. Reminded me of medicine. You wanna try one? (the Child picks a candy up and studies it) That's it. Good. (he feeds it to Olivia) Thank you. Ahem. Yesterday you wrote down a name for me. (takes out her notebook) Remember? I thought today you could give me your name.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (walking in the room) You have a real way with him. Elliot Michaels. Department of Social Services.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Olivia Dunham, FBI.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (to the Child) Um, you mind if I borrow Miss Dunham for a few minutes? I promise I'll bring her right back.\nOLIVIA: (to the Child) I'll be just outside.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (in the hallway) Dr. Winick brought me up to speed about your interest in the boy's case.\nOLIVIA: The circumstances by which he was found attracted our interest.\nELIOT MICHAELS: It's bizarre, huh? Have you been able to find out anything more about him? You know, first name, where he's from...\nOLIVIA: Uh, no. I'm afraid not yet.\nELIOT MICHAELS: Well, I'm not gonna get in your way. I just thought I'd stop by and see him before I get the ball rolling.\nOLIVIA: How so?\nELIOT MICHAELS: How so? Uh, well, you know... physically, it... it doesn't seem as if there's anything really wrong with him, so I've arranged to have him moved.\nOLIVIA: Moved?\nELIOT MICHAELS: To a facility that can provide the treatment he needs.\nOLIVIA: When?\nELIOT MICHAELS: Tomorrow. You know, I hope. Assuming all the paperwork is in order.\n(the Child starts growing concerned, convulsing slightly, his monitor beeps, the nurse runs in the room followed by Olivia)\nOLIVIA: What's wrong?\nNURSE: Uh, I'm not sure. His BP and his heart rate are spiking.\nOLIVIA: (calming the Child) It's okay, it's okay. Hey. It's okay. Shh. It's gonna be okay. Oh... Good...\nNURSE: (to Olivia) Should I get the doctor?\nOLIVIA: I... I think we're okay.\nELIOT MICHAELS: You okay, there?\nOLIVIA: Maybe if you just, uh, gave us a moment.\nELIOT MICHAELS: Of course. Just take your time.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (on cell phone walking down the hall) I'm at the hospital. I think we may have found another one.\nOLIVIA: (sitting bedside) I should let you get some rest.\nTHE CHILD: (takes pen and paper, studies Olivia's face and writes inverted '547 Marlborough')\nOLIVIA: Anything so far?\nCHARLIE: I just got here five seconds ago. So what's the plan? Start knocking on doors?\nOLIVIA: Unless you can think of a better idea.\nCHARLIE: Alright. You go East, I take West.\nOLIVIA: OK.\n(in a nearby van, parked just to the East)\nTHE ARTIST: (whispers to Kate Harper as she whimpers) Shh, shh, shh... Shh... Shh, shh, shh.\n(after Olivia moves away from the van)\nTHE ARTIST: (to Kate Harper) Good. You are very good.\nRACHEL: (joins a seated Olivia in the kitchen) Mind some company?\nOLIVIA: Of course not.\nRACHEL: Did I miss you last night, or did you not even come home?\nOLIVIA: Uh, no. You didn't miss me. (sips her cocktail)\nRACHEL: Have you eaten anything?\nOLIVIA: Uh, M & M's.\nRACHEL: Liv... Do you like it? Your job?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Most days. Today, not so much. I followed a lead that didn't pan out. What about you? Why are you up?\nRACHEL: Um...\nOLIVIA: (to Rachel) I'm sorry. (answers her cell phone) Hello.\nCHARLIE: (from the crime scene) We found our second victim. It's Kate Harper.\nOLIVIA: Where?\nCHARLIE: (walking outside of the church) She's right outside St. Catherine's. Surrounded by candles. Good news is we might have finally caught a break. E.R.T. said they found some blood underneath her nails. So they're running it.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I'll be right in.\nCHARLIE: Just one more thing, Liv. The address the boy gave us. A little while after we left, a neighbor found a dog tied to a fence. It was whimpering. It was the victim's dog.\nOLIVIA: We were there.\nCHARLIE: There's no way we could've known, Liv.\nOLIVIA: But he was trying to tell us, and he was right, and we were there?\nPETER: (knocking on the bathroom door) Walter. Olivia's here. She needs to talk to ya. Walter.\nWALTER: Could she come back later? I'm about to step in the bath.\nPETER: No, she can't come back later. It's the middle of the night. She needs to talk to you right now.\nWALTER: (opens the door and exits) Honestly, Peter, can't a man get a... Agent Dunham. Peter, why didn't you tell me Agent Dunham was here?\nPETER: I'm pretty sure I did.\nWALTER: Well, what can I do for you?\nOLIVIA: Walter, it turns out the boy was right. He gave me a clue, but I didn't know what I was looking for. So do you have any thoughts at all? Any idea how I can reach him or how he's doing any of this?\nWALTER: I... I believe I know how he's doing it. Since he's been living underground for so long, His hypersensitivity to light and sound... it's just possible he may also be sensitive to people's emotions. A raw nerve. Able to intuit the feelings and intentions of others. Your killer, for one.\nOLIVIA: So are you saying that he's psychic?\nWALTER: No, no. More a shark.\nPETER: A shark?\nWALTER: Specifically, their electromagnetic field, which allows them to detect their prey's bioelectric field from a distance of many miles. We humans have it too, of course. Pheromones. Undetectable chemicals that nonetheless affect our behavior, our sex drive...\nPETER: Hey, speaking of sex drive (chiding his father for his loose robe).\nWALTER: Oh, Peter, don't be such a prude. I'm sure Agent Dunham knows what a penis looks like. Don't you, Agent Dunham?\nPETER: My father, ladies and gentlemen.\nOLIVIA: (continues unphased) But how would he know things that I don't? Know about the killer or victims that he's never even met?\nWALTER: My dear, there is much that is unexplained. Until it is.\nPETER: In short, he has no idea.\nOLIVIA: Even if you're right, and he can sense the killer, he can't tell me that. Not in a way that I could do anything about it.\nWALTER: Well, if that's the problem, then there's no problem.\nPETER: What does that mean?\nWALTER: Well, the boy is obviously thinking, yes? Having thoughts. We just haven't been able to hear them.\nPETER: And I'm sure you can do that, can't you? Hear his thoughts?\nWALTER: Perhaps I can.\nOLIVIA: (walks in to visit the Child and notices the yellow candy arranged in the shape of an arrow or pine tree) Wow. Did you make this? Hey. Listen, I wanna take you away from here for a while. Is that okay?\nASTRID: (showing the Child some on-line cartoons) Vintage bugs bunny. Didn't get any better than this, right?\nWALTER: (finds a suitcase in the backroom) Aha! I found it! Neural stimulator... is there anything it can't do?\nOLIVIA: Walter, is that what you're gonna use to read the boy's thoughts?\nWALTER: Not to read them, my dear. To listen to them.\nPETER: I wish you would have told us that that's what you were gonna use.\nWALTER: Why?\nPETER: 'Cause you coulda saved us the hassle you're not putting that medieval torture device on that poor kid.\nOLIVIA: Walter, the last time you used that thing, you drilled it into the guy's head.\nWALTER: If you think he'll find it disagreeable... I suppose it could be modified.\nPETER: Really? You didn't think to mention that to the last guy?\nWALTER: It shouldn't be too much trouble. We merely need to intercept the neural responses from the speech centers of he boy's brain, which can be achieved by placing electrodes in the halo ring. After that, it's simply a matter of synthesizing the impulses. Think of it as creating artificial vocal cords.\nPETER: Simple. Like makin' an omelet.\nWALTER: Actually, son, a good omelet is far more complex. Eh? We'll have him talking in no time.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (walking into the room) Where's the child that was in this room?\nNURSE: (changing bed sheets) He was discharged.\nELIOT MICHAELS: By whom?\nOLIVIA: (assuring the child) Just remember that you don't have to do anything that you don't wanna do. If for a second you're scared, or you don't like what's happening, You just squeeze my hand like that. Okay?\nWALTER: Is he ready?\nOLIVIA: As ready as he'll ever be. I guess.\nPETER: I've seen that look before. Usually right before somebody throws up.\nWALTER: Agent Farnsworth, ready?\nPETER: Walter, what're you doing?\nWALTER: Watch and learn, son. (starts dancing to the music holding the neural halo)\nMUSIC: # Love and happiness # Wait a minute # Something's going wrong # Someone's on the phone # three o'clock in the morning # Yeah # Talkin' 'bout #\nWALTER: Ooh (the Child smiles as Walter dons the halo)\nMUSIC: # She can make it right # Well # Happiness is when # You really feel good about somebody # There's nothing wrong # being in love with someone # Yeah # Yeah, oh, baby #\nOLIVIA: Nicely done, Walter. (as he places the halo on the Childs head)\nMUSIC: # Love and happiness # Love and happiness # Love and happiness #\nWALTER: You can turn the music off now, Agent Farworth. (the Child grips Olivia's hand and appears wary) What's wrong?\nELIOT MICHAELS: (barging into the lab with Broyles in-tow)) What's going on in here?\n(in an inner office)\nELIOT MICHAELS: Did you really think you could just steal a child out of protective custody and that somehow no one would notice?\nOLIVIA: Look, first of all, I didn't steal him. The child's assisting us in an active criminal investigation.\nELIOT MICHAELS: Assisting you how?\nOLIVIA: No offense, Mr. Michaels, but that's classified information. The Department of Social Services doesn't have clearance to know that... (Michaels raises his eyebrows) What?\nBROYLES: (stares at Michaels and turns to Olivia) Mr. Michaels isn't Social Services. He's with the C.I.A.'s Directorate of Science and Technology.\nELIOT MICHAELS: I'd have told you earlier myself, but you don't have clearance to know that.\nBROYLES: This morning we were informed the D.S.N.T. will be taking full custody of the child.\nOLIVIA: So they can what? Study him?\n(the Child studies the conversation from his bed in the lab)\nELIOT MICHAELS: This child was apparently able to survive for years, underground, in an oxygen-deprived environment with no food or water. Surely you could see how someone who doesn't have his best interests at heart might want to exploit that.\nOLIVIA: Oh, so you wanna take him to protect him, is that it? Forgive me for sounding harsh, but I don't buy that for a second.\nBROYLES: Dunham.\nELIOT MICHAELS: It's alright. To be honest, it really doesn't make any difference what you think. the boy's coming with me.\nBROYLES: I'm afraid this is above both of us.\nASTRID: (walking into the office) Agent Francis just called. He said we got another invitation... from The Artist.\nBROYLES: Mr. Michaels, suppose you give us one day.\nELIOT MICHAELS: A day?\nBROYLES: He could help us catch a murderer and save a life. The boy would be under my protection. I'll personally guarantee his safety.\nELIOT MICHAELS: If I agree to this, then you'll turn the boy over to me without a fight? Do we have an agreement?\nBROYLES: We do.\nWALTER: (talking to himself) My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pies. No. That's the planets of the solar system... or at least was.\nPETER: (distracting the Child) You wanna take a look at this? His name is Roadblock. He's not really one of your top-tier G.I. Joes, but it is the best we had. Huh. It's funny, I always remember the scar being on the other side. You want him?\nWALTER: Cannot Build Phallic Puzzles In The Lab.\nPETER: What is he doing?\nASTRID: Mnemonics. You know, like a rhyme or phrase to help memory. Like, uh, \"H-O-M-E-S\" stands for the Great Lakes. That's Huron...\nPETER: I'm familiar with it. Why is he doing it?\nASTRID: Well, he is trying to remember which wires go into which connections on the machine.\nOLIVIA: (on phone) Yeah, thanks, Charlie. I will. Keep me posted.\nPETER: (walks over to Olivia) More bad news?\nOLIVIA: We got the forensics report. We were hoping that the blood we found under the second victim's fingernails was a match for the killer.\nPETER: But no?\nOLIVIA: Not unless Gene is the killer. It wasn't human, it was bovine.\nGENE: moo...\nASTRID: You said cow blood?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, and some plastic polymers.\nASTRID: How would someone get cow's blood on their fingers in Boston?\nOLIVIA: Astrid, could you contact the Bureau of Animal Health? We should start pulling livestock licenses around Boston. Petting farms, research facilities, anything.\nASTRID: Yeah. Gotcha. (walks away to start researching)\nWALTER: (to himself loudly) She's a bad mamma jamma! Ha! Alpha, beta, beta and gamma... She's - A - Bad - Mamma - Jamma. Signal - Amplification - Bifurcation - Modulation - Juxtaposition. (fades - ... \"vocal - linguistic - impulses\")\nOLIVIA: (to the Child) You hanging in there, kiddo? Yeah, me too.\nWALTER: Peter, get me the red wires. Peter.\nPETER: Here's a thought. A couple years ago, I was working down in Tennessee as a floor sweeper at a meat-packing plant.\nASTRID: Sounds awesome.\nPETER: You have no idea. My point is we had these big rolls of industrial-grade plastic that we used to wrap their cuts of meat in before we would send them to the grocery stores.\nOLIVIA: Cow's blood in plastic.\nPETER: Yeah.\n(Olivia treks off to a series of local meat-packing plants)\nWALTER: (finishes preparing the Child with the neural halo) Okay. I believe we're ready. Peter.\nPETER: Yeah. (adjusts switch and dials)\nWALTER: Ah. Yes. Listen to that.\nPETER: Listen to what, Walter? That's just random noise.\nWALTER: No, that's just the computer calibrating the signal to noise ratio. Adjust the attenuation setting to seventy decibels.\nASTRID: (audio is slightly clearer) Okay, that sounds a little more like a voice.\nWALTER: Yes, now, the sound pressure level. Eh, dial the audio meter to fifteen hundred hertz. Slower, damn it, go slower.\nPETER: Okay, if you wanna do this yourself, feel free.\nWALTER: (to Peter) No, there. (urgently to Astrid) Astro, quickly, get me a tape recorder.\nPETER: (the Child starts to shiver uncontrollably) Walter, turn the machine off right now. Turn it off now. He's freezing. Help me get this off of him. Hey, Astrid, can you grab us a blanket?\nWALTER: Alright, free in the front.\nASTRID: Here.\nPETER: Alright, we're gonna get you warmed up.\nWALTER: Doesn't make any sense. If anything, brain activity should generate heat.\nOLIVIA: (shivering in a meat locker as she interviews a supervisor) We're trying to track down a suspect in a murder investigation.\nARCHIE WU: What, you mean the guy on the news... who killed those girls?\nOLIVIA: We're not sure. Maybe. But any past or present employees that stick out to you? Like antisocial behavior or a history of violent incidences here at work?\nARCHIE WU: No. They're good men. Hard workers.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna need a copy of your employee records, regardless.\nARCHIE WU: Okay.\nOLIVIA: And also a sample of your shipping plastic.\nARCHIE WU: Plastic? Why?\nOLIVIA: It could be an element in our investigation. Will that be a problem?\nARCHIE WU: No, but...\nOLIVIA: Mr. Wu?\nARCHIE WU: A man came in here yesterday, and I... I sold him some plastic.\n(a grade school is letting out and the bus is filling with students a female teacher with an arm load of school work heads to her vehicle when a gentlemen offers to help)\nTHE ARTIST: (politely) Allow me.\nOLDER WOMAN: Oh, thank you. (opens the trunk to her car) Your mother raised you well.\nOLIVIA: (on the phone leaving the neat-packing plant) Hey, Peter, it's me. I'm just leaving. So, how's the boy? Has Walter made any progress?\nPETER: (on the phone from the lab) Hard to say - we heard something, but I don't know if it was the kid trying to talk. Look, I don't want you to get upset about this because he is fine, but something kinda weird did happen.\nOLIVIA: Weird how?\nPETER: Well, he started shivering all of the sudden. Like, the temperature dropped thirty degrees, except it didn't.\nOLIVIA: Is he sick?\nPETER: No, he seems fine. We got him wrapped up in a blanket. He's doing okay. How 'bout you? You find anything?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, looks like the artist bought some plastic from a slaughterhouse in Roxbury. I got his sketch, all thanks to you.\nPETER: (walks into the main lab area) Hey, guys. We got good news.\nASTRID: What's that?\nPETER: Turns out the plastic did come from a meat packing plant. Olivia got a sketch of the guy. (to Olivia) What about you? You gonna go back to the FBI, or you coming here?\nWALTER: Ask her if it was refrigerated.\nPETER: Hold on a second.\nWALTER: Peter! Ask her if the plant was refrigerated.\nPETER: It's a meat packing plant full of raw meat. So yeah, let's go out on a limb here and say that it's probably refrigerated. What does that even matter?\nWALTER: Because that explains everything.\nASTRID: Walter, slow down. You're not making any sense.\nWALTER: Of course I am. The boy... our strange, little friend... is an empath.\nPETER: Yes. He senses other people's emotions. You already said that, Walter.\n(Olivia returns to the lab, the Child pets Gene as the science team talks at the opposite end of the hallway)\nOLIVIA: Go on, Walter, what are you saying?\nWALTER: That he's capable of making connections... emotional connections. Uh, to a construction worker who found him, the killer, but most importantly, he is emotionally bonded to you, Agent Dunham. That's why he's telling you about the crimes. Because he knows that the information is important to you. He's trying to help you.\nOLIVIA: (studies the Child, walks toward him and sits nearby) Are you trying to help me? That man who's been hurting people is going to hurt someone else unless I stop him. Do you know who he is? Can you tell me anything about him?\nPETER: Maybe he doesn't know.\nASTRID: Or he can't control the Ability all the time.\nWALTER: Perhaps a small electric shock to kick-start things.\nOLIVIA: No. It's something different. It's like he's mad at me.\nASTRID: Because he doesn't wanna leave.\nOLIVIA: What?\nASTRID: Well, you told Michaels that once the boy helped you stop the Artist, you'd turn him over to him.\nWALTER: He heard you. Or, more accurately, felt you.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. I've been so caught up in what I needed that I forgot how strange this must seem to you. And I know how scared you must be, but I need your help again. I can't even stop them from taking you. Even though I wish I could. And if you really can feel what I'm thinking... you know how much I mean that.\n(the Child writes out another lead for Olivia - 'York\/Glenway')\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (approaches driver seated in stopped vehicle) Nice car, sir. Where ya headed?\nDRIVER: Uh, home. I was out to dinner.\nCHARLIE: (from behind the vehicle) Open the trunk, please. (inspects trunk of sedan) It's clear.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience. (waves the vehicle through as a van pulls to a stop for inspection)\nTHE ARTIST: What's going on, officer?\nOLIVIA: What are you doing in the neighborhood, sir?\nTHE ARTIST: I... just, uh, coming home from work. Haven't had anything to drink. Would you mind if I ask what you... what you're looking for?\nOLIVIA: (after reviewing her sketch of the suspect) Uh, I'm sorry. We're not allowed to say.\n(Olivia notices a yellow tree-shaped air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror, and suddenly has memory flashes of the yellow candy as The Child arranged it... in the shape of a tree.)\n(then, more suspiciously) Sir, we need to check the back of your vehicle.\n(the Artist speeds away and Olivia fires her pistol repeatedly at the vehicle. she runs after it. after the van nearly collides with another vehicle and stops in the bushes, the Artist runs away. Olivia pursues.)\nOLIVIA: Charlie! Check the back of the van!\n(the chase continues through the dark alleys and over a fence)\nCHARLIE: (on his radio at the back door to the van) Liv, it's him. We found the victim. She's alive.\n(the chase continues into a cemetery along a row of crypts. pistol drawn, Olivia stalks the hiding criminal. he jumps from the shadows and knocks the pistol from her hands. he attempts to stab her and during the fist fight, she turns his knife on him and stabs him. she retrieves her pistol as Charlie runs to her aid.)\nCHARLIE: You alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. (exasperated) Oh, god.\nCHARLIE: (checks the criminal for a pulse, then, into his radio) This is Francis. I need E.M.S. at the cemetery behind the 1600 block of York.\nBROYLES: (answers phone in his office) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: (driving her vehicle) It's Olivia. I need you to help me with something.\nDOCTOR WINICK: (explaining to an assistant) Here. Here. And then we just do the blood work, okay?\nOLIVIA: Excuse me, Dr. Winick?\nDOCTOR WINICK: Yes.\nOLIVIA: I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment.\nDOCTOR WINICK: Sure.\nOLIVIA: Hi. (entering with Winick)\nWALTER: Hi.\nWALTER: (Peter returns with the child) I think you'll find he's doing much better.\nOLIVIA: (to the child) Hi. (takes jacket from Peter) Oh, thank you. (to the child) You remember Dr. Winick. She's gonna take you now. But not to a facility. She's gonna take you to a home. With a very nice family that are gonna take care of you. And keep you safe. (they study one another)\nDOCTOR WINICK: We should go now.\nOLIVIA: (a kiss to the child's forehead) Bye.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (standing toe-to-toe) What do you mean he's gone?\nBROYLES: I'm sorry, Mr. Michaels.\nELIOT MICHAELS: Gone where?\nBROYLES: Well, that's what we can't figure out. He disappeared from right under the noses of a protective detail.\nELIOT MICHAELS: How is that possible? He's just a kid.\nBROYLES: Yes. A kid who, as you said yourself, lived his entire life underground, which still begs the question... how he got there in the first place? I'm beginning to suspect there's a lot about him we don't understand. And apparently we never will.\nELIOT MICHAELS: (smiles. smirks. walks out of the office)\nRACHEL: (wrestling on the couch with her daughter) You said it!\nELLA: No! I didn't! I didn't say it!\nRACHEL: Yes you did, you cheater!\nELLA: Waah!\nRACHEL: Hi, Liv.\nELLA: Mommy is so bad at \"Simon Says\" she won't even do what I say.\nRACHEL: Four years old and she's drunk with power. (play tickling) I have created a monster!\nELLA: Do you wanna play with us?\nRACHEL: Oh, don't do that. Let Aunt Liv rest.\nOLIVIA: Sure. (sits down)\nELLA: I'm Simon.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nELLA: \"Simon Says\" - put your hands in the air.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (both women raise their arms)\nELLA: Touch your nose. (Olivia touches her nose) You lose. (everyone laughs) Again! Again!\n(as Doctor Winick drives, The Child sits in the back seat and marvels at the world as it passes by him. the marvel goes out of his face as they drive by The Observer, walking on a nearby snow-covered sidewalk. both empaths turn and stare at one another, continuing on their separate ways)"

Bear, Bear, stop right there. There's a monster up ahead.\nRACHEL: (coming in from the adjacent room) Okay, bedtime.\nELLA: No, no, this is the last book.\nRACHEL: Oh, I thought that the last book - was the last book.\nOLIVIA: We are almost done.\nRACHEL: You guys work well together, and I don't like it.\nOLIVIA: (answers ringing phone) Hello.\nPETER: (from the lab) Hey, it's Peter.\nOLIVIA: Hi. What's wrong?\nPETER: What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: Is there something wrong?\nPETER: No. Why, what's wrong with you?\nOLIVIA: Uh, nothing. I assumed there was an emergency.\nPETER: Nope. no emergency.\nOLIVIA: What's up?\nPETER: Nothing, I was actually calling for Rachel, is she there?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Actually, it's kinda stupid. I can call back later if you guys are in the middle of something.\nOLIVIA: No, no, she's right here. Uh, Rach, it's for you. It's Peter.\nRACHEL: Oh. (takes phone) Hey. (listens) Yeah, did you remember it or not? (laughs) Are you serious? (walks to other room) What is it?\nELLA: Aunt Liv, can we keep on going?\nRACHEL: (in background) ...no, never...\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nRACHEL: (in background) Alright, hold on. (loudly to Peter) Hold on a second. Hold on.\nOLIVIA: uh. But I don't see any monster, the Bear said. and he kept walking because he didn't believe there was a monster up ahead.\nELLA: Aunt Liv?\nOLIVIA: Yeah?\nELLA: Monsters aren't real, right?\nOLIVIA: No, Sweetheart. They're not.\n(the cages are rattling and the lab animals are upset when four young criminals break into the testing facility and begin to vandalize the property, destroy equipment, spray graffiti on the walls and release the caged animals)\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: The cameras are dark.\nMIT GUY #1: Let's go. We gotta move.\nJONATHAN SWIFT: I told you, relax. The alarm's disabled.\nMIT GUY #1: There might be a backup system.\nJONATHAN SWIFT: No, there isn't. I checked all the security. Why don't you finish up in here? I want to see what's behind this door. (breaks a lock an trips a silent alarm at a nearby private residence)\n(the geneticist responsible for much of the advanced research at the lab, Cameron Deglmann, is awoken by a noisy text message reporting the crime at Swift Research. he races there in a vehicle)\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: (eager to leave the crime scene) Come on, Jonathan. We've gotta get outta here.\nJONATHAN SWIFT: Hold on a second. (walks to a large metal door at the back of the area, opens it and hears a deep growl)\nCAMERON DEGLMANN: (after racing through the night, he pulls up in a vehicle. enters through the shipping doors in his pajamas and robe. with a flashlight and drawn pistol, he confronts the intruders) Stop right there!\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: You should be arrested for what you do. We let them all go. All of them. These animals deserve better. How would you like to be caged up and tortured? (the security responder sees that the once locked metal door is wide open and walks to it, concerned. he is followed with) Shame on you for what you do. These are living creatures and you murder them. You're a killer.\nCAMERON DEGLMANN: Tell me you didn't open that door in there.\nJONATHAN SWIFT: Yeah, you bet I did.\nCAMERON DEGLMANN: (completely panicky) Get out now! All of you! Get out! (walks into room)\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: You should be arrested. Experimenting on animals is a crime.\nCAMERON DEGLMANN: Somebody shut her up! (as he is grabbed violently from behind... returning for a second, vomiting blood)\nCHRIS HAWKINS: Let's go! let's go! (foursome runs from the lab) Let's go. come on! (Jonathan is grabbed from behind as they start to exit the facility. he is dragged back inside)\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: Jonathan!\nCHRIS HAWKINS: Let's go. come on, go!\n(the trio races away into the night in a vehicle)\nMIT GUY #1: What the hell was that?\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: That thing, that thing grabbed that guy.\nMIT GUY #1: I'm freaking out, man. What do we do? Do we call the police?\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: We can't leave Jonathan. We have to go back.\nCHRIS HAWKINS: No, no, no.\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: This is crazy. This is crazy. (screams as the car lurches) What is that?\nCHRIS HAWKINS: I don't know! I can't see anything!\n(the vehicle departs the road and rolls through the woods)\nLAUREN CHAPMAN: (to her silent cohort as he bleeds from the mouth) Chris?\nMIT GUY #1: What did that?\n(inverted and trapped in the backseat, she screams as she sees a beast charging at her from outside the car)\nPETER (entering lab to Astrid): One cream, one sugar.\nASTRID: Thank you, Peter.\n(Peter walks over to what appears to be an omelet lying on a plate and starts to cut a piece.)\nWALTER: Peter, no!\nPETER: Walter, we talked about sharing.\nWALTER: That's not to eat. you've ruined it.\nPETER: It's an omelet.\nWALTER: It's not an omelet! (lifts top of item to display an ear)\nPETER: Oh, my--ugh! Walter, why is there an ear in the omelet?\nWALTER: It was an experiment. It was a protein-rich incubator. It was growing.\nPETER: It was growing? That's perfect.\nWALTER: No, it's not perfect. You just ruined it. And you could have died, had you eaten it.\nASTRID (answers ringing phone): Hello? (listens) Really?\nPETER: You know, maybe in the future you could do me a favor and just put a sign warning me not to confuse your toxic playthings with breakfast.\nWALTER: Maybe you should get your own breakfast and not poach mine.\nPETER: That is hardly the point. Remember yesterday when I nearly washed my face in a sink full of acid? Or three days ago you hooked Gene up to the solar panels and I nearly electrocuted myself.\nWALTER: This is a lab. You're the one who should be careful. I trust you look both ways when you cross the street.\nPETER: Yeah, but the difference being that if I don't, I'm the only one who gets flattened. You, Walter, you live in a society with other people.\nASTRID: Hey.\nPETER: What?!\nASTRID: That was Olivia.\nBROYLES: Local P.D. found the vehicle a couple hours ago. Three bodies inside two male,one female.\nOLIVIA: And the cause of death?\nBROYLES: They appear to have been attacked by an animal, but the coroner's never seen anything like it. Whatever did this doesn't appear to be indigenous to the area.\nCHARLIE: Well,wherever it is indigenous to, I don't wanna live there.\nWALTER: Oh, interesting.\nPETER: Some would say disgusting.\nWALTER: Whatever did this had enormous claws, like those of a bear or of one of the big cats. -- The spread of the digits, v-shaped. -- It's too wide for one of those creatures. -- Configuration closer to that of an eagle -- Of course much,much larger.\nPETER: Hey, we're looking for big bird.\nWALTER: Don't be ridiculous. Perhaps a pterodactyl...\nOLIVIA: Have evidence techs bag their I.D.s?\nCHARLIE: No, I don't think they were carrying any.\nOLIVIA: Maybe this is why.\nCHARLIE: That's a Brockhage lock pick gun,\nPETER: They work great. A little bulky for my taste,but--\nCHARLIE: Looks like these kids were out for more than a joyride.\nWALTER: Mmm, this is quite delicious.\nPETER: Where did you get that?\nWALTER: In the car,uneaten.\nPETER: What is the matter with you?\nWALTER: Oh,forgive my son. He's been in a mood all day.\nPETER: I just figured \"don't eat the evidence\", went without saying.\nWALTER: I assure you it has no bearing on the case.\nOLIVIA (Peers into vehicle and sees drink cups): Four drinks.\nCHARLIE: Three bodies.\nOLIVIA: There were four people in this group.\nCHARLIE: We're missing a body.\nOLIVIA (To Broyles): Have we searched the woods?\nBROYLES: We had canine units canvass the area. We didn't turn up any other bodies.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe one of them got away and survived.\nBROYLES: If they did, they could answer a lot of questions.\nCHARLIE: I'm gonna check local hospitals, see if the emergency room has anything that lines up with an animal attack.\nPETER: All this stuff is from Junkie Genie's. It's a fast food joint up by M.I.T. Food is crap. But it's cheap, and it's open late. So it's always filled with undergrads.\nBROYLES: I thought you falsified your degree from M.I.T.\nWALTER: Yeah, Peter, why commit to anything when you can just fake it?\nPETER: I spent some nights there.\nOLIVIA: Maybe we should go through the student database and see if we can I.D. any of the victims.\nOLIVIA: I understand Chris Hawkins lives here. (Displays credentials) Olivia Dunham, FBI.\nCARL BUSSLER: Yeah, um, Chris isn't here.\nOLIVIA: I know, but would you mind if I ask you a few questions?\nCARL BUSSLER: I'm Carl. And no, I would love it. Come on in.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(Olivia enters the living room and sees a clear plastic pipe)\nCARL BUSSLER: Oh, yeah, that isn't mine. That was left here by a stranger. Can I get you something? Orange juice? candy?\nOLIVIA: How 'bout some pants?\nCARL BUSSLER: Yeah, I can do that.\n(Carl slips into a pair of trousers.)\nOLIVIA: So how well do you know Chris?\nCARL BUSSLER: Oh,you know,okay. Kinda, \"Hey, how's it going?\" \"nice,whatever.\" \"what's for dinner?\" That kinda stuff. Why, is he in some kind of trouble?\nOLIVIA: I'm not at liberty to say.\nCARL BUSSLER: Oh, no, no, no. Just 'cause he doesn't seem like the type, you know,to get into FBI kinda trouble.\nOLIVIA: Why do you say that?\nCARL BUSSLER: He's always making fliers, going to rallies. You know, political.\nOLIVIA: So what kinda causes?\nCARL BUSSLER: It's really just the one. Uh, \"Animals Forever,\" I think it's called. Or, no, no, no. \"Animals First.\"\nOLIVIA: He was an animal rights activist?\nCARL BUSSLER: Yeah, definitely. He'd save anything with a beak or a claw.\nASTRID: Jeez. Whatever got to him had some pretty nasty claws.\nWALTER: Ooh, Ooh. And some very large fangs.\nPETER: What is that?\nWALTER: Punctures from the fangs of most likely some type of viper.\nASTRID: So this thing had the claws of a lion and the fangs of a snake?\nWALTER: It reminds me of a woman I once knew in Cleveland.\nPETER: Walter, these punctures are over four inches apart. and that would make this snake eight-feet long.\nWALTER: Her name was Harriet something.\nOLIVIA: How is everything?\nPETER: Well, apparently you're looking for a lion-snake named Harriet.\nPETER: Did you find anything at M.I.T.?\nOLIVIA: Yeah,the victims were all animal rights activists, A group called \"Animals First.\"\nPETER: So you think that they were breaking into labs that were doing animal testing?\nOLIVIA: And releasing the animals, which would explain the burglary tools and the lack of I.D.\nPETER: It would, but it wouldn't explain how whatever it is that these guys released was able to rip a door off their car and kill 'em all.\nOLIVIA: Walter, have you got any idea what kind of animal would be in a lab that could do this?\nWALTER: Well, judging by the wounds, I'd say two or three different ones actually.\nPETER: Right, a motley crew of lab animals got together and decided to exact their revenge on mankind.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, let's look up labs in the area that do research with animals and--\nASTRID: See if any of them reported break-ins? Yep, I'm on it.\n(Walter continues his examination of a corpse. He removes a spine from one of the wounds and examines it.)\nWALTER: Oh,no.\n(Animal control vehicle pulls off road.)\nANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER 1: This is unit 81 responding to the...monster sighting on route 30.\nDISPATCHER (On Radio): Roger that,81.\n(Animal control officers exit their vehicle.)\nANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER 1: It's always a monster. Monster must be housewife for raccoon.\nANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER 2: You hear that?\n(Animal control officers move toward a growling sound.)\nPETER: Any leads on the fourth victim?\nOLIVIA: No.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: Nothing. You called Rachel last night - anything important?\nPETER: Hardly. You know that song \"If you like pina coladas?\" We were trying to remember the name. It turns out it's called \"Escape.\"\nOLIVIA: So you two are friends now?\nPETER: Does that bother you?\nOLIVIA: (unconvincingly) No. (Peter grins as Olivia answers her ringing phone) Hey, Charlie, what's up?\nWALTER: (looking though some of his old files) Oh, good heavens.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, Charlie just called. Animal control got a call from a woman in Newton who claims that she nearly hit a monster on Route 30. So I'm gonna go meet him there. Will you call me if you find anything?\nASTRID: Ah, sure thing.\nOLIVIA: Thanks.\nWALTER: Olivia, be careful.\nOLIVIA: (as she leaves) Thank you, Walter.\nPETER: What was that all about?\nWALTER: Nothing. Just want her to be safe.\n(Charlie Francis approaches the animal control truck in his vehicle. He exits the vehicle.)\nCHARLIE: Hello?\n(Charlie approaches the truck and opens the driver side door. He sees the mauled body of one of the animal control officers and calls a number on phone.)\nCHARLIE: This is Francis. I need medevac teams and backup sent to my location.\n(Charlie draws his weapons and proceeds into the woods, where he finds the body of the second animal control officer. As Charlie looks around, the tail of the unknown beast descends from above him. The camera cuts to Olivia arriving at the scene. She hears shots being fired. She draws her weapons and runs toward the sound.)\nOLIVIA: Charlie? Charlie?\n(Olivia finds Charlie under a tree.)\nOLIVIA: Charlie. How bad is it?\nCHARLIE: I don't know. Uh, I'm alright.\nOLIVIA: What was it?\nCHARLIE: Big.\nOLIVIA: Uhh\nPETER: What the heck is that? (as the EMT pulls a quill from Charlie's chest)\nWALTER: (barking at the EMT) Put the stinger in here, please. Now, please, in here. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nEMT: Agent. I'd like you to get that eyed down at the hospital.\nCHARLIE: No, thanks. It won't be necessary.\nWALTER: Agent Francis, I'm told you were attacked by the beast. What did it feel like?\nCHARLIE: It hurt.\nWALTER: No, I mean the animal's dermis. Was it rough like a rhinoceros?\nCHARLIE: I haven't felt any rhinos lately. But, uh, it was course like sandpaper.\nWALTER: And the metasoma, the tail, was it segmented like a scorpion?\nCHARLIE: I didn't get a good look at it. It kept on knocking me on my ass.\nWALTER: Perhaps you did,you just can't remember. Trauma can do that. I could hypnotize you --\nOLIVIA: Walter, I think that that's enough for the moment.\nWALTER: But it would be very helpful to identify the traits.\nPETER: Are you okay? Did you take something?\nWALTER: Psychedelics? No, not since Thursday, no.\nOLIVIA: Walter, why don't you share what you're thinking?\nWALTER: I believe we may be dealing with a transgenic species.\nOLIVIA: Which is what?\nWALTER: It's an animal creation. Um, an organism made up of the genes of multiple species. The best of the best, as it were.\nOLIVIA: You're saying that you think the creature is man-made?\nWALTER: Accelerated Darwinism.\nOLIVIA: Is that even possible?\nWALTER: In theory, yes. Although one would have to solve many problems -- Incompatible species, Massive mutual rejection, similar to when a transplant recipient rejects a donor organ.\nPETER: And there's a reason for that. Mixing a bunch of species to create a franken-rhino Is unnatural And a really bad idea.\nOLIVIA: (answers ringing cell phone) Dunham.\nASTRID: (from the lab) Hey, it's me. Is Charlie alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, he's okay.\nASTRID: Thank god. Okay, um, you wanted me to look into any labs that might house animals near the first crime scene.\nOLIVIA: And?\nROBERT SWIFT: How can I help you, Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Doctor Swift? You could start by telling me what sort of work you do here at Swift Research.\nROBERT SWIFT: Well, we're commissioned by pharmaceutal and cosmetic companies to test their products, to make sure they're safe before using them in human trials.\nOLIVIA: Oh, by uh, testing them on animals first?\nROBERT SWIFT: Well, it's an unfortunate but necessary step. We feel it's better to have an animal experience an allergic reaction to a certain perfume... so that you don't have to.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Doctor Swift. Are you aware that a group of college students were attacked and killed near this facility last night?\nROBERT SWIFT: Attacked? By whom?\nOLIVIA: That's what we're trying to determine. We believe these students may have been -- Are you okay?\nROBERT SWIFT: Um, no, actually. We're three days behind on a deadline. You'll excuse me if I seem insensitive, but what does this have to do with me and this lab?\nOLIVIA: We believe they were animal rights activists. That they were killed after they broke in and released animals from a facility much like you have here.\nROBERT SWIFT: So you're suggesting that a lab animal is responsible?\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe one that was genetically altered? Do you do any of that sort of work here?\nROBERT SWIFT: No, Agent Dunham. I told you we only test products. And what's more, there was no break-in.\nOLIVIA: (sees a painter with a roller brush walk by) Doing some cleanup work?\nROBERT SWIFT: Hundreds of animals in and out of here every week. As I'm sure you can probably imagine, the cleanup never ends.\nOLIVIA: Mind if I take a look?\nROBERT SWIFT: Uh, not to be a rude host, but you actually do need a warrant. Understand that we deal with billion-dollar trade secrets, and I am obligated to respect my clients' confidentiality.\n(Astrid does busy work around the lab as Walter seems to be having a private conversation, with himself)\nWALTER: No, hmm? --- How would we accomplish that? --- Wait, damn it! --- How can I concentrate with you running around?\nASTRID: Walter, are you talking to me?\nWALTER: No, just thinking out loud.\nOLIVIA: (return to the lab) Hey. Walter. Walter, I need you to tell me what exactly you would need to create a genetic hybrid, like specific items, so that I can see if Robert Swift bought any of it.\nWALTER: I would need some sodium bicarbonate. And a house in the country, a place to be alone with my thoughts. Some Mahler for the late nights. And time. A lot of time.\nPETER: I know, it's like he's on another planet. You've seen him. he's been like that all day.\nOLIVIA: But can you focus him?\nPETER: Focusing walter is even at the best of times just a matter of degrees. (hesitates) Okay, fine.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: (pursues him across the lab) Hey, Walter, I need you to step back to the planet Earth for a second and focus on something that isn't about you.\nWALTER: Peter... I'm afraid this is about me, about my work. I found this book among my old files.\nPETER: What is this, Walter? (opens to see sketches of hybrid animals) Olivia, take a look at this. Is this the creature?\nWALTER: No.\nWALTER: But I fear it's quite similar.\nPETER: Where did you get this?\nWALTER: I tried to make it 20 years ago.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying you created this?\nWALTER: Not this one specifically. My experiments were a failure.\nPETER: (angry) You knew. you knew all along. You knew that this was connected to your work, and you knew you had information that could help us, but you kept it to yourself.\nWALTER: My creatures didn't survive. Someone else must have finished my work.\nOLIVIA: Who, Walter? who could have done this? Twenty years ago, who were you working with?\nWALTER: Kelvin Genetics. We were doing classified work for the U. S. Army.\nOLIVIA: I Need a name, Walter.\nASTRID: ...uh, guys.\nOLIVIA: Do you remember anybody specific?\nWALTER: No\nASTRID: Guys. This body is moving.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: He's still alive. Quick, unzip it. They may be suffocating.\nPETER: ugh! Maggots!\nWALTER: No, not maggots. Larvae from the creature.\nOLIVIA: You mean that these are baby monsters?\nWALTER: Yes. We must collect them. Peter, a petri dish. (the thorax of the corpse breaks open and hundreds of maggots spill out)\nWALTER: Make it a bucket.\nASTRID: I'm gonna be sick.\nWALTER: Two buckets.\nOLIVIA: Walter, how is this even possible?\nWALTER: The stinger. It must carry the eggs. It transfers them to a suitable incubator.\nASTRID: What,you mean it plants the eggs when it stings you?\nWALTER: Yeah. it's fascinating.\nOLIVIA: Oh, god. Charlie.\n(a newscaster reports on the TV in the bedroom)\nREPORTER: ...so far there have been three reported sightings in the Greater Boston Area -- Two in Medford and one in Arlington. Authorities advise if you see it or any other wild animal, (a familiar bald character crosses the camerashot) do not try to confront it yourself...\nSONIA FRANCIS: Do you hear this? There's some kind of mountain lion on the loose.\nCHARLIE: Mountain lion?\nSONIA FRANCIS: Yeah, in Boston. Where does a mountain lion come from in Boston.\nCHARLIE: Maybe it escaped from the zoo.\nSONIA FRANCIS: Well, I doubt that, otherwise they would just say so. (crawls in bed)\nREPORTER: ...local authorities advise that if you do spot the mountain lion that you should not try to approach it...\nCHARLIE: Well, baby, that's why you married me.\nSONIA FRANCIS: Why?\nCHARLIE: 'cause I can protect you from all the scary things that are out there.\nSONIA FRANCIS: And, uh, who's gonna protect you?\nCHARLIE: (crawls in bed) I told you, it's just a scrape. Bad guy, broken bottle.\nSONIA FRANCIS: Ohh.\nCHARLIE: Nothing I haven't handled before a dozen times.\nSONIA FRANCIS: Who's that?\nCHARLIE: (answers the ringing doorbell) Liv.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, hey.\nCHARLIE: What's up?\nOLIVIA: ...uh.\nCHARLIE: You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, Charlie, um -- but you may not be.\n(a squeeze bottle full of gel is unceremoniously dumped on Charlie's abdomen)\nWALTER: ... electro-conductive gel for the ultrasound.\nCHARLIE: Enough with the suspense. What is it exactly that we're looking for?\nWALTER: I believe that the stinger we found in you implanted the creature's embryos. I think this is why the creature didn't eat you. I think you may be carrying its offspring.\nCHARLIE: You trying to tell me that I'm pregnant?\nOLIVIA: We're hoping not.\nCHARLIE: (as Walter studies the monitor) So?\nWALTER: (to Astrid) Ten times magnification. (sees the parasitic larvae clearly active) huh.\nCHARLIE: Is that it--\nWALTER: I'm afraid so. (dryly) One small piece of good fortune is the creature doesn't mate in the traditional way.\nPETER: (perturbed) Thanks for that, Walter. That's great bedside manner.\nOLIVIA: So what do we do now?\nWALTER: I don't know. I can't simply remove them. They've already spread throughout his system.\nPETER: Just give me a second Astrid. (walks after his father) Walter. Walter, calm down.\nCHARLIE: (privately) Liv, uh, the other victim. How were these things actually born?\nOLIVIA: It doesn't matter because, um, it's not gonna go that far.\nPETER: Walter, there's gotta be something that you can do, alright? Hey, look at me. You can't check out right now. We cannot let this man die.\nWALTER: Don't you think I know that, Peter? I'm thinking damn it. (observes the wiggling maggots in a jar) Agent Farnsworth, draw 25 milliliters of blood... Peter, get some Trichlorimide.\nPETER: What are you gonna do?\nWALTER: Poison them.\nASTRID: (minutes later, preparing to inject a syringe in Charlies abdomen) This is gonna pinch just a little bit.\nCHARLIE: ohhh... (as the needle enters his side)\nWALTER: Careful Peter, it's highly toxic. (as he handles the poison)\nCHARLIE: (quietly to Olivia) If this doesn't work, how much time do I have?\nOLIVIA: The last victim, we figured twenty-four hours after he was...\nCHARLIE: ...knocked up?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nCHARLIE: So I have about sixteen hours.\nMOM: (mom arrives with her young son, Tuck, for some exercise and fun on a cold dreary day) Slow down, Honey. Careful. Okay, get your toy out. (her cell phone rings, she answers as the boy continues on his mission) Hello? Hey, Catherine. (the boy dashes to the equipment and starts to play) Whoa, whoa, slow down, Honey. Be careful. Hey, yeah, sorry. Oh, the house? (the boy plays alone, in apparent safety, as mom is distracted with the call) Yeah, we saw it yesterday... (a low growl comes from beneath the crawl way as a rattling tail disappears to the interior)\nBROYLES: I've made a few calls for you, and this is what I was able to get the Army to declassify on Kelvin Genetics. (hands her a dossier file with images of four men and one woman. Brian Lehrman of Naperville, IL is the cover page) Five lab assistants worked there with Doctor Bishop and William Bell. All of them now in the private sector... none working in biogenetics, as far as I can tell.\nOLIVIA: And Robert Swift?\nBROYLES: No connection.\nOLIVIA: I've been through the missing persons records a dozen times. There's nothing from any of the local hospitals either.\nBROYLES: You're still thinking there was a fourth activist.\nOLIVIA: And if they're out there and impregnated, then who knows how many more of these things we're looking at.\nBROYLES: Though presumably we'd have heard something by now. (begins to walk) Any more sightings?\nOLIVIA: Not any within the last ten hours.\nBROYLES: Maybe it's gone. Maybe it went into the river or died from lack of proper food.\nFBI AGENT: (from her desk) Agent Dunham. Peter Bishop's on line six.\nOLIVIA: Oh (picks-up the line) Hey.\nPETER: (from the lab) Bad news. The poison killed the larvae, but it also poisoned Charlie's blood.\nOLIVIA: Have you spoken to Charlie?\nPETER: Yeah, he's putting on a brave face, but he's not doing well. His blood pressure's down. His kidneys are failing.\nOLIVIA: I don't understand.\nPETER: Walter thinks the larvae act like a parasite, they feeding on their host for nutrients. They're killing him so that they can gestate.\nWALTER: (from across the lab) Tell her Peter... about the blood?\nOLIVIA: (overhearing) What blood?\nPETER: Walter has a theory. He thinks he knows a way to trigger the larvae into self-destructing.\nOLIVIA: How do we do that?\nPETER: Well, we'd have to transfuse Charlie with the creature's blood, mix the mother's blood in with his own. That way, maybe the larvae will think he is one of their own and stop feeding and die of starvation. (pauses) Which sounds crazy - I know, but he seem to think that it'll work.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Then that's what we'll do. Bye. (hangs-up)\nBROYLES: (having heard only half the conversation) What?\nOLIVIA: We need to find the creature.\nMOM: (on cell phone to Catherine) It's got three bedrooms, so... if we want to have another baby we'll be fine. Oh, and, uh, the best part about it is it's got this amazing yard. It's even got a tree house for Tuck. (suddenly concerned for her son's safety, she dismisses her caller and approaches the play equipment) Uh, Catherine, let me call you back. Tuck! (as he enters a crawl tube) Tuck, come out of there. (she grabs him and extracts him) Tuck! (as the beast lingers in the back of the dark space)\nOLIVIA: (overlooking a map) Medford, Waltham, Newton, and an unconfirmed report of a giant snake out of Watertown.\nPETER: What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: That it doesn't make sense. I mean, something this big, why aren't there more sightings?\nWALTER: (bedside) This is just a mild sedative. It might make you feel more relaxed.\nCHARLIE: Thanks.\nWALTER: You're welcome. I'm sorry this has happened to you.\nCHARLIE: It's not your fault.\nWALTER: They didn't tell you.\nCHARLIE: Tell me what?\nWALTER: The creature, where it came from.\nOLIVIA: (announcing to the lab) Astrid, I need a schematic of the sewers, Section E-3 and F-5.\nWALTER: You've had a thought?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I think it's traveling underground.\nASTRID: (minutes later) Here you go.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. Look at that. All the sightings are near major storm drains.\nPETER: And each one of them large enough to accommodate the creature.\nWALTER: That make sense. If it's part tiger, then it would prefer dark. And a python would seek out water.\nPETER: So it's probably only surfacing to eat or ...to mate. (studies his silent father) What?\nWALTER: If it's traveling in the sewer, then we have nothing. It could be anywhere.\nOLIVIA: Walter, it's okay. We're making progress.\nWALTER: No, it's not okay. You tell Agent Francis it's okay. (leaves office despondent)\nPETER: I'll go talk to him.\n(suddenly moaning and groaning loudly - Charlie's pain just climbed to a new level)\nPETER: (to Charlie) Hang on, hang on - - - (to Astrid and Olivia) Hold him down, hold him down.\nOLIVIA: Charlie?!\nPETER: Lift his shirt. (she does and the parasitic larvae are visibly active just below his skin) They're getting bigger.\nOLIVIA: (walking around talking into cell phone) When? (listens) Did you get any witness statements? (listens) Okay, well, can you send me them as soon as you get them? (listens) Thank you.\nPETER: Another sighting?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, this time in a public park off Hawthorne, which is nowhere near any of the other places. (looks at map of sewage lines)\nPETER: So there's no predictable pattern.\nOLIVIA: No, this thing could show up anytime, anywhere, and we'll have no idea. (answer ringing cell phone) Hello.\nCARL BUSSLER: Agent Dunham. Hey, this is Carl Bussler from M.I.T. (walks through his residence)\nOLIVIA: What can I do for you, Carl?\nCARL BUSSLER: Uh, you said to call if anything came up, and I think maybe something might have.\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nCARL BUSSLER: Uh, this kid Jonathan hasn't been in class for the last few days. And I don't know if he was friends with Chris or whatever, but he was into all that animal rights stuff too. Anyway, no one's seen him.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'll look into it. What's his last name?\nCARL BUSSLER: Uh, Swift. Jonathan Swift.\nRECEPTION: Miss! (to Olivia as she marches to a back office) You can't go back there!\nROBERT SWIFT: (casually) Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: You lied to me.\nROBERT SWIFT: I did?\nOLIVIA: You obstructed the course of a Federal investigation into the deaths of five people.\nROBERT SWIFT: (to two researchers) Will you excuse us for a minute?\nOLIVIA: Doctor Swift, you failed to tell me that your son Jonathan was at M.I.T.\nROBERT SWIFT: I'm not sure how that's relevant.\nOLIVIA: Three of his classmates were torn limb from limb the other night, and he hasn't been seen since. I would say that that would be very relevant.\nROBERT SWIFT: I don't know how that happened, but my son was not involved.\nOLIVIA: When was the last time you spoke to Jonathan?\nROBERT SWIFT: A few days. He's very busy at school.\nOLIVIA: Yes, I know. Politically active. Animals First. He wasn't too fond of the work you did here, was he?\nROBERT SWIFT: I really can't say. Is this going somewhere, Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Yes, a motive. I believe that he found out about your studies, that your lab was testing on animals, and he and his friends broke in here two nights ago. But what he didn't know was that you do more than just test on animals - you create them, dangerous genetic hybrids.\nROBERT SWIFT: We're done here. (starts to walk off) Any further questions, you're gonna have to go through my attorney.\nOLIVIA: (pursues him) Doctor Swift, this thing has already killed five people and infected one of our agents. As we speak, his offspring is growing inside of him, killing him. Do you really want his death on your conscience. Now your son is out there, maybe injured, maybe infected, and I can help. But you need to help me too.\nROBERT SWIFT: (distraught) It didn't kill five people.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me?\nROBERT SWIFT: It was seven.\n- - - -\nASTRID: (answer lab phone) Hello.\nOLIVIA: Hey, Swift broke. He admitted that the hybrid came from his laboratory. Apparently he was collaborating with a geneticist called Cameron Deglmann.\nASTRID: Oh. Well, where is this guy?\nOLIVIA: Uh, dead. He was at the lab along with Swift's son when the students released the creature.\nASTRID: So what is the link to Kelvin Genetics?\nOLIVIA: Well, that's the interesting part. You got a pen.\nASTRID: Good news. That was Olivia. Swift confessed. Apparently this monster has nothing to do with your work, Walter.\nPETER: What?\nASTRID: Swift was working with a geneticist. For years he was pursuing this work, a Cameron Deglmann.\nWALTER: Deglmann, of course.\nPETER: Whoa, whoa, who's Deglmann?\nWALTER: A pioneer in hybridization. Quite brilliant. In fact it was his work that inspired my research in the first place.\nPETER: And it never even crossed your mind that he might be involved?\nWALTER: He had a very forgettable face.\nASTRID: And in the more good news column, Olivia was able to get the combination of animals that went into the hybrid.\nWALTER: Oh, oh, go on.\nASTRID: Uh, Heloderma Suspectum.\nWALTER: Yes, a venomous lizard native to North America. Also called the Gila Monster.\nASTRID: Megarhyssa Macrurus.\nWALTER: Parasitic Wasp. Interesting.\nASTRID: Desmodus Rotundus and --\nWALTER: Wait, did you say Desmodus Rotundus?\nASTRID: Yeah. Why, what is that?\nPETER: It's a type of bat.\nWALTER: Of course. Why didn't I think of it before?...\nPETER: ...their immune system...\nWALTER: ...makes it a perfect candidate for genetic hybridization.\nASTRID: I'm lost.\nPETER: Bats have an immune system that's unique in the animal kingdom. They can carry on hundreds of different diseases without ever being affected.\nWALTER: That's same system makes it possible for the creature to mature without rejecting its various parts. The bat was the missing ingredient that allowed the creature to survive.\nASTRID: So now that you know what it is, can you help Charlie?\nWALTER: No. We'll still need a specimen of the creature's blood.\nASTRID: Okay. Okay, well, we know what it's made of. We know that it moves through the sewer. So can't we, I don't know, Like, bait it or something?\nPETER: Just so I'm clear, are you actually suggesting that we go down into the sewers and wait for this thing to eat us?\nASTRID: Oh, no.\nWALTER: Yes! Yes.\nPETER: Oh, no. No?\nWALTER: It's not interested in food.\nASTRID: No.\nWALTER: But we do have something that it is interested in.\n- - - -\nWALTER: (briefs the science team) Bats are a highly maternal species. They are quite protective of their young.\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you saying that we can lure this thing by dangling those larvae in front of it?\nWALTER: Yes. but no.\nPETER: Oh, great, this again.\nWALTER: It won't be necessary to be in front of it. Bats are capable of seeking out their offspring from miles away. We've already determined that it's traveling through the sewer systems - so we just need to lure it from a central location.\nPETER: Wonderful, so we're gonna antagonize this thing into chasing us and then what, Walter?\nWALTER: Well, now that I have a better idea of its biological makeup, I think I can kill it, Assuming that you can provide us with 50-caliber incendiary rounds, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's not exactly F.B.I. standard-issue, Walter. Are you sure about this?\nWALTER: If my theory is correct and the bat traits are dominant in the creature, then yes, I believe we can successfully lure it. Whether we can survive the encounter is the more intriguing question.\n- - - -\nPETER: (looks over weapons) Okay, we missing anything?\nWALTER: Could you carry these, son? (hands him a tray of wiggling larvae)\nPETER: Sure thing.\nWALTER: Be careful. You must be very gentle with them.\nPETER: Right,'cause we wouldn't want to hurt the monster babies. (slams tray down)\nOLIVIA: (checks in with Charlie before leaving) You need anything?\nCHARLIE: (tucked under a blanket, ailing) A shot of J.D. and a chaser of beer would be nice. (thinks) You know, hunting this thing in the sewers... It's not a good idea, Liv.\nOLIVIA: You got a better idea?\nCHARLIE: Yeah. Don't get hurt for me.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's not really very fair considering you would do the same thing for me. I'll be back soon... promise. (walks over to Astrid) You will call me if his condition changes.\nASTRID: I will.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) We ready?\nPETER: Ready as I'll ever be. Walter, let's go.\nWALTER: Be right there, son. (secretly pockets a bottle of poison)\nWALTER: (approaching a manhole cover on a busy sidewalk) Based on the schematics, this will make a fine infiltration point.\nPETER: (to a curious pedestrian) Nothing to see here, ma'am. (pulls lid off manhole) Just routine maintenance. - - - - PETER: (as Olivia finishes climbing down the ladder) Smells great down here. So what's next, Walter?\nWALTER: There's an intersection a hundred feet down here that will conduct the sound most effectively. (the trio walk on, searching with flashlights) - - - - WALTER: Nearly there. (enters a larger chamber with several smaller corridors that fan out) The larvae are creating a vibration, frequencies of sound detectable by bats and hopefully our guest of honor. (uncovers the tray of larvae)\nPETER: Well, now I know what it feels like to be live bait.\nOLIVIA: Hey, come on, let's get into position.\nSONIA FRANCIS: (answers ringing phone after walking in with groceries) Hello.\nCHARLIE: You just get in?\nSONIA FRANCIS: Hi. I thought it might be you. I just got in from the market. I ran into Jody. (laughs)\nCHARLIE: What is it?\nSONIA FRANCIS: Oh, uh, she just told me a really funny joke.\nCHARLIE: Tell me.\nSONIA FRANCIS: ...so the patient goes to his doctor and he says, \u2018Doctor, if I give up wine, women, and song, will I live longer?\u2019 and the doctor says, \u2018Well, no. But it'll feel longer.\u2019\nCHARLIE: (laughs, wheezes in discomfort)\nSONIA FRANCIS: You don't think that's funny.\nCHARLIE: I do.\nSONIA FRANCIS: No, you don't. Are you gonna be home for dinner?\nCHARLIE: I don't know.\nSONIA FRANCIS: Okay, alright. Well, I will see you when you get home. And I love you, babe, even more for laughing at that joke.\nCHARLIE: And I love you too.\nSONIA FRANCIS: Bye-bye.\nWALTER: Frightening situation like this, two things occur to me. The first is a song. I used to sing to Rufus.\nPETER: (explains) Our dog.\nWALTER: When he was young, he used to have night terrors. (starts reciting an old song) Van Amburgh is the man, who goes to all the show, he steps into the lion's cage, and tells them he knows. He puts his head in the lion's mouth...\nPETER: (interrupts) ... hey Walter, think we can wait down here to be mauled in silence, please?\nWALTER: Of course.\nOLIVIA: (chimes in) So what was the second thing?\nWALTER: Hmm?\nOLIVIA: You said two things occur to you.\nWALTER: Oh, the second thing. I need to tinkle. Could either of you direct me to the facilities?\nPETER: The facilities? You're in the sewer, Walter. You're knee-deep in the facilities.\nWALTER: Quite right. Excuse me. (wanders away)\nPETER: (to Olivia) Don't say that I never take you anywhere. (Walter closes a metal screen door behind him and secures it) Hey, open this up right now.\nWALTER: I'm afraid I can't do that, Peter. No one else is going to get hurt. This thing is a mistake, and I'm going to correct it, alone.\nPETER: Walter! Hey! Walter... you open this gate right now!\nWALTER: You were right, Peter. I live in a society - and I need to clean up after myself.\nPETER: Walter, it's not your fault. You did not do this.\nWALTER: No, but I could have. I pursued the same science...\nOLIVIA: Walter, Walter, you're not prepared for this. That thing could tear you apart.\nWALTER: You're right. I had almost forgot. I've already considered that possibility.\nPETER: Walter, is that the Trichlorimide? (Walter swallows the poison) No, no, no! What are you doing? That's gonna kill you. (struggles to break through the gate)\nWALTER: (in distress) Should the creature consume me, it will only be poisoning itself. Afterwards, you remove its blood and save Agent Francis.\nPETER: Walter, listen to me, I don't want you to do this. Okay? Do you hear what I'm saying? I do not want you to do this.\nWALTER: Should I live, there's an antidote in the lab, which I should ingest within the hour. So time is of the essence.\nPETER: Walter. Walter, stop right there. Walter, come back here! (Walter turns and flees) Stop right now! Walter!\n(making his way alone through the wet nastiness, discarded belongings and steaming pipes)\nWALTER: (singing soflty to himself) Van Amburgh is the man, who goes to all the shows, - - - who goes to all of the shows, he steps right into the lion's cage.\nPETER: (prying open the gate that Walter secured minutes before wandering away) Selfish son of a bitch. If he lives through this... I am gonna kill him myself.\nWALTER: (melodically) The hyena in the next cage, most terrible to relate, got awfully hungry the other night... and ate up his female mate. (tentatively) He's a most ferocious beast, don't go near him, little boys, for when he's mad, he swings his tail... and makes an awful noise.\n(the creature, hanging inverted, stares at Walter from just a few feet away, rattles its' tail and appears ready to attack)\nWALTER: Oh, dear god.\nPETER: (racing from around the corner with Olivia) Walter! Walter!\n(the creature snarls, drops to the ground, sweeps Walter to the ground, then turns and dashes toward the approaching duo)\nWALTER: Ohh!\n(shots ring, and the creature falls. Walter sighs... holding a smoking pistol)\nPETER: Are you okay?\nWALTER: Yes. Although when I mentioned that the poison would kill me within the hour, did either of you happen to notice the time?\n(the team works to prepare a remedy. Walter takes the antidote to the poison he ingested. Charlie receives an intravenous drip)\nCHARLIE: That's it then?\nWALTER: Now we wait. (to Astrid) Prepare Agent Francis for the ultrasound.\nOLIVIA: (studying Charlie as he reflects on the situation) What?\nCHARLIE: Sonia and I, we've been talking a lot lately about having a baby.\nASTRID: (intercedes) Sorry, I gotta gel you up.\nWALTER: (to Peter) You were right. What you said before about the consequences, I don't think of them, never have. Don't know if I can. That's not who I am.\nPETER: I know. But you were brave today.\nWALTER: Yeah. Check in on Agent Francis. Let's look in on our little friends. (studying the ultrasound monitor)\nASTRID: It didn't work.\nWALTER: Ever the pessimist. Look.\nOLIVIA: (as the activity on the monitor ceases) They're dying.\nCHARLIE: What happens now?\nWALTER: Now you crap 'em out.\nSONIA FRANCIS: (half asleep in bed) Hey, you're home.\nCHARLIE: (sits on edge of bed) I didn't mean to wake you.\nSONIA FRANCIS: (after a kiss and a snuggle) You feel good.\nCHARLIE: So do you. (nodding-off)\nSONIA FRANCIS: um-huh\n(Olivia opens the door to find Rachel and Ella curled-up together, sleeping. in her room she tucks in for the night and turns off her light. with the wind howling and the days events behind her... she decides to sleep with the light on)"

Three floating circus balloons -- red, yellow and blue -- are attached to the stroller. She is approached by an ill-kempt man.)\nMAN: Evening, little lady.\n(Risa ignores the man and continues to the platform.)\nRISA: Baby, we're gonna run.\n(she just misses train number seven.)\nRISA: Damn it! Mommy didn't say that.\n(sooner than expected, another train approaches as Lucy plays with the attached balloons.)\nRISA: It's our lucky day, Baby. Here it comes.\n(Lucy unties the red balloon and it floats upward. Risa reaches for the balloon, and as she does so, the front of the train pulls even with her. Immediately, someone with long blond hair and a dark coat rushes from behind her and pushes her in front of the train.)\nRISA (gasps): Oh \u2014\n(from another viewpoint, the murderer is Olivia Dunham.)\n(at that moment, Olivia jolts awake in her bed from the nightmare vision she had. Disturbed, she gets up. Several hours later, she is sitting in the kitchen working a crossword puzzle with the television news on in the background.)\nWEATHER REPORTER: We have a low-pressure center here, backed up with a cold front coming across the east. And then, here in the west, we've got a high-pressure ridge coming in with a warm front that's descending across the western part of the country...\n(Rachel enters the kitchen.)\nRACHEL: I always hated you could do that.\nOLIVIA: I always hated that you could date two guys at the same time.\nRACHEL: (looking at nearly empty coffee pot): Really, Liv? What time did you wake up? Are you okay?\n(Ella arrives unnoticed.)\nELLA: Aunt Liv, I'm getting vascinations.\nRACHEL: Vaccinations! Come on, baby, go get dressed.\nELLA: They put something dead inside you. Dead! Into your blood. Gruesome.\nRACHEL: Ella Jae, please go get dressed.\nELLA: Yes. (leaves room.)\nOLIVIA: Gruesome.\nRACHEL: Gruesome? That's a good word.\nOLIVIA: (reading a crossword clue): \"Ten Across. A Jabberwock's...\"\nTELEVISION REPORTER: ...and in other news, a suicide on the new york subway system last night got rush hour off to a slow start this morning. Risa Pears, a New York City school teacher and mother of an 18-month-old daughter flung herself in front of an oncoming train last night while returning home from the circus. Subway service between...\n(Olivia stares at screen and recognizes the face of the woman she dreamed of murdering last night.)\nOLIVIA: I want permission to go into New York to investigate a case.\nBROYLES: What is it?\nOLIVIA: A suicide on the subway.\nBROYLES: I read about it in the paper this morning. How exactly is this a case?\nOLIVIA: I believe that the woman may have been murdered. There may have been extraordinary circumstances.\nBROYLES: What kind of extraordinary circumstances? (waits) I'm listening.\nOLIVIA: Uh... that's all I'm comfortable saying at the moment, sir.\nBROYLES: Dunham, are you alright? For the last few weeks you've seemed...distracted. On edge.\nOLIVIA: I haven't been sleeping very well. I wouldn't be asking if this wasn't important.\nBROYLES: Dunham, you're a crucial part of this operation. You're very valuable to me. Twenty-four hours. Then I want you back on the job, head clear.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: Olivia, it was a nightmare.\nOLIVIA: It felt like I was really there.\nPETER: No, you were asleep in your bed.\nWALTER: Just a minute. Have you experienced any nausea, Agent Dunham? Rashes, hair loss -- even a strand or two on the pillow?\nOLIVIA: No.\nWALTER: Any pain urinating, or blood?\nPETER: I don't think you're helping.\nOLIVIA: Is that a --\nPETER: Yeah, a Geiger counter.\nWALTER: Not a rad. I thought you might have teleported to New York in your sleep and killed her. Wouldn't that have been wondrous? But even the most controlled matter to energy transmutation leaves behind some background radiation. So... ergo, you were not actually there.\nPETER: Great. Well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.\nWALTER: Astral...\nASTRID: Astrid!\nWALTER: ...projection. A spirit walk, as it were. No, no, no, you wouldn't have had sufficient corporeal form to interact with the young woman.\nPETER: Here we go. It's like listening to a broken record, but the lyrics keep on changing. She had a bad dream.\nOLIVIA: No, I could smell the platform. I saw her baby staring at me. I saw her face before I saw the news. How is that possible?\nWALTER: Opium?\nOLIVIA: It wasn't just a dream - was it?\nPETER: New York it is.\nWALTER: Yeah. I love New York. Oh, we could catch a show! Pippin! Uh...no. \u266a cats fit on the windowsill... children fit in the snow\nPETER: Walter, you're staying here. (to Astrid) I'll make it up to you.\nWALTER: \u266a Why do I feel like... I don't fit in anywhere I go? \u266a\nASTRID: That is the Jackson Five, right?\nWALTER: hmm? Absolutely.\nOLIVIA: She said to meet her at the clock.\nPETER: There she is.\nPOLICE OFFICER: You the two?\nOLIVIA: Uh, Dunham, Bishop. FBI.\nPOLICE OFFICER: You know, you shouldn't eat those. (big salty pretzel)\nPETER: About thirty years too late on that.\nOLIVIA: Can you show us where this actually happened?\nPOLICE OFFICER: Yep. Let's go. (walking to the tunnels) Are we safe?\nPETER: Sorry?\nPOLICE OFFICER: FBI comes into my house, first thing I need to ask is, 'Are we safe?'\nOLIVIA: I'm not sure we're ever really safe.\nPETER: We're as safe as houses. What can you tell us about this suicide?\nPOLICE OFFICER: Just like it said in the papers, Risa Pears, 28, decided to take a header in front of the 'Seven Train'.\nOLIVIA: So what makes you think that it was a suicide?\nPOLICE OFFICER: Security cameras got it all.\nOLIVIA: I'd like to take a look at that tape myself.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Alright, we'll set you up, Agent. What, exactly, are we looking for here?\nOLIVIA: Humor me. (privately to Peter) There's gonna be a balloon floating on the ceiling. A red one.\nPETER: (trackside) The husband was away on business in Seattle. He just flew back in. He's giving a statement down at the station.\nOLIVIA: Come on, this doesn't fit the profile. Married, a baby. You don't take your kid to the circus and then giv'em a front-row seat to watch you kill yourself.\nPETER: (pointing at red balloon) And then there's that.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nTODD PEARS: This doesn't make any sense. She'd been waiting to go to the circus. And she's from here. We met in Chicago. She kept saying that she wanted to take Lucy to the circus. Okay? She used to sing you this song about elephants. We were happy. She wouldn't kill herself. You've gotta believe me. She would never kill herself.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Agent, the surveillance you wanted is ready.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nTODD PEARS: Sh-she wouldn't do it. She just wouldn't.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(Olivia walks into room with video playing)\nPOLICE OFFICER: Mm-hmm. This is the digital backup. The primary drive is in evidence.\nOLIVIA: (looking at the monitor) Can you slow this down? Can I get a copy of this?\n(Olivia, Walter, Peter and Astrid watch the security recording)\nOLIVIA: See, it doesn't make any sense. I remember things from the crime scene. I remember pushing her.\nWALTER: You know dreams aren't always literal. Perhaps you killed this young woman in some less direct way.\nOLIVIA: No, no, no, no, no, no. We just watched her kill herself.\nWALTER: Perhaps you compelled her to jump using your mind. Do you have any reason to want her dead? Romantic rival, perhaps?\nPETER: What?!\nOLIVIA: I didn't even know her.\nWALTER: Then why did you kill her?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nPETER: Stop, both of you. Stop. Nobody killed anybody.\nWALTER: I'm surprised at you, Peter. Agent Dunham is your friend. You trust her. she says she killed that girl. Are you presumptuous to believe her only when she says what you want to hear? Your mother was a bit like that. Consider this question - What is mankind's oldest dream?\nASTRID: World peace?\nWALTER: Oh, hardly. It's a social construct imposed by an awareness of our own mortality.\nASTRID: Should have gone with 'great taste - less filling'.\nWALTER: What is the greatest desire of the weak and the subjugated? Of the man whose fire is stolen by an opponent whose only advantage is the luck of superior size.\nASTRID: We're stealing fire?\nPETER: I think we're cavemen in this story.\nWALTER: Whose woman is wrenched away by brutality and force.\nPETER: Sexist cavemen at that.\nWALTER: Simple. to kill with thought. To wish someone dead. To murder with the mind.\nPETER: Come on, that's ridiculous.\nWALTER: You're right, I'm sure. Unless, of course, it happens again.\n(mostly couples speak in hushed voices. Olivia is sitting alone at a table when she notices one couple in particular. the man flirts casually with the hostess)\nMOUSE WILLIS: Why would you do that?\nBILLY WILLIS: What? Come on.\nMOUSE WILLIS: Do you think it's okay to just flirt with her like that?\nBILLY WILLIS: Honey, honey, please.\nMOUSE WILLIS: What is it -- I'm not young enough? (stands-up, enraged)\nBILLY WILLIS: Is there something wrong?\nMOUSE WILLIS: I'm not sexy enough anymore? Why are you doing this too me?\nBILLY WILLIS: What is the matter?\nMOUSE WILLIS: You bastard!\nBILLY WILLIS: Just calm down.\nMOUSE WILLIS: You bastard! You cheating bastard!\nBILLY WILLIS: There's nothing wrong here.\nMOUSE WILLIS: You cheating bastard!\nBILLY WILLIS: (Olivia visualizes standing with the crazed woman as they stab the man, together, with a knife from the cheese plate) Uhh! Uhh!\n(Olivia jolts awake from a nap, gasps and breathes erratically... then dials Charlie on her cell phone)\nOLIVIA: Charlie. Charlie, it's me. Uh, there's been a murder.\nOLIVIA: I tried to kill him.\nPETER: A half-dozen witnesses' statements say she stabbed her husband.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I was there.\nPETER: No\u2026 you were three hundred miles away.\nOLIVIA: And somehow, I'm killing these people in my dreams.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nOLIVIA: Agent Olivia Dunham. This is Peter Bishop.\nPETER: Hi.\nOLIVIA: So what can you tell us, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The damage was quite severe. Upper and lower intestines both shredded. She essentially gutted him. He's gonna die, that's why they gave her permission to be here.\nOLIVIA: So your name is Mouse?\nMOUSE WILLIS: Nickname from college. I'm quiet... I guess.\nOLIVIA: Maybe just... tell us what you remember.\nMOUSE WILLIS: We were at dinner. Tuesdays we go out. We decided Italian. I don't know what happened. I just... it doesn't make any sense. Billy's devoted to me. Then suddenly, I knew he was gonna leave me. I was convinced of it, and I got so... scared. I got so angry. How could I do this?\nOLIVIA: Maybe you didn't mean to hurt him. I mean, maybe somebody made you do it. Like, compelled you.\nPETER: Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: I mean, did it feel like there was someone else in your head making you stab him?\nMOUSE WILLIS: I tried to kill my husband, right? How is this happening to me?\nPETER: Agent Dunham.\nMOUSE WILLIS: oh, god.\nOLIVIA: okay...\nPETER: Agent Dunham, I need to talk to you right now.\nOLIVIA: It wasn't you.\nPETER: Olivia, what, exactly, do you think you're doing?\nOLIVIA: I made her do it, Peter.\nPETER: You're running on no sleep. And if I'm right, caffeine pills. I faked my way through grad school, remember? You need to calm down. You're not thinking straight, and you're not making any sense.\nOLIVIA: Peter... what is happening to me?\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: Hey... whoa, we're closed.\nPETER: FBI.\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: Great. Fun times.\nPETER: So what can you tell me about what happened here last night?\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: I got nothing new for you, FBI.\nPETER: Humor me.\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: Sure. Middle of dinner, bitch gets up and stabs her husband.\nPETER: Bitch? Really? We got a problem here?\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: Problem? yeah, We got a problem. People rush out last night in the middle of dinner. No one pays. Today I'm out all of lunch hour. Oh yeah. Also, I'm on the cover of 'The Post'.\nOLIVIA: Who was sitting here?\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: Lady, this isn't 'The Palm'. We don't keep a seating chart.\nOLIVIA (Lunging at manager and pushing him back against table): Who was it?!\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: Whoa! Whoa!\nOLIVIA: Was I there? Was it me?\nPETER: Agent Dunham.\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: ...just some guy. He comes in every now and then. Blond hair. He's got a scar on his face.\nOLIVIA: I know who that is.\nRESTAURANT MANAGER: What the hell is wrong with you? You think you can do whatever you want? What are you, crazy? I'll sue you guys.\nPETER: Olivia, stop. What is wrong with you?\nOLIVIA: That man that he described, I've seen him before.\nPETER: What? Where?\nWALTER: That's a curious word. So it's got nothing to do with going underwater?\nASTRID: No. 'UnSub' stands for unidentified subject.\nWALTER: Actually, it should more logically mean going above water.\nPETER: And still no.\nWALTER: I certainly hope we find him. Who we looking for?\nOLIVIA: I think it's after this.\nWALTER: Remarkable. This is entirely new.\nASTRID: What?\nPETER: You're talking about the coffee?\nWALTER: Mmm, Yes. What is it?\nPETER: Cinnamon?\nASTRID: Yes.\nWALTER: It's quite good. delightful, really.\nOLIVIA: There.\nASTRID: Blond hair, a scar.\nPETER: And he was at both crime scenes.\nOLIVIA: So he's our link.\nWALTER: Interesting. No, not the coffee. Although I was wondering if we can --\nOLIVIA: Walter? Please.\nWALTER: Well, you say he was at the table where you dreamt you were sitting?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: And he was on the platform where you dreamt you were standing?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: And in your dreams you got many of the actual details correct. Is that right?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: But you did not see him in your dreams.\nOLIVIA: No, I didn't.\nWALTER: Well, perhaps that's because you were him. As I said, dreams are not always literal. What if you weren't dreaming about yourself, you were dreaming about him... Mister Unsub?\nOLIVIA: So he's the one that's been doing these things to these people, not me?\nWALTER: That's a possible explanation.\nOLIVIA: But why would I be dreaming of him? I mean, who is he?\nTECH ONE: Government Armed Forces Database is online.\nTECH TWO: Interpol and Public Health Systems online.\nTECH ONE: We can match a partial from the restaurant...\nTECH TWO: ...to one off the guard rail at the subway station. Running facial recognition software.\nBROYLES: Agents. What precisely, is going on here?\nOLIVIA: Sir--\nWALTER: An unsub that may be killing people with his thoughts while Olivia is watching in her dream. (Looking up from playing with a coffee maker.) Uh, by the way, I don't think this machine works.\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham--\nTECH ONE: We\u2019ve got a hit.\nCHARLIE: Suspect\u2019s name is Nick Lane. Uh, former address is St. Jude\u2019s Mental Hospital.\nWALTER: Well I\u2019m not going there.\nBROYLES: I have a lawsuit from a restaurant manager in New York. I have unauthorized allocation of Agency time and resources. I have access of government databases for personal use. What\u2019s going on?\nOLIVIA: Someone\u2019s been coming into my dreams. and he's either been making me kill people, or he's been killing people and making me watch.\nBROYLES: You know how this sounds?\nOLIVIA: These things -- these things that we see every day, these things that we investigate -- they're happening to me.\nBROYLES: Dunham, you understand what kind of scrutiny we're under? You're under? If Sanford Harris weren't in Washington...\nOLIVIA: I know.\nBROYLES: You can't unofficially investigate a case where you're the subject.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m sorry.\nBROYLES: Dunham, why didn't you come to me?\nOLIVIA: I should have... but I didn't want to sound crazy. So maybe -- maybe it's better if I just take some time off -- just a few days -- to work this out. Maybe just take a short leave. I need to do this.\nBROYLES: (on phone) Agent Francis, we have a status change. I\u2019m opening a new case. Subject\u2019s name is Nick Lane. Agent Dunham is on point. Please give her whatever assistance she needs.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nBROYLES: Dunham. (as she leaves) Take care of yourself.\nOLIVIA: I will.\nPETER: You know, until this year, I\u2019d never actually been to a mental hospital\nOLIVIA: learn to like new things.\nPETER: Maybe I never gave it enough thought-- what Walter went through. I only every saw it from my own perspective. His being crazy was something he did to us. To my mother and me. It wasn't something that happened to him.\nOLIVIA: Well, you were young.\nPETER: Well, I\u2019m not young anymore. Must be a terrible thing to not be able to trust your own mind.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Hey...\nDOCTOR MILLER: (enters the waiting area) Are you two the Federal Agents?\nOLIVIA: Uh, yes. Agent Olivia Dunham. This is Peter Bishop.\nDOCTOR MILLER: Doctor Miller. Come with me.\n(the trio walk the hallways)\nDOCTOR MILLER: I remember Nick very well. He was already a residential patient when I arrived here, which is about five years ago now. He had a very comprehensive insurance policy. Quite old. I\u2019d never seen one like it.\nPETER: What kind?\nDOCTOR MILLER: Military. About four months ago a attorney arrived here with a paper saying that Nick had inherited a large sum of money. They met twice more, and after that, Nick checked himself out. He was here voluntarily, after all. Nick was an interesting person. He had a kind of brightness to him.\nOLIVIA: Intelligent.\nDOCTOR MILLER: Yes, quite, but not what I mean. He had an emotional brightness. If he was happy, he would light up a room. Sad, he was like a black hole that would suck you right down with him. Hyper-emotive is the clinical term. Put simply, his affect was highly infectious.\nOLIVIA: Was he dangerous?\nDOCTOR MILLER: No. no, if anything, his ideation tended toward self-contempt. toward the suicidal. Although he did suffer from some psychosis when his delusions were florid.\nPETER: What sort of delusions?\nDOCTOR MILLER: Typical paranoid fare. Nick was convinced he'd been recruited as a child for a series of top-secret experiments. That he was being prepared to serve as a soldier in the coming war against denizens of a parallel universe.\nASTRID: (on her cell phone in the lab reading the ZFT Manifesto) \"There is a war coming. Not a war of hatred and anger - a battle for survival. Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation are among us now. But before they can be considered soldiers, they must be regarded as recruits.\"\nPETER: (on speaker phone, riding with Olivia) It\u2019s alright here. He might as well have the ZFT memorized.\nASTRID: But this is a Manifesto from a terrorist cell in Germany.\nPETER: yeah, ZFT -- it translates as 'Destruction by the Advancement of Technology'. It\u2019s their mission statement.\nASTRID: Yeah, that's my point. You said Nick Lane's been in a nut farm for years, right?\nPETER: The records go back to the mid'90s. So he's quoting the ZFT for at least that long.\nASTRID: So when did they recruit him?\nOLIVIA: How old is he?\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: Nick Lane. What year was he born?\nPETER: uh, 1979.\nOLIVIA: Where?\nPETER: Jacksonville, Florida. Aren\u2019t you from Jacksonville?\nOLIVIA: We need to talk to your father.\nPETER: Why, what do you think you know?\nOLIVIA: We need to talk to him now.\nWALTER: Where\u2019s the fire? I always loved that expression, which is curious, since my lab assistant was killed in a fire.\nOLIVIA: What can you tell me about Cortexiphan?\nWALTER: Oh, that takes me back. I remember 'Belly' whipping up a peyote mash--\nOLIVIA: Walter!\nWALTER: Cortexiphan was a highly experimental drug. William theorized that it might enhance certain abilities in predisposed children.\nPETER: Let me guess-- you experimented on people.\nWALTER: Oh, no, no. not me. William. We had quite a disagreement about it.\nOLIVIA: What abilities?\nWALTER: It worked on perception. Carlos Castaneda, Aldus Huxley, Werner Heisenberg, all focused on one single elementary truth. Perception is the key to transformation.\nPETER: Reality is both subjective and malleable. If you can dream a better world, you can make a better world.\nWALTER: Or perhaps travel between them.\nPETER: What did you just say?\nOLIVIA: So if Nick Lane was treated with Cortexiphan, he could change reality with his thoughts. He could make somebody do something just by thinking it.\nWALTER: Not his thoughts. It\u2019s how you feel that determines your view of the world.\nOLIVIA: You\u2019re saying that Cortexiphan worked on feelings.\nWALTER: That\u2019s reductive, but essentially, yes.\nOLIVIA: What if Nick Lane... wasn't affecting people with his thoughts? What if he was affecting them with his emotions? The psychiatrist said that he was suicidal, right? They said that his moods were contagious. What if he was on the platform because he was considering killing himself?\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nOLIVIA: Look, at the restaurant, all happy couples. it triggers his own fear of abandonment. And that woman caught his mood.\nPETER: For the sake of argument, let's say that Nick\u2019s emotions are contagious, like a virus. Maybe he's even doing this unwittingly, but it still doesn't explain how you're seeing him in your dreams.\nWALTER: If William had followed the usual procedures... you see, often when we experimented on children--\nPETER: Okay, can we just stop right there and analyze that sentence for a second?\nWALTER: ...we would put them in pairs. Like the buddy system in summer camp.\nPETER: Listen to him! He\u2019s comparing human experimentation to summer camp!\nWALTER: This pairing kept them from becoming frightened or feeling isolated. Sometimes an intense bond could form... a bond... which could be greatly amplified by a drug like Cortexiphan.\nPETER: Stop it, both of you. You\u2019re creeping me out. Olivia was never treated with Cortexiphan.\nWALTER: Is that true, Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: I might have been.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: Well, that's good news.\nOLIVIA: How is that good news, Walter?\nWALTER: This Nick Lane of yours -- it means I may know how to find him.\n(\u266a a scantilly clad lady dances and entices Nick Lane - through Olivia's visions \u266a - Olivia lies in the lab, under hypnosis)\nOLIVIA: (mumbles to those around her) He\u2019s sexually excited. His excitement has infected the dancer. She\u2019s excited too. They\u2019re leaving the club together.\nBOUNCER: (to the dancer as she departs with Lane) What, are you nuts, Ginger?! You\u2019re in the middle of your shift!\nASTRID: (just arriving) What\u2019s going on?\nWALTER: I\u2019m hypnotically stimulating R.E.M. state to enhance her psychic connection to Nick Lane. We\u2019re tuning her antenna, as it were.\nPETER: Olivia can feel what Nick Lane is feeling. She can see what he's seeing.\nOLIVIA: oh--\nASTRID: What\u2019s happening? Is he hurting her?\nOLIVIA: oh...\nASTRID: Oh.\nWALTER: What?\nOLIVIA: oh...\nPETER: Oh.\nWALTER: What?\nOLIVIA: ohhh.. ohhh.. (moaning in pleasure)\nWALTER: Oh, I see.\nOLIVIA: (visualizing herself as Lane in the dancer's apartment) He\u2019s feeling guilt. Shame. He feels dirty. He hates himself. He wishes he was dead. The dancer... He\u2019s infecting her. She\u2019s catching it. His emotions are jumping to her. How much he hates himself. The girl... he's infecting her.\n(Ginger takes breaks a glass in the bathroom, shatters it and cuts her own throat with Olivia's help)\nOLIVIA: She\u2019s dead. I killed her.\nWALTER: No, no, you didn't. You must stay under. Agent Dunham, you must try to stay under. She must try to stay under.\nASTRID: What is going on? Did he just kill someone? Did he kill that dancer?\nWALTER: These are dreams. This boy is essentially a reverse empath. His feelings are killing people. Put simply, Agent Dunham\u2019s mind is recognizing the effects of his emotions on his victims, and translating them into images that her dreaming mind can recognize.\nPETER: Put simply.\nWALTER: Peter... help her. Help her calm down. Go ahead, son. (Peter takes her hand) Agent Dunham... Where are you? Where are you? What can you see? What can you see?\n(she visualizes herself entering Lane's apartment building)\nWALTER: Agent Dunham... Where are you?\nOLIVIA (awaking): I know where he lives.\n[alarm clock buzzing]\nCHARLIE: It\u2019s clear!\nOLIVIA: Clear.\nCHARLIE: Come over here. I think you should take a look at this.\nWALTER: The 'Torre Attack'. Someone\u2019s been a busy bee.\nPETER: Look at the dates on these papers. This guy's been collecting this stuff for years.\nWALTER: I\u2019ve always wanted a two-headed goat. What newspaper is this? Can I get a subscription?\nPETER: Walter!\nOLIVIA: Why now? He was given Cortexiphan over twenty years ago, right? Why is this just happening now?\nPETER: That lawyer shows up at the mental hospital with a magical inheritance, and all of a sudden Nick Lane becomes an emotional atom bomb? Seems a little too coincidental to be coincidence in my book.\nOLIVIA: So what are you saying? You think he was activated?\nWALTER: \"What was written will come to pass.\"\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: It\u2019s written on the wall over here.\nCHARLIE: Got a call from a security guard downtown. We\u2019ve got a positive I.D. of Nick Lane entering a building. He's not alone.\nWALTER: Nick Lane may be turning into a walking epidemic. As his emotions become more intense, they become more contagious.\nPETER: Great. Why can't \"more angry\" ever translate into \"less dangerous\"? And what are we supposed to do if we find him, anyway? I mean, if we get too close to him, aren\u2019t we gonna be infected with his emotions too?\nWALTER: Yes. But perhaps Agent Dunham would not.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nWALTER: You were also treated with Cortexiphan. It might afford you some degree of immunity from Nick's abilities.\nPETER: Why do I get the feeling? You\u2019re not telling us everything?\nWALTER: Because I don't know everything.\nOLIVIA: Officer, we're with the FBI.\nDETECTIVE: You don't want to go up there. We already sent a guy up, now he's on the ledge too. We don't know what the hell's going on up there.\nOLIVIA: Its okay, officer.\nPETER: Olivia...\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m gonna be okay.\nOLIVIA: Nick? Nick Lane?\nNICK LANE: Olive. You heard me. You heard me - you came. You were always the strong one. Whenever I got scared, you could make me feel better. Do you remember, Olive?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m sorry, no, I don't.\nNICK LANE: That\u2019s okay. I think they meant for us to forget. I just couldn't. I did what they told us. I waited Olive. The soldier to come is both natural and unnatural. I waited to be called up. You stay fit; stay focused, and stay ready. I wore the blacks and grays. I blended in. But the call never came. It never came. Then, that man with the glasses, he showed up at the hospital. He spoke all the old words. He said they're coming. He needed warriors. He said... \"what was written will come to pass.\" He said he knew how to wake me up. I shouldn't have listened to him. Sometimes what we wake up, it can't be put back to sleep.\nOLIVIA: Nick, you don't have to do this.\nNICK LANE: I want to stop hurting people! (Removes automatic pistol from pocket and offers it to Olivia.) Take it. Take it. Shoot me. Please Olive? I can't fight this much longer.\n(Olivia takes Nick's pistol.)\nOLIVIA: Listen to me. Come...\nNICK LANE: AAAGGHH!!\n(Unidentified woman jumps to her death, landing on a car near Walter and Peter.)\nWALTER (on the ground, to Peter): Uh, maybe... I do hope Agent Dunham meant to do that.\nNICK LANE: Shoot me! Or I will jump and they will all jump with me.\nNICK LANE: (earnestly) Shoot me Olive! I have to die or I will keep hurting people. Please. We weren't meant for this -- don't make me take them all with me. Please?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. (shooting him twice in the legs, he falls and those around him fall to the ground, away from the precipice)\nNICK LANE: Olive... you'll wish you had... you'll wish you'd kill me.\n(the trance is broken and the those lured to the roof begin to recover)\nBROYLES: (walking a long white corridor) Nick Lane's parents died several years ago. Car accident. His lawyer's identity appears to have been falsified. We've repeated our request to Massive Dynamic for information regarding the Cortexiphan protocols. But according to Nina Sharp, the names of the particpants were deleted from the records. And you still have no memory of the trials...\nOLIVIA: ...no.\nBROYLES: ... or being treated with the drug?\nOLIVIA: ...no.\nBROYLES: ...but he does?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nBROYLES: Why do think that is?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\n(they stop at Lane's window and study him on a hospital bed)\nBROYLES: You saved his life. He's being kept in a drug-induced coma.\nOLIVIA: For how long?\nBROYLES: Indefinitely.\nOLIVIA: He said sometimes what we wake up can't can't be put back to sleep... I wonder if he was right.\nBROYLES: Are you alright Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\n(Olivia enters to find Ella asleep on the couch and sits by her as she wakes)\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nELLA: Aunt Liv. The stuff that they put in me isn't dead anymore. It came back alive. Can that really happen?\nOLIVIA: It's just bad dreams, baby girl. It's just bad dreams. Come on. (picks up the child) Ooh, you're getting so big. I'm going to put you back to bed.\n- - - -\n(answers a knock on the door and is handed a stack of files by Charlie)\nCHARLIE: I'm breaking about a thousand regulations by doing this. Here's Nick Lane's file.\nOLIVIA: I know. I appreciate it Charlie. Thank you.\nCHARLIE: Okay. (walks off as Olivia close the door. she opens the file to find a handful of newspaper clippings from Lane's apartment)\n(rummaging through a storage box, Walter finds some old cassette tapes and starts watching one. haunted by what he sees and hears - a small blonde child sits huddled on the floor while voices dialogue from off the screen)\nWILLIAM BELL: Is the incident contained?\nFEMALE VOICE: Yes, Doctor Bell.\nWILLIAM BELL: How bad?\nFEMALE VOICE: Bad.\nWILLIAM BELL: Casualties?\nFEMALE VOICE: Not sure yet. We can't locate Brenner.\nWILLIAM BELL: Is SHE okay?\nFEMALE VOICE: SHE is fine.\nWILLIAM BELL: Hell, do we know what triggered it?\nWALTER: Obviously she was upset, William. (to the child) It's okay. It's alright now. Nobody is angry with you. You didn't do anything bad. It's alright Olive... everythings going to be okay.\n(Walter sits silently, alone in the dark lab and stares at the screen)"

We're going to take you live now to Janice Lincoln, on the scene at another Boston nightclub\nJANIS LANGIS: The body was found here by Pier Seven. Police are canvassing the area. No witnesses have come forward at this time. And authorities are baffled by what appears to be one of the most gruesome murders in Boston's history. The media has being blocked from the immediate crime scene and all we have been told is that a body was found mutilated by what might have been a hunting knife. Police are withholding the name of the victim until their family can be contacted.\n(Dunn picks up his pocket items, including a large knife)\nJANIS LANGIS: There were a number of crimes... not the safest neighborhood... but there haven't been violent crimes of this nature, before. Until... comes forward, Police have no clues in this bizarre murder that occurred here tonight.\n(Dunn's cell phone rings.)\nBOB DUNN (To phone): Hello, beautiful.\nDIANE: Finally. Where have you been? Did you get my message?\nBOB DUNN: I did.\nDIANE: But you didn't call me back.\nBOB DUNN: No, I thought I'd call you later. There was a conference.\nDIANE: Where were you last night, Bob?\nBOB DUNN: I was at home. I was catching-up on my sleep.\nDIANE: But I called.\nBOB DUNN: You know I turned off the phone to get some sleep. Hey, come on, now, you're starting to go down that road again. Before you know it, you'll be all upset. I think this has more to do with the miles between us, all that dreary weather you're having in Portland. You'll feel much better when you get back tomorrow. Hey, we'll, uh, we'll do something nice. In fact, we'll stay in. I'll cook for us.\nDIANE: I'd like that, Bob.\nBOB DUNN: Listen, love, I'll call you when I get home tonight. Right now I've gotta go have dinner with these insufferable suits from Hong Kong.\nDIANE: I hope it won't be too awful.\nBOB DUNN: You never can tell.\n(Dunn enters the club, pausing to have his hand stamped. Techno music is playing. Dunn looks at several women before selecting one who is standing alone.)\nBOB DUNN: You know what's funny... before I came in here, I thought I was good-looking.\n(The woman scoffs at his comment. Dunn laughs pleasantly.)\nBOB DUNN: Seriously, though, I can tell you're my type of girl.\nBLONDE WOMAN: How do you know?\nBOB DUNN: I know these things. (her male friend returns with her drink) Cheers Mate.\n(Dunn looks for another woman and makes eye contact with Valerie Boone)\nBOB DUNN: I can tell you're my kind of girl.\n(Dunn and Valerie are making out while standing. Valerie pulls back and pushes Dunn into a chair. She then reaches out and breaks his neck.)\n(The scene switches briefly to Portland, where Diane is in bed, reaches for her cell phone and dials Dunn's number.)\n(Back in Dunn's apartment, his phone vibrates with the call while Valerie, standing in Dunn's bathroom wipes blood off her cheek and looks at her own unnaturally bright blue eyes. A wide shot shows Dunn's body prostrate on his bed with his spine violently exposed.)\n(Ella and Graham play in the kitchen as the adults sit and chat in the living room)\nRACHEL: Oh Olivia, you have to hear how Helen and Neil met. This could be good for my sister.\nNEIL: We're both single. We're in our thirties, hadn't met anyone. We wanted to have a kid. Then I heard about this program called, Two Singles Together. Two Singles Together was the answer for us.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, two--?\nRACHEL: Two Singles Together. It's a matchmaking service.\nNEIL: Not just a matchmaking service, Rachel. A way of life.\nOLIVIA: Two Singles Together?\nHELEN: Uh, I have my own schedule, works for me. I have no interest in controlling Neil's, either.\nNEIL: I like vacations in the sun and...\nHELEN: ...and I like the snow.\nOLIVIA: Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of being in a relationship?\nNEIL: Well, there are things we agree on, of course.\nHELEN: Like, um... where to live. The appropriate kindergarten. Friends we both enjoy. Which, incidentally, I want to make sure Ella can attend Graham's birthday party.\nRACHEL: Oh, I already R.S.V.P.'d on the class sign up.\nHELEN: Uh, that was for Neil's rock climbing party for Graham. My party for Graham is the following Saturday. We are doing Science Center.\nRACHEL: (doorbell sounds) Excuse me for one minute. (accepts a small package) See ya.\nOLIVIA: What?\nRACHEL: Greg's filing for divorce.\nOLIVIA: Oh, Rach.\nRACHEL: Not now. Not in front of them. They'll make me join Two Singles Together. (rejoins the guests) Okay. Where were we?\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) I'm sorry, I've just been called into work.\nNEIL: oh, what kind of work do you do, Olivia?\nCHARLIE: Victim's name was Bob Dunn, he was thirty -three years old. His girlfriend. Got back from a business trip in Portland. Couldn't reach him. She found him here. No forced entry. No witnesses.\nOLIVIA: So this matched the victim that Boston P.D. found two nights ago at the pier? The one that's been all over the news?\nCHARLIE: Yeah, they don't know what to make of it, so now they have another one. Now it's ours to mix up.\nWALTER: You know what this reminds me of, Peter?\nPETER: Nope, but I'm gonna guess it's something unbelievably disgusting.\nWALTER: Shrimp cocktail. You see, the shrimp must be deveined by putting a shallow cut down the back to expose the vein. Which, in fact, is not a vein at all, but the crustaceans intestinal tract.\nPETER: Great, thanks for that. That's another foodstuff I can cross off the menu for life. (privately) Hey, you okay?\nOLIVIA: Why?\nPETER: Well, you were awfully quiet on the car ride over here and you just don't seem your normal, chipper self at a bloody, gruesome crime scene.\nOLIVIA: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, um... It's just home stuff.\nPETER: Well, I know from home stuff. I live with a guy inspecting a severed spine.\nWALTER: This is fascinating. These appear to be bite marks. See how the flesh is ripped and jagged markings. Canine or even ursine, but human.\nPETER: You're suggesting that someone chewed his spine out?\nWALTER: Yes... But with a jaw strength well in excess of that of a normal human being.\nPETER: Great, well, maybe we're looking for Dracula.\nWALTER: (hardy laugh) Finally, son, you're opening your mind to new possibilities. But, no, there are no vampires, sadly. But it'll be something exciting, I'm sure.\nBROYLES: (seated at desk) We have another monster on the loose?\nOLIVIA: Uh, no, sir. Walter says that the teeth marks are definitely human.\nBROYLES: I can just about remember when a suspect being human was a given, not an option.\nOLIVIA: Bob Dunn's girlfriend said that he had a car, an Audi A-4. It wasn't in the garage, and we couldn't find it when we did a two-block sweep.\nBROYLES: Local P.D. Is on it?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, we could get lucky. Maybe the killer took it.\nBROYLES: And Doctor Bishop?\nOLIVIA: He's at the lab with both bodies, doing autopsies.\nBROYLES: Okay, well, let me know if you learn anything. (she hovers at his desk briefly) Is there something else?\nOLIVIA: This may sound impolitic, sir, but I was wondering if you were satisfied with your divorce attorney. I've heard you talking on the phone to your kids, but never to your wife.\nBROYLES: I was satisfied. Except for the bill.\nOLIVIA: I was wondering if I might be able to get the name and number.\nBROYLES: (he forwards the texting) It should be waiting in your in-box. I hope things work out for your sister. I pay attention too, Agent Dunham.\nWALTER: (lyrically) The C-1 cervical vertebra is connected to the C-2 cervical vertebra. C-2 cervical vertebra is connected to the C-3 cervical vertebra...\nPETER: Walter. That's enough.\nASTRID: When you finally meet a nice girl, I would avoid bringing her home for as long as possible. Walter, this is the lab work you requested on the victim.\nWALTER: Excellent. It may help us understand why their spinal columns have been completely drained of spinal fluid.\nASTRID: The killer took the victims' spinal fluid? Why would they do that?\nWALTER: Where would the fun be if we already knew all there is to know? (reads the report from Astrid) This is interesting. Traces of treponema pallidum. That's the syphilis bacteria. On the victim's neck and back. Most likely from the killer's saliva.\nPETER: So the killer has syphilis?\nWALTER: Seems so.\nPETER: Great. I should of worn gloves.\nWALTER: And what's even more fascinating, this particular strain of syphilis is extinct. Has been for decades.\nPETER: Well, how could the killer be exposed to an extinct strain of syphilis?\nWALTER: See, isn't this fun?\nOLIVIA: (walking through the workarea) I appreciate the C.D.C.'s prompt response on this matter.\nCDC AGENT FEIKEN: Of course. I ran an index search. A sample of that particular strain of syphilis was shipped out four weeks ago to a Lubov Pharmaceuticals. They have a local address in Brighton.\nOLIVIA: Well, thank you, but a phone call would have sufficed.\nCDC AGENT FEIKEN: Actually, I'm not sure that it would have. I took the liberty of running the rest of Lubov's research requests over the past few years. This isn't the first contagion they've ordered from us. In fact, there have been quite a few. (hands her a file to review)\nOLIVIA: We need to show this to Broyles.\n- - (in Broyles office) - -\nCDC AGENT FEIKEN: Any reputable scientist with the appropriate credentials can procure samples of bacteria and viruses for their research.\nOLIVIA: In addition to the extinct syphilis bacteria, Lubov Pharmaceuticals also procured a sample of a substance called RUD-390.\nBROYLES: Which is...\nCDC AGENT FEIKEN: A chemical compound used in the construction of bioweapons.\nBROYLES: You're suggesting whoever's behind these killings may also be planning a biological attack?\nOLIVIA: Or has before. RUD-390 was one of the components of the rapid skin growth toxin that killed Agent Kent.\nBROYLES: You're saying this is Z.F.T.?\nCDC AGENT FEIKEN: Z.F.T.? What's that?\nBROYLES: We believe Z.F.T. is a terrorist organization... responsible for a number of bio attacks in the last year.\nCDC AGENT FEIKEN: I see. Why? What is their agenda?\nOLIVIA: That's what we wanna find out.\nBROYLES: Assemble an assault squad. Move on Lubov.\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir.\n(Boone performs a graphic dissection on a small mammal in his lab\/kitchen as the tactical team enters to arrest him)\nOLIVIA: Federal Agents. You're under arrest.\n(in an interview room at the Federal Building)\nOLIVIA: Doctor Nicholas Boone. Advanced degrees in hematology and biochemistry. Founder of Lubov Pharmaceuticals, a multi-national biotech firm whose corporate offices turn out to be in a split-level, in Brighton.\n(Broyles watches from the observation room)\nOLIVIA: Now we know that this strain of syphilis that you ordered was found on his spine (places photo) And you see these. They're human bite marks. What is out there doing this? What happened to these people? (displays more photos)\nCHARLIE: How long have you been a follower of Z.F.T.? That's right, Doctor Boone. We know about Z.F.T.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: What do you know?\nOLIVIA: Enough to know that they're using the world as a testing ground for experiments. We want to know more about David Robert Jones, About who funds Z.F.T. And why. We want to know what we're dealing with.\nCHARLIE: I don't have to spell it out for you, Doctor Boone. You talk to us, give us information. Help us with whatever's out there killing people. It'll go better for you.\nOLIVIA: Why are you doing this? What have you done?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Someone was dosed.\nOLIVIA: With what?\nCHARLIE: Dosed with what?!\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I know a lot about the things you want. And more. And I'll answer your questions. But you have to help me first.\nOLIVIA: Help with what?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: They have my wife. I want you to get her back.\nOLIVIA: Z.F.T. Has your wife?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: What counts with punishment is the ability to know whom to hurt, and when.\nCHARLIE: You're telling me Z.F.T.'s coercing you to conduct these experiments by threatening to harm your wife.\nOLIVIA: Why would they be punishing you?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Because when I realized what my work was being used for, I tried to get out. I'll tell you everything you want to know. But first, you have to get my wife back.\n- - (in the observation room) - -\nBROYLES: Do you believe him?\nCHARLIE: I don't.\nOLIVIA: Boone's wife is a nurse. I checked with her hospital, and she hasn't been to work in three weeks.\nCHARLIE: Proves nothing.\nBROYLES: I'm inclined to agree with Agent Francis.\nCHARLIE: Everything we know about these guys suggests that they're zealots. Why don't we go back in there, ask him why the sudden change of heart?\nOLIVIA: We can't ask him a thing until we get his wife.\nCHARLIE: Could be a trap.\nOLIVIA: Could be the truth. I'm sorry, but since I've been working in Fringe Division, eighty one people have lost their lives. And that's not including the 147 on Flight 627. Now, in my entire career, only nine people have died on cases that I worked. This is the closest that we've ever come to getting traction and stopping these people. Getting a handle on Z.F.T., Jones... Or more. This guy could be our chance.\nBROYLES: (to knock on door) What is it?\nJUNIOR AGENT: The address Boone gave us, where he says they're holding his wife. It's a restaurant... in Chinatown.\nBROYLES: Doesn't exactly scream Z.F.T. Hive of activity.\nJUNIOR AGENT: They've been tagged by... (?)\nOLIVIA: Meaning?\nJUNIOR AGENT: They're burning five times more power a month than they should making Moo Shoo Pork.\nOLIVIA: They could be using the power for something else. Maybe to facilitate a laboratory? This could be our chance to get to Z.F.T.\nBROYLES: Go get 'em.\nOLIVIA: I'll get a team together.\nPETER: (identifying themselves law enforcment) Peter and Walter Bishop. We're here to catalog the chemical evidence.\nWALTER: (greeting everyone individually) Walter Bishop. Nice to meet you. Hello. Oh, no, please sit down. Bishop, Walter Bishop.\nPETER: Walter, you don't have to shake everybody's hand. He gets a little nervous around authority figures. (sees the vivd dissection) Oh, boy. Look at that.\nWALTER: Benzyl alcohol. Colorless liquid used as a bacteriostatic in solutions for injection, topically as a local anesthetic. Personally, I like to use it as a mouthwash.\nPETER: (studies the bloody scene) What did this guy create?\nWALTER: From what I've seen so far, I am forming a hypothesis. Would you care to hear it?\nPETER: Well, I don't know. Would I ever be able to sleep at night again?\nWALTER: Well, that depends.\nPETER: Depends on what?\nWALTER: On whether the light is on or not.\nCHARLIE: (briefing the team) There's four exits. Risk and Walken, you take the rear. Taub and Brown, you take the side. Dunham and I are gonna be in the front with the rest of you.\nOLIVIA: And remember, this is a hostile situation in a contained environment. So retrieving the hostage unharmed is our top priority.\nSWAT MEMBER: Yes, ma'am.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nRACHEL: Greg wants full custody of Ella.\nOLIVIA: What?\nRACHEL: Another process server just came by. Greg is claiming that I am an unfit parent. That the minor's mental and physical well-being would be best served under the sole custody of the petitioner.\nOLIVIA: He can't be serious.\nRACHEL: I won't let that happen, Liv. I will run if I have to. I will take her and I will disappear, I swear to God.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Rachel, Rachel... Just calm down. You're not running anywhere, and you're not gonna lose Ella.\nRACHEL: He's just doing this to hurt me.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Rachel, listen to me. Now, this is just one of those things that you're gonna look back on and you're gonna say, \"I beat that too.\" Do you hear me?\nRACHEL: I hear you.\nOLIVIA: Okay. So, um, look, Let's talk when I get home. I - I've got a... I gotta go to a meeting.\nRACHEL: Okay.\nOLIVIA: Ahem.\nCHARLIE: We got that meeting.\n(the van pulls up quickly and the tactical team empties into the basement of an Asian style restaurant)\nSWAT MEMBER: Freeze. Get your hands in the air.\nOLIVIA: F.B.I.!\nSWAT MEMBER: Get your ass on the floor!\nOLIVIA: (the team fans out looking for an illegal lab) Clear?\nSWAT MEMBER: Clear!\nOLIVIA: (grabs the guard roughly and demands) Valerie Boone. Ta zai nali?\nGUARD #1: Huh?\nOLIVIA: Nicholas Boone de ai ren. Ta zai nali? Valerie Boone.\nGUARD #1: Shei?\n- - (interview room)- -\nBROYLES: (upset) Your wife isn't there.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I know that. I need to talk to Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone in cellar of restaurant) Dunham.\nBROYLES: I'm putting him on.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: What the hell's going on?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: There's a room in the back. Can you see it?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, we checked. She's not there.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I know, but what I need is.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm here.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: In front of you, you should see a row of refrigeration units. Third from the right.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I see it.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Open it.\nOLIVIA: You know, I'm not gonna do a thing until you tell me why we're here.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: We're getting to that.\nOLIVIA: No, you tell me now.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Inside that cooling unit you'll find a contagion, five vials marked XT43. The person who's out there killing has been dosed with this. I need it to make an antidote.\nOLIVIA: You lied to me?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: No. Agent Dunham... They didn't kidnap my wife. The infected her. That was my punishmnent for trying to leave Z.F.T. It's she who's out there killing.\n(Peter finds and activates a video camera with images of the Boone's at a park)\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Valerie Boone. Valerie Boone, you turn March into June.\nVALERIE BOONE: Okay, that's enough. You be on camera. I always do this.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I have no interest in being on camera.\nVALERIE BOONE: Okay, we'll both -- alright. Hi.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Hello.\nVALERIE BOONE: Us in the park!\n(Valerie finds a ride home with a man driving a Mustang. they park short of her destination to talk)\nMUSTANG MAN: You are so beautiful. You are really warm. You're burning up. What - what's wrong?\nVALERIE BOONE: You're my kind of guy. I'm sorry. (as she proceeds to sever his spine)\nBROYLES: (intercepting her as she exits the elevator) Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Charlie is running a background check on the body that he found in the Mustang. Peter said you had something that I should see.\nBROYLES: (hands her a small video camera) ... found this at Boone's house. You\u2019ll wanna pay specific attention to the date.\n(both join Boone in the interview room and Olivia plays a recent tape)\nNICHOLAS BOONE: (voice on camera) ...whoever wore a lab coat and rubber gloves.\nVALERIE BOONE: (image on camera) oh ho, ho.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Valerie Boone. Valerie boone, you turn March into June.\nVALERIE BOONE: Okay, that's enough. You be on camera. I always do this.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I have no interest in being on camera.\nVALERIE BOONE: Okay, we'll both -- alright. Hi.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Hello.\nVALERIE BOONE: Us in the park!\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Where is--okay. Look out. Okay.\nVALERIE BOONE: Okay.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: There, okay, that's it.\nVALERIE BOONE: No, no, no!\nNICHOLAS BOONE: That's not it.\nVALERIE BOONE: There he goes. Oh, my god, you look like you ran in the trash can. (Boone runs across camera, very able-bodied)\nOLIVIA: (turning off the camera) That video was taken three weeks ago, Doctor Boone. Can you explain to me why you are in a wheelchair today?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: She needs to feed. She can't control it. I began to feed her my own spinal fluid. The more I gave, the more she craved, until... I couldn't give anymore. The contagion burns through her spinal fluid faster than her body can replace it. When she kills, it's simply to... refuel. I tried to synthesize the antidote on my own, watching her suffer the effects of being infected. But I couldn't do it. Not without a dose of the bacteria to work from. For the rest of my life, this chair will remind me of what I've done.\nOLIVIA: Why would Z.F.T. want you to create something like this?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: To create a human nightmare. The syphilis was just a platform. A carrier for other attributes. Attributes that changed her.\nOLIVIA: For what purpose.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: For the same reason they asked me to... Create the skin growth toxin... To show off.\nOLIVIA: To who?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Other scientists. You mean nothing to them.\nOLIVIA: So how many vials were created? Just the ones that I took?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I made six, now accounted for, but I can't guarantee they won't pick up where I left off.\nBROYLES: If they did figure out how to make it, could they weaponize this bacteria?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: You really don't know who you're dealing with. The answer for both of us is to let me make a cure. Now that you've recovered the dose samples, I can make it. My offer still stands. I'll tell you everything I know when you find her. If the cure works, we both win. Now I'll need access to a lab with a blood analyzer. I'll also need a spectroscope and a centrifuge. You might want to write this down.\nOLIVIA: That won't be a problem.\nPETER: Do you really think it's a good idea to let him have free reign in Walter's believe-it-or-not emporium?\nWALTER: Oh, and this is something my son Peter is working on. I haven't got the faintest idea what it is.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Your centrifuge is twenty years old.\nWALTER: Oh, twenty-five. It's an oldie, but a goody. I also have a cow.\nPETER: And, just for the record, one mad scientist is my limit.\nOLIVIA: I think that having him help Walter is our best chance at saving lives. (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: It's Charlie. We found Bob Dunn's missing car.\nOLIVIA: Where?\nCHARLIE: Clear across town, in Mission Hill. It's completely stripped. Quarter panels, radio, everything.\nOLIVIA: The G.P.S.?\nCHARLIE: No, it's gone. We've got no way to track where he picked up Boone's wife.\nOLIVIA: Okay, thanks, Charlie.\nWALTER: Uh, good news, Peter. Nicholas and I are in agreement.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Yes, we need to purify the mold, then ferment it...\nWALTER: ...to the highest possible concentration. Uh, Agent Farnsworth. We are going to need a rat.\nASTRID: Can you, uh, call me if something else turns up?\nOLIVIA: Okay, bye.\nPETER: Great news. They made a breakthrough. They're gonna fight the super syphilis with super penicillin. Syphilis was the platform. If they can kill the syphilis, they can stop the contagion.\nWALTER: I did the same thing once against a super pneumonia.\nOLIVIA: Right. Well, Charlie just found Dunn's car, stripped in Mission Hill.\nPETER: Excellent. He check the G.P.S.?\nOLIVIA: Stolen.\nPETER: Well, everything stolen is not necessarily lost.\nOLIVIA: Meaning what?\nPETER: Meaning if there's a car found stripped in The Greater Boston Area, I can guarantee you my man Mako has his big toe in it.\nOLIVIA: Oh, you have a friend who runs a chop shop?\nPETER: Yeah. You make that sound so illegal.\nPETER: She's with me. I'll owe you one. Okay? (calls her over) Dunham.\nMAKO: Let's just say the G.P.S. is here... allegedly. But it's useless because it's been wiped for resale. Hypothetically.\nOLIVIA: We're trying to track a killer, Mister Mako.\nPETER: Nah, it's just Mako. You know, like Cher.\nOLIVIA: Theoretically, if the G.P.S. is wiped, then that would put you in a rough spot, because you'd be hampering a Federal investigation.\nPETER: ...come on.\nMAKO: I'm trying to work with you here.\nOLIVIA: We need the G.P.S. to find out where the victim was the night of his killing. But you stole his car from his home in Brookline.\nMAKO: I didn't steal his car from Brookline.\nOLIVIA: Where'd you steal it from?\nMAKO: If I tell you where we boosted that car, can we just say that this conversation never happened?\nOLIVIA: Hypothetically? Sure.\nMAKO: Route Eighteen, Weymouth. By the water.\nWALTER: Fascinating. 105 degrees.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Then the rat's successfully infected. This strain of syphilis raises the body temperature well above normal. The cure is nearly complete. Once this penicillin concentrates, we can test it on the rat.\nWALTER: Where did you study, Nicholas?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: At the Curie Institute in Paris. Kings College, Aberdeen, Scotland. It's quite a fall.\nWALTER: It's an honor to have your intellect in my lab.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: That's high praise. Because I know very well who you are.\nWALTER: Well... that makes one of us. A little memory loss is often kind to the soul.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: That a figure of speech? Or do you believe there is such a thing? The soul?\nWALTER: There are days when I wish I did. There are days when I wish I didn't.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: I often wake up at night, frightened, with the understanding that there are things Man shouldn't know. That the scientific trespasses I've committed...\nWALTER: ...will one day be judged. Belly and I would often debate this very thing. William Bell. You've heard of him?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Well, of course. Founder of Massive Dynamic, richest man in the world.\nWALTER: We used to share a lab. Quite a fall. hmm. If indeed there is a soul, we must consider then that there is still time for redemption. We're not being hauled off to be judged yet, Nicholas.\nPETER: This must be where Mako boosted the car. All the shattered glass. So we're thinking what? Boone's wife kills this guy, steals his car, and then drives it out here?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. But what was she doing here?\nPETER: And where did she go? You know what I hate worst than the cold?\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: Not much. (searches nearby shrubs) Olivia, I think I know why she came out here. (located another victim)\nWALTER: The camera, Aspirin.\nASTRID: Okay. Ready.\nWALTER: Ahem. We are about to inject the infected rat with an antidote. Should it prove effective, it will no doubt work on humans as well. Nicholas. Now we wait. Ah! Marvelous. You can bring the bodies right this way, gentlemen. We've been expecting you. Right over here is fine. May I offer you a 'Peek Frean'? A delicious vanilla wafer with raspberry center and lemon cream.\nPETER: He doesn't want a cookie, Walter.\nWALTER: Uh... apparently, you're wrong.\nOLIVIA: That's two more bodies. One we found in the forest in Weymouth, the other on the street in Roxbury. Where is she getting her victims? You must have some idea where she'd go.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: The person out there killing people is not thinking like my wife... well, she wouldn't recognize me... let alone find comfort in places she knows.\nASTRID: This one's been drinking. He smells like a brewery. Hey, Peter, will you turn out the lights?\nPETER: Seriously?\nWALTER: Alright, Peter. I ordered it on television.\nASTRID: It's an entry stamp. He's got the same one. It's a place called The Cavern The industrial area is really happening in the underground club scene right now.\nPETER: So she's going to the club to find these victims.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Look, I need more time to make the cure. Please. If you take her alive, I know I can save her.\nOLIVIA: I'll see what I can do.\nOLIVIA: (to security) Dunham, F.B.I. Him too. He's with me.\nCLUB GIRL: (flirtatious) Now you're my kinda guy. What is that?\nPETER: It's a hand-held thermal imaging radiometer. It tells me if you're hot.\nCLUB GIRL: So...\nPETER: So you're definitely hot. I'm looking for someone with syphilis.\nCLUB GIRL: Uh, okay. (leaves disappointed)\n- - (in the lab) - -\nWALTER: I don't understand. Something's wrong. Something's missing. The rat's body has rejected the cure. Perhaps a protein incompatibility.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: No, it's not that. I know what's wrong. The contagion required cerebral spinal fluid as a catalyst. And the cure must require some as well.\nWALTER: Bond the cure to the contagion.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Yes, and the only spinal fluid we know for a fact is compatible... is my own.\nWALTER: Well, no, that's out of the question. It's too dangerous. If you lose more spinal fluid it could cause a brain hemorrhage.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: No, I was very careful to monitor the amount of fluid I removed. Another twenty-five milliliters should be safe.\nASTRID: Walter... we can't.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: We have no other choice!\nASTRID: Walter.\nWALTER: Prep the table, Agent Farnsworth.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Thank you.\n- - (in the club) - -\nOLIVIA: Anything?\nPETER: No, not yet. I got her. She's moving along the back of the bar.\nOLIVIA: Peter. I can't find her.\nPETER: She was right there, but she's gone now.\nOLIVIA: Okay... uh... alright keep looking. I'm going to check-in with Charlie. Hey, Charlie? We had her but we lost her. You got the exit?\nCHARLIE: Nobody is leaving yet. She's still in there with you Liv.\n- - (in the lab) - -\nWALTER: Have you prepared a (mumbles) spinal fluid, Agent Farnsworth? (to Boone) Come on up. Here we go. Gently.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: Yes. Okay, gently, gently.\nWALTER: Alright?\nOLIVIA: Charlie... Charlie, I think she's headed to you.\nCHARLIE: What's she wearing?\nOLIVIA: Black dress and freakishly blue eyes.\nCHARLIE: On it. Valerie Boone! Are you Valerie Boone? It's her. Take her down. Alright, we've got her. Clear the area.\nASTRID: I just got off the phone with Olivia. Good news, Doctor Boone. They have her.\nWALTER: Oh, excellent.\nASTRID: Doctor Boone? Walter... hmm?\nWALTER: Get me a T.P.A. injection. You lied to me. You let me take too much spinal fluid.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: How far would you go for someone you love?\nASTRID: Unh!\n(the two drive quickly through the night - to get Valerie to the lab)\nPETER: How's she doing?\nOLIVIA: She's going to be out for hours.\nPETER: Where's the siren on this thing?\nOLIVIA: There. Is that why you wanted to drive?\nPETER: Everybody should get to do this at least once before they die.\n(a sedated Valerie Boone stirs awake in the back of Olivia's car)\nPETER: That look says more than just, 'I wish I hadn't have let him drive.'\nOLIVIA: I was just thinking about Nicholas Boone and what he did for his wife. What he is doing. Jeez, that kind of love. Greg asked Rachel for a divorce, and now he's fighting her for custody.\nPETER: You know, I never liked that guy.\nOLIVIA: You've never met Greg.\nPETER: Yeah, but I met your sister. So I know she deserves better.\nOLIVIA: And I thought you were a card-carrying cynic.\nPETER: I am, world class. But there's an argument to be made that beneath every cynic, there is a frustrated romantic.\nOLIVIA: (Valerie attacks Olivia from the backseat) agh! uhh! (Peter swerves trying to help) ohh! Peter! Peter - my tranq gun - uhh!\n(Peter fires twice and Valerie is subdued)\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: I think she liked you.\nWALTER: (to Peter as he carries in Valerie) Good. Bring her in, strap her down.\nOLIVIA: (observing Boone's degraded health) Walter, what happened?\nASTRID: He had a stroke.\nWALTER: Pulse is strong.\nPETER: Yeah, so is she.\nWALTER: Agent Farnsworth, thirty c-c's of the antidote, please. (raises Valerie for an injection) Peter.\nNICHOLAS BOONE: (watches his wife receive the injection. quietly to Olivia) Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (softly) You're welcome.\nASTRID: Okay, now what?\nWALTER: Now we wait.\n(Valerie screams wildly and fights her restraints)\nOLIVIA: Walter...\nWALTER: No - no! Let her!\nPETER: Is she?...\nWALTER: Seems to be working. Agent Farnsworth... prepare a solution, thirty parts saline... and some adrenaline and perhaps a cup of coffee.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: hmm? (checks Boone for a pulse) He's gone.\n- - - -\nWALTER: (later, as the med techs roll Valerie Boone from the lab, Walter approaches Olivia with a video cassette) Doctor Boone asked me to give this to you personally, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: What is it, Walter?\nNICHOLAS BOONE: (on video tape) Agent Dunham, If you're watching this, I suspect I didn't make it. But you and I had a bargain, and, uh, you held up your end. Now, I have made many mistakes in my life, but in the end, I should at least be a man of my word. And I promised you answers. With any luck, you will use them to rectify some of my misdeeds. Now, in the time I worked with Z.F.T., I never dealt with anyone of significant rank within the movement. But I was able to gather some names, including some I suspect you've already heard of.\nBROYLES: Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nBROYLES: Are you alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Uh, Nicholas Boone talked. He told us everything he knew about Z.F.T.\nBROYLES: Did he mention David Robert Jones?\nOLIVIA: No, he said he'd never heard of him. But he did mention another name that we've heard before. According to Boone, the man who's funding Z.F.T... is William Bell."

Everything we know thus far can be found in your packets, including a copy of their manifesto, which elucidates their ideology and their methods - 'destruction by the advancement of technology'. Which in short, boils down to the following, attempting to provoke or prepare for a war.\nNID AGENT: War? With whom?\nBROYLES: That's the question, isn't it? What we do know is that these bizarre acts seem to be increasing in frequency and that their targets are unpredictable, and therefore unprotectable. (as he continues briefing, a distressed young woman flees a large building in New York City)\nSUSAN PRATT: Taxi. Taxi! (rushing into traffic, she is nearly struck as she fails to hail a cab)\nBROYLES: We've recently developed evidence which suggests Z.F.T. is funded by an unlikely source, and a name I'm sure you've all heard of... William Bell, Founder and Chairman of Massive Dynamic.\nSUSAN PRATT: Wait. Wait. Hold the bus! (barely catches a ride) You go up Park, right? Past Lenox Hill Hospital?\nBUS DRIVER: Yeah, six stops away. Are you feeling okay?\nSUSAN PRATT: Fine. Let's just go, please. (finds a seat)\nBROYLES: Those of you assembled in this room now have a single, clear-cut goal - to provide actionable evidence establishing a link between William Bell and Z.F.T. Special Agents Olivia Dunham and Charlie Francis will be assigning you to teams and coordinating the investigation. All efforts and information go through them. Now let's go to work.\nSUSAN PRATT: (in growing discomfort) Stop the bus. Stop the bus, please. I have to get off now.\nBUS DRIVER: Ma'am, will you please sit down? I'm not allowed...\nSUSAN PRATT: ...please stop the bus. I have to get off now.\nBUS DRIVER: Okay, okay.\nSUSAN PRATT: Open the door! (she exits the bus) Oh, my god. Please, please help. Somebody. Oh, my god. I can't breathe. Oh, my god.\nNEARBY PEDESTRIAN: Lady, you okay?\n(seconds later, she becomes engulfed in flames and flares into a large fireball)\nPETER: Find anything new and exciting in there, Walter?\nWALTER: (studies the manifesto) Huh?\nPETER: Well, you've read the manifesto about a dozen times cover to cover - So, just wondering.\nWALTER: I need to show you something, Peter.\nASTRID: (walks in) Hey.\nPETER: Hey.\nASTRID: What's going on?\nPETER: I don't know. Show and tell, apparently. (Walter types) What is this? I don't know what I'm looking at.\nWALTER: This typewriter's Belly's. I remember the day he purchased it. It was raining.\nPETER: Do you understand what you're saying, Walter? That William Bell doesn't just fund Z.F.T., he wrote their manifesto, and is actual responsible for everything that's been happening?\nWALTER: Absolutely not. William Bell was many things. He was ambitious. He was egotistical. He was temperamental. But he wasn't a madman. Although the ideas in his manifesto are radical, he wouldn't do this \u2013 this - these horrendous things. He would never do it. There are references all throughout to the chapter of ethics. But there is no such chapter. It is missing. And I believe that someone has removed it to suit their own evil purposes. And I can prove it.\nPETER: How?\nWALTER: Get another copy of the book. One with all the pages.\nPETER: There is no other copy. This is the only one.\nASTRID: (phone rings) I'll get it.\nWALTER: He wrote it here... in - in this lab. The \u2013 the - it could still be here somewhere - the original.\nPETER: And what if you're wrong?\nWALTER: I'm not wrong. And when I find it, you will see. It will absolve him, Peter.\nPETER: Peter, it's Olivia. (on phone)\nCHARLIE: So this is what I've got so far. Bus driver called 9-1-1, reported an agitated woman got off his bus. Moments later, she caught fire and exploded. Police combed the area. They couldn't find any evidence of an accelerant or an incendiary device.\nPETER: If there's something strange in your neighborhood...\nWALTER: ...who you gotta call?\nOLIVIA: So what do you make of this, Walter?\nWALTER: Well, from what Agent Francis described, it's possible we're dealing with a case of spontaneous human combustion.\nPETER: Thought that was just a myth.\nWALTER: Oh, myth is just an unverified fact.\nPETER: Maybe she was hit by a tiny meteor.\nWALTER: It's also possible. Until I get this body back to the lab, I won't be able to say anything with absolute certainty.\nOLIVIA: Alright, I'll get the coroner to prep the bodies for transport.\nWALTER: Bodies? Is there another somewhere?\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: (one of two corpses vanishes from her sight) Yea... I just...\nBROYLES: (picks-up phone in office) Broyles. (listens) Send her in.\nNINA: Phillip.\nBROYLES: Nina.\nNINA: I won't play coy, Phillip. I understand the FBI has opened an investigation into Massive Dynamic. As you can imagine, we spend a lot of money on counter-intelligence. And any probe into our finances raises red flags. So... What are you fishing for? Industrial espionage? Treaty violations?\nBROYLES: We have evidence that indicates William Bell may be involved with several biological attacks perpetrated this past year.\nNINA: But that's ridiculous.\nBROYLES: Perhaps. But as long as you're here, if you have something to offer, now would be the time.\nNINA: I'm not one of your street thugs that you can bully, Phillip. And William Bell is not a terrorist.\nBROYLES: I'd like to hear him tell me that himself.\nNINA: I'm afraid that's not possible. He's traveling. You're wasting your time. William Bell is not the enemy.\nBROYLES: (as Nina storms out) Is there something else?\nWALTER: Matter is just energy waiting to happen. The average adult at rest contains enough potential energy to explode with the force of five very large hydrogen bombs.\nPETER: You know, theoretically, you're actually right?\nWALTER: Ho ho ho ho! My son finally agrees with me! Uh, Agent Farnsworth, take a note of that.\nPETER: Unfortunately, we're just not very good at releasing it.\nWALTER: No. It needs a spark, of course - a trigger.\nASTRID: So what do you think would've released it in her?\nWALTER: Some say a particle is to blame - the appropriately named 'pyroton'. Maybe we could finally prove that it exists. Peter! Fire up the electron microscope!\nPETER: Uh, about that, I might've taken that apart.\nWALTER: What on Earth for?\nPETER: I needed the parts for a project I'm working on.\nWALTER: (angry) As I said, potential for destruction in each of us is infinite!\nBROYLES: (busy on the phone as Olivia enters his office) Yes, Jim, I understand. Right away.\nOLIVIA: I had you pegged as a creature of habit. (smiling) You changed your office.\nBROYLES: (bewildered) Come again.\nOLIVIA: Your desk. You moved it. Uh, we know from the driver what stop she got on. He's worked up an artist sketch rendering. So we'll canvass the area, see if we can I.D. her.\nBROYLES: What about the other victim? Did the bus driver see her get on too? Were they not together?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. You mean one. There was only one victim.\nBROYLES: I'm confused. (hands her a photo with a second victim)\n(she turns as someone enters the room behind her. her vision ends. the furniture is as it was as her supervisor walks in)\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham. Where are we on this?\nOLIVIA: (disoriented) Uh, the bus driver remembered what stop she, uh... what stop she got on. He gave us an artist sketch rendering. We're gonna show it around and see if we can I.D. her.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (barges into the office) What the hell is going on here?\nBROYLES: Sanford.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Why is the entire thirteenth floor trying to link William Bell to biological terror attacks?\nBROYLES: We have evidence that Bell might be implicated.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Yeah, I know what you have. You have testimony from a dead man who himself was an admitted terrorist.\nOLIVIA: Well, his testimony confirms what we've long suspected. Massive Dynamic may be involved or behind the events we've been witnessing.\nSANFORD HARRIS: William Bell and Massive Dynamic are the Defense Department's largest contractors. These waters are much too deep for a fishing expedition.\nOLIVIA: Are you seriously suggesting that we just ignore--\nSANFORD HARRIS: I am telling you to drop this - considering that you have nothing more than an unsubstantiated report from a hostile source. Clear? (walks out)\nOLIVIA: Are we really going to\u2026\nBROYLES: \u2026no. Get more evidence.\nWALTER: Just four centimeters. Ugh. (removes the jaw from the corpse)\nASTRID: You know, Walter, working with you, it's amazing the sort of things you get used to.\nWALTER: You're not the first person to tell me that.\nASTRID: Wow. Looks like somebody could've flossed more. Okay. Let's just hope that she has her dental records on file.\nWALTER: File. Of course. hmm? My filing system. Perhaps that's where I hid the manifesto!\nASTRID: You mean like how you seal things in the walls of your old house? Or how you squirrel things away in random deposit boxes around the country? I would hardly call that a 'filing system'.\nWALTER: I was prone to hide things because I was afraid that someone would unlock all my secrets. I didn't realize that the someone would be me. Where's my geiger counter? I left it here.\nASTRID: What, you think a radiation detector's gonna help you find the manifesto?\nWALTER: No. But I find that the rhythmic ticking - it emits helps me think.\nASTRID: Oh, Walter, Peter actually cannibalized that for his project too.\nWALTER: Oh, no, look, this has got to stop. Lab rule number one, do not borrow Walter's equipment without asking!\nASTRID: Walter, we found a match on the victim. Her name is Susan Pratt.\nOLIVIA: (to the building superintendant as he lets them in the apartment) Thank you. We'll take it from here.\nCHARLIE: Susan Pratt. She's 29 years old. Single. Worked for a New York Highway Department - tollbooth operator.\nOLIVIA: That's a lonely line of work.\nCHARLIE: Doesn't look like she had much of a social life either. She's definitely a table for one. (inspects tiny kitchenette) Hey, Liv. You think there's something wrong with her?\nOLIVIA: (reviews books on shelf) What do you mean? (inspects closet full of gray and black clothing)\nCHARLIE: You know, good-looking woman in the prime of her life. No evidence of a boyfriend. Or any friends for that matter. Just doesn't exactly strike me as being normal.\nOLIVIA: Well, I guess that depends on what your definition of normal is.\nCHARLIE: Liv.\nOLIVIA: (from a drawer) Hey, Charlie, I think I found something. She has a $30,000 check from an Isaac Winters.\nCHARLIE: I found something too. I think you should take a look at this. (entering a charred bathroom)\nOLIVIA: What the hell happened to her?\nPETER: Walter, I'm back.\nWALTER: Did you get it?\nPETER: No, I told you they don't have it.\nWALTER: Has to be Frankenberry -- that's what I ate back then -- If I'm to remember where I hid the manuscript, it's simple sense memory, Peter.\nPETER: But they don't have it. For all we know, they don't even make it anymore. I did, however, get you this. All the artificial sugary sweetness a growing scientist needs.\nWALTER: Hello, Agent Dunham! Let me guess, you're a Cornflakes gal. Am I correct?\nOLIVIA: Uh, yeah. Uh\nOLIVIA: So we went to the victim's apartment and there appears to be evidence of other fires.\nPETER: So the bus stop wasn't her first incident.\nOLIVIA: No. Walter. Does that mean something to you?\nWALTER: It changes everything. We can rule out spontaneous human combustion. For one, I mean, that's strictly a one-off event as you can imagine.\nPETER: So what does it rule in?\nWALTER: Pyrokinesis.\nPETER: Stop. There's no time for jokes, Walter.\nOLIVIA: Pyrokinesis?\nPETER: It's not even a real word. It was made up by Steven King. You ever see Firestarter with Drew Barrymore? Little girl who can start fires with her mind?\nWALTER: Mister King coined the term, but the phenomenon existed long before that. It's not that complicated, really. It's merely a form of telekinesis. The ability to move objects with the mind.\nPETER: Merely?\nWALTER: However, with pyrokinetics, they can excite objects at a molecular level. Well - well, look, think--think of--of--of each of these grains of cereal as a molecule. (shakes box) Uh, as the molecules start to vibrate more quickly, they generate heat. Energy. Until that energy must be released! (spills cereal)\nPETER: Agh. It's a fascinating demonstration, Walter. But it still doesn't explain why it is that Susan Pratt blew up.\nWALTER: I suspect this was a newfound ability. Well, it--it--it takes training to generate a heat source outside of the body. Without proper control, the energy is turned inward. You see? She had no other options.\nPETER: So you think that she had a choice to either blow somebody else up or blow herself up.\nWALTER: Yes. But this poor woman had yet to master her ability. Which made her a powder keg. Emotional stress, agitation, any high anxiety would set her off.\nOLIVIA: So where does this ability come from? Is it that she was just born different or is it something that someone did to her?\nWALTER: That is the real question now, isn't it?\nPETER: I'm not cleaning that up, by the way. (cereal mess)\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: (from the office) We got a hit from that check you found in Susan Pratt's apartment. Uh, it was cut from a law firm. Signed by Isaac Winters. He has an office in Charlestown.\nCHARLIE: No movement. Why am I not surprised you brought one of those? (lock pick)\nOLIVIA: Because you know me too well. (picks lock)\nCHARLIE: If we get caught, I don't know you at all. (inspects abandoned office) Looks like somebody left in a hurry.\nANSWERING MACHINE: You have four new messages.\nSUSAN PRATT: Mister Winters, this is Susan. Susan Pratt. You told me to call you if anything odd started happening. Well, it did, after I took the tests. Please call me back.\nCHARLIE: I'm gonna call ERT, have them dust for prints.\nSUSAN PRATT: Mister Winters, it's Susan again. You told me - you told me not to talk to anybody, but I'm scared. What's happening to me?\n- - - - (curbside, an ambulance races past Olivia as she has a vision of many of the downtown highrise structures ablaze)\nLOUDSPEAKER: Proceed to the nearest emergency shelter. Attention all citizens. Evacuate the area now. Proceed to the nearest emergency shelter. This is not a test.\nCHARLIE: (startling her from her trance) Hey, Liv. You okay?\nWALTER: You sure you haven't had any LSD? Mescaline? Magic mushrooms?\nOLIVIA: It wasn't a drug trip, Walter.\nWALTER: Well, visual hallucinations could be caused by a number of things. Could you look straight ahead, please? Sleep deprivation, a concussion, brain tumor.\nOLIVIA: I feel like I'm losing my mind.\nWALTER: Oh, I don't think so. If you were actually going insane, you'd likely have no idea what's happening. Take it from me. When did these episodes start? How did they feel?\nOLIVIA: First with Susan Pratt's body. Then it was in Broyles' office. The other on the street. The same people, the same places, but bleak. The, uh, the city was on fire.\nWALTER: Fascinating. There's another possibility, but it's a bit complicated. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nOLIVIA: It wasn't d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, Walter. Not even close.\nWALTER: Typical protracted d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Prolonged. You're familiar with the -- the pliability of space-time, yes?\nPETER: Of course. Who isn't?\nWALTER: One minute will explain. (rolls out a chalkboard) Most of us experience life as a - a linear progression just like this. (draws a horizontal line) But this is an illusion because every day, life presents us with an array of choices. As a result, life should look more like this. (draws diagonal branches from the first line) And each choice... leads to a new path. To go to work. To stay home. And each choice we take creates a new reality. Do -- do you understand?\nOLIVIA: Yes. But what does it have to do with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\nWALTER: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is--is--is simply a - a momentary glimpse to the other side. Almost everyone experiences it. We feel that we've been somewhere before because actually we have - in another reality. It's another path. The road not taken.\nOLIVIA: Walter, why me? Why am I seeing these visions?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what about William Bell's drug trials? Cortexiphan. You said that it worked on perception.\nWALTER: Yes.\nOLIVIA: If it's true - and I was part of the trials when I was a kid, is it possible that it's causing these visions?\nWALTER: I don't know. But what I do know is that you are a committed investigator. You're a perceptive agent. If you are having these visions, whatever they are, there must be a reason. Trust me.\nPETER: Really Walter? ...from a man who routinely sees little green men prancing through the lab with Tam o'Shanters on?\nASTRID: (interrupts) Hey, I think I found something. (hands Olivia an image of a charred body) It's another victim who died the same way Susan Pratt did. I checked it out and the guy who runs the web site lives in Malden.\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: (answers door buzzer) Yes.\nOLIVIA: Uh, my name's Olivia Dunham. I'm a Special Agent with the FBI. We need to speak to Emmanuel Grayson.\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: May I see your credentials, please? (she holds them to the view hole in the door)\nOLIVIA: (seated inside) Mister Grayson, you operate a web site Called \"Galaxy Truths\" where you claim to uncover conspiracies perpetrated by foreign governments.\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: I don't claim. I accomplish. Unlike you two. You're just pawns being used by the government to spread their propaganda.\nOLIVIA: Look, I can appreciate your opinion, Mr. Grayson. I just wanted to ask you a few...\nPETER: (aggressively) ...no, no. Look. Look. You're right, okay? She's a Fed, but I'm not. I'm just like you. I am a citizen in search of the truth. (to Olivia) Give me the photo. We downloaded this off of your web site. It claims that this person was a victim of spontaneous human combustion. Now you gotta tell us, where did this one happen?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Budapest. Three weeks ago. The victim was an American graduate student on holiday. The Hungarian police say he was attacked and set on fire. That's not the truth.\nOLIVIA: Why do you say that?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Are you familiar with William Bell?\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: William Bell killed these people.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: William Bell's company Massive Dynamic is a cover for all manner of unethical behavior. Multi-national, outside the purview of government control. He founded it to continue his experiments with impunity. Among them, secret drug trials. This was one of his test subjects.\nOLIVIA: Then why would William Bell have him killed?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Well, he didn't. At least not intentionally. You see, Bell is trying to activate his subjects to see which ones were successful. Some can handle the process. Others can't.\nOLIVIA: What process?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: To create super soldiers.\nOLIVIA: Super soldiers?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Yes. Like Khan Noonien Singh. To defend us in a coming war.\nOLIVIA: What war?\nPETER: I'm sorry. The Khan?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Yes.\nPETER: As in The Wrath of...\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Yes.\nPETER: Let me guess. This war, it's against...\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: The Romulans. Renegade Romulans from the future. Here to change the timeline. The sworn enemy of The Federation.\nPETER: The Federation? That would be the United Federation of Planets?\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Yes.\nPETER: hmm. And you know all this because?...\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: I am the son of Sarek.\nPETER: Which makes you Spock.\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Yes.\nPETER: Well Mister Spock, thank you for your time. We'll let you get back to the bridge now.\nEMMANUEL GRAYSON: Live long and prosper.\nNINA: Okay, yes, you were right. But see that? I'm a big enough girl to admit when I'm wrong. (listens) Oh, but I think we can prepare for that possibility. It shouldn't be a problem. (call-waiting alerts her to another call) Uh, Mister Prime Minister, I'm very sorry, would you mind holding for just a moment? (listens) Thanks. (switches to new caller) Hello. (listens) When? (listens. slightly startled) Well, no. Don't do that. Don't do anything until I get there. (switches to original call) Sir, I'm so sorry. Something has just come up. If you'll excuse me. (listens) Yes. You too. (ends call. then to her driver) Get me to the helicopter fast.\nOLIVIA: What if we're overlooking something? What if Emmanuel Grayson was right?\nPETER: About which part? Being from Planet Vulcan?\nOLIVIA: No. Forget that. But some of what he said made sense. We already know that William Bell conducted drug trials with experimental drugs. Cortexiphan for one.\nPETER: Do you have anything stronger for my coffee?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Bottom drawer. The cabinet behind you.\nPETER: And here I was halfway kidding. What?\nOLIVIA: What your father said about me having these visions for a reason. Maybe there's a clue in them that I'm meant to find.\nPETER: Meaning what?\nOLIVIA: We have one victim. Susan Pratt. But in my visions, there are always two bodies.\nPETER: Who are they?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. Unidentified. But maybe if I could get back to that parallel universe, as Walter describes, I can I.D. that second charred body. Maybe what's happening there could help us understand what's happening here.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (slips into the room and the private conversation) Happening where?\nOLIVIA: Nowhere.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Your new assignment. (hands her a paper)\nPETER: Always a pleasure seeing you, sir. (raises his mug)\nOLIVIA: (reads the paper and storms down the hall after him) Hey. Wait a sec. Harris. Can you stop? You want me to submit for a psych exam?\nSANFORD HARRIS: That's right. I'm concerned for you.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nSANFORD HARRIS: I've read your briefs. And I'd say your analysis borders on the paranoid. Besides which, your behavior's been noted as erratic and driven by emotion and not just by me.\nOLIVIA: ...oh that is not what this is about! My colleagues need to trust me. They need to depend on me. Not wonder in the back of their minds whether or not I'm losing mine.\nSANFORD HARRIS: ...look, this job is intense.\nOLIVIA: This has got nothing to do with my ability to do my job. This is about something else. This is about you and me.\nSANFORD HARRIS: This is exactly what I'm talking about because right now, you are acting emotionally.\nOLIVIA: Yes, you're right, I am. You know, I've tried to move past our history. I've tried to reason with you in the interest of a working relationship. But you seem to get off on this. So fine. I don't give a damn anymore. But I am not going to let you undermine my ability to do my job.\nSANFORD HARRIS: You can color this any way you like, Dunham. But I am still your superior officer and that evaluation is a direct order.\n(Olivia heads down the hall away from Harris and crumbles the letter as she reaches the situation room when - another vision starts, the phone rings, and changes color. The agents are suddenly very active. Charlie is barely audible but becomes clearer as Olivia approaches)\nAGENT FRANCIS: We need to get their statements... you put a shoot to kill order out on the perps. You understand me? Don't get close to them.\nOLIVIA: (getting his attention) Charlie.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah, what's up?\nOLIVIA: Uh, I was wondering where we were on the Susan Pratt case.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Pratt - nowhere. Same place we were yesterday.\nOLIVIA: I'd like to look again.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You have half of Boston in quarantined lockdown - and you're worried about a pair of charred twins?\nOLIVIA: Twins? (she looks at the photo he hands her. two corpses suddenly change to one corpse as her vision ends and she bumps into a busy coworker)\nNID AGENT: Sorry. Didn't see you.\n- - - -\nCHARLIE: We already ran Susan's bio, and we didn't find a sister.\nOLIVIA: I know.\nCHARLIE: Now what makes you think...\nTECH AGENT: ...look. You were right. Nancy Lewis. It says here that she had a twin sister who went missing eleven years ago.\nCHARLIE: Maybe she just ran away. Changed her identity.\nOLIVIA: She must've been running pretty hard. Where does Nancy live?\nTECH AGENT: She's local. 934 Whittier.\nOLIVIA: Thanks, Charlie.\nNANCY LEWIS: (answers a knock at her apartment door) Hi. Can I help you?\nISACC WINTERS: Nancy Lewis, my name is Isaac Winters.\nOLIVIA: (arriving at front door of Lewis' apartment and knocking) Nancy Lewis? FBI... we need to ask you some questions. (to Peter) It's unlocked. (enters with pistol drawn to find disarray) Nancy? (searching the room)\nPETER: Coffee's still hot.\nOLIVIA: (calls on cell phone) Uh, this is Dunham. I need immediate forensic dispatch to 934 Whittier. Apartment 210.\nPETER: Dunham. Take a look at this. (at the window) This glass has been melted.\nOLIVIA: You think she's starting fires like her sister? What is it?\nPETER: I got an idea.\n- - as the forensics team roams the apartment - -\nOLIVIA: (quietly on her cell phone) I'm not sure.\nPETER: (returns with a glass cutter) I've got it.\nMISTER PROTOCOL: (to Peter) Please don't touch that window. We haven't pulled prints yet.\nPETER: You're not gonna need to.\nMISTER PROTOCOL: I think the protocols and the processing of evidence are pretty clear.\nPETER: Let me guess, you're new around here.\nOLIVIA: Is everything alright?\nPETER: Yeah, everything's fine. Just tell Mister Protocol to let me do my job, please.\nOLIVIA: (to Mister Protocol) Uh, it's okay. He's with me. Are you, uh, ever gonna tell me what it is that you are actually doing?\nPETER: Help me with this first. Hold the glass up here. Gently. (as he scribes a foot wide circle of glass from the window)\nWALTER: (arriving at the crime scene with equipment. to Astrid) I sure hope this is important... I was just about to take my bath.\nPETER: Hey. You have any problem taking it apart?\nASTRID: Walter tried to take back the electron microscope. But I convinced him that you needed it. So what's going on?\nPETER: Nancy Lewis was kidnapped. We're gonna figure out who did it.\nWALTER: (as Peter assembles the equipment, Walter finds a photo in the apartment) I've seen this woman before. But why does she look so familiar?\nPETER: Maybe because you dissected her twin sister yesterday. Remember? Blond girl about 5'- 7\". Really well done. Melted fillings.\nWALTER: Oh, right.\nPETER: Astrid can you plug that in to the DVI input?\nASTRID: (takes electrical lead) Yes.\nPETER: Okay. Here's the deal. Walter, the project that I've been working on was for you.\nWALTER: For me?\nPETER: It reconstructs audio. I wanted you to be able to digitize some of those old water-damaged vinyl records you have. I know how much the mean to you.\nWALTER: Thank you, son. (to Astrid) You know, when he was five, he -- he built me a popsicle napkin holder. Dreadful design. Utterly useless.\nPETER: Thank you.\nWALTER: But this -- this is...\nPETER: You're welcome. Anyway, the basic principles at work here are very simple. You all know how a record player works, right?\nASTRID: Yeah. A needle goes over the grooves of the vinyl and the vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound.\nPETER: Exactly. So the principle is the same. Except for instead of a needle, I use the electron microscope to take a high resolution, digital image of the grooves on the surface of the record. That image is then transferred into the computer, which translates it back into audio that we can hear.\nASTRID: You sound just like him.\nPETER: I'm guessing that with the software modifications I gave you, we're gonna be able to do the same thing with this.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that you can play back the glass somehow.\nPETER: Yeah. Walter says that these pyrotechnic abilities only occur during times of emotional stress. I think that when our twin was kidnapped, the heat that she generated 'caused that window to liquefy slightly. Which means that any sound that was in this room at that time would've left microscopic impressions in the molten glass.\nASTRID: Like the grooves on a record.\nPETER: Exactly right. Now if you'll please scan the glass.\nASTRID: Okay. You're ready to go.\nPETER: Alright. So it's transferring into the sound processor now. Let's see what we got. (a loud, sharp sonic wave pierces the room and the glass that is being tested breaks)\nWALTER: That could've been one of my records.\nPETER: It's okay. It's okay. I already have a digital scan of the glass in here. Let's try that again, shall we? Just slow it down. I don't understand. It should be working. (sounds are easier to understand)\nWALTER: Yes. Yes. Now attenuate for ambient noise. (Peter turns a knob and a voice is audible)\nNANCY LEWIS: (digital recording reveals a physical struggle) Get out of here. Stay away. What do you want?! Please!\nWALTER: (saddened) Poor dear.\nOLIVIA: Peter, can you play it back from when he starts to talk?\nPETER: Yeah. One sec. (rewinds)\nOLIVIA: Okay, just there. Where he's dialing. (opens her cell phone) Okay, can you make that clearer?\nPETER: Sure. Let me just isolate the sound. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\nOLIVIA: (she records the dialing sequence from the abduction of Lewis) My cell phone app can dial the number from the tones. (she replays the tones and blind dials to...)\nSANFORD HARRIS: (answering his cell phone) This is Harris.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (walking out of the situation room) Hey Charlie. I'm headed out for a few hours. If anybody needs me, I'm reachable by cell.\nCHARLIE: You got it. (picks up phone to make a call as Harris exits)\nOLIVIA: (curbside in her vehicle as Harris emerges) I got him, Charlie. He's headed West.\nCHARLIE: I'm right behind you. (exits the building and enters a separate vehicle)\nOLIVIA: (after following Harris for minutes in her vehicle, on her radio) Charlie, he's approaching a warehouse off Moore and Adams.\nCHARLIE: Roger that. We're turning onto Adams right now. (parks near Olivia as she watches through binoculars. approaches her vehicle and knocks on her window)\nOLIVIA: Hey. He used a remote to get in.\nCHARLIE: I guess we go with the old-fashioned way. (the team jimmies-open a door to the warehouse and enters with pistols drawn.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (walks to a control panel and looks into an isolation room) Where are we?\nISAAC WINTERS: (monitoring Nancy Lewis strapped to a bed) No thermal activity yet. Her body temperature's normal. We'll know more soon.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Well, he's losing patience. We need her active. Get it done.\n(split into two teams of two, Olivia and Charlie search separate parts of the warehouse. Olivia finds a room with pictures of victims on the wall. she notes that her picture prominently displayed, as well. her tactical partner is dropped by two gunshots from a guard. hidden in the room she exits and shoots the guard.\nCHARLIE: (on the radio) Liv, I heard gunshots. You okay?\nOLIVIA: Charlie, we've got a man down. (she continues her search further into the warehouse and is shot at by Winters. she returns fire, hitting him in the chest) Charlie, I've got her. Back Northwest corner. (she explores further and finds the isolation room. (to Lewis) I'm Olivia. I am with the FBI.\nNANCY LEWIS: (gasping) help me. Please.\nOLIVIA: Don't worry. You're going to be okay. (unaware of Harris' presence, Olivia is locked into the room with Lewis) No! (bangs the door) Harris, open the door! (marches to the observation window, plants herself in front of Harris and aims her pistol at him, point-blank) God Damn it Harris! Open the door. (she fires twice into the safety glass with no effect)\nNANCY LEWIS: I can't breathe. (hyperventilating)\nSANFORD HARRIS: (taunting her over the intercom) Well, look at that. Good work, Agent Dunham. You managed to activate her before we could.\nOLIVIA: Damn it, Harris, open the door. She needs help.\nSANFORD HARRIS: Not if she can control it. And if not, she'll explode and kill the both of you. So one problem solves another.\nNANCY LEWIS: aaah! I'm burning up!\nOLIVIA: You're gonna be okay. Just calm down. Just calm down.\nNANCY LEWIS: I'm burning up. okay.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (on his cell phone) Yeah, it's me. I need to speak to him.\nOLIVIA: Hold on. I'm gonna get you out of here.\nSANFORD HARRIS: It worked. She's hot. We have an active. But she's a loss. She's highly unstable.\nNANCY LEWIS: Why is this happening to me? I don't understand.\nOLIVIA: They did something to you -- maybe to both of us a long time ago when we were just kids. And right now you're feeling the effects from that. But you can control this, okay? You can control this and I'm gonna help you. I just need you to focus the heat away from us.\nNANCY LEWIS: I can't.\nOLIVIA: Yes, you can. Just focus. Focus on anything. Just focus, Nancy. You can do this, Nancy.\nNANCY LEWIS: I can't.\nOLIVIA: You can.\nSANFORD HARRIS: (still on phone in other room) Yeah, I'll take care of it. There won't even be a trace. (begins to sway in distress as Lewis stares at him) I, uh, uh... (his arm ignites, then the observation room explodes through the safety window into the isolation room. Olivia drags Lewis to the ground, barely avoiding the fireball)\nOLIVIA: (sitting-up in the aftermath) Oh! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Oh, yeah. You're gonna be okay. (hugs Lewis as she sobs) Oh, it's okay. It's okay.\nPETER: (excuses himself from the table in an upscale bake shop) Okay. I think you got all of that, Walter. I'm gonna use the bathroom. Be right back. (to an employee as he finds his way to the back) 'scuse me, could you keep an eye on him... make sure he doesn't leave?\nWALTER: (to Olivia as she approaches from another direction) Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Where's Peter?\nWALTER: Peter's in the bathroom.\nOLIVIA: (sits down with him) What the hell did you people do to us? (opens a portfolio, removes and displays photos) You and William Bell, Walter. What did you do to me? Susan Pratt and Nancy Lewis are from Jacksonville, Florida. Just like Nick Lane, the guy that you conducted drug trials on when he was a kid. The drug trials that you conducted on me.\nWALTER: They were Belly's. They were his trials.\nOLIVIA: You knew. Walter, you were there and you knew.\nWALTER: We were trying to help. We meant no harm.\nOLIVIA: No harm? You were drugging children. Three-year-old children, Walter. Why did you do it?\nWALTER: We were trying to prepare you. To make you capable. Able. Something terrible is coming.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what did you do to us?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nOLIVIA: Damn it, Walter, you do!\nWALTER: No, I don't. I don't. I - I can't remember. I'm sorry. (as she gathers the photos and departs the way she came in)\nPETER: (returns to the table after a only a short while to find Walter nearly in tears) Hey. Hey. Walter. What just happened?\n(Olivia returns to her vehicle and sits in solemn reflection)\nBROYLES: (answers the ring at his front door) Nina. What is it?\nNINA: These were all taken in the last twenty-four hours. (displays pictures containing The Observer) You know what happened the last time he appeared with this kind of frequency. We need to talk.\n(after playing one of his old phonograph recordings, Walter has a glimmer in his eye as he locates a document in an old file box)\nWALTER: (responding to the door closing, without looking to see who has entered) Astrid, I found it. The original manuscript with the extra pages. I was right. Listen to this. '...Our children are our greatest resource. We must nurture them and protect them. We must prepare them so they can one day protect us.' You see, I was...\nTHE OBSERVER: Hello, Walter.\nWALTER: (casually) Oh. Hello.\nTHE OBSERVER: (stoic) It's time to go.\nWALTER: (humbly) Is it time? I'll get my coat.\n(approaching locked doors in an elegant condominium, Nina is rung in by the doorman)\nNINA: Evening. (to the doorman as she hails and enters the elevator)\n(as she exits the elevator, two large men wearing ski masks approach her. one levels a silenced pistol at her chest and fires)"

BP is dropping, 80 over 50. Pulse 120.\nDOCTOR: Breath sounds?\nEMT #1: Decreased on the left side, labored but stable.\nDOCTOR: Get me a chest scan.\nEMT #1: Doctor... there's something else. (exposes a damaged robotic arm)\nOLIVIA: (enters the situation room) Sir, I just heard about Nina Sharp. Do we know who shot her?\nBROYLES: We\u2019re trying to figure that out. The security guard and doorman in the lobby are dead. No I.D. on the gunman.\nOLIVIA: Is she gonna be\u2026\nBROYLES: \u2026too early to say.\nAGENT: (holding phone) Sir. No official statement from Massive Dynamic or William Bell.\nBROYLES: Thanks. That's no surprise. If they say the C.O.O. was shot, their stock will take a hit.\nCHARLIE: (points to a monitor) Hey Liv, security footage just came in. We had video tech assemble the three video cameras. They shoot the night guy, they replace him\u2026 then this guy comes in and they all head upstairs.\nNINA: (on video footage, greets her doorman) Evening.\nCHARLIE: Nina Sharp comes in six minutes later. (image of Nina collapsing back into the elevator. her assailants follow) Then it goes black for four minutes.\nOLIVIA: What did he do to her?\nGARBLED VOICE: Take out do it here. Take out the we can do it here.\nBROYLES: Whatever it was, it only took them four minutes.\nCHARLIE: Who is he?\nOLIVIA: Can we enhance what he said?\nTECH AGENT: Sure.\nWEAK VOICE: Take out the camera. We can do it here. Take out the camera. We can do it here. Take out the camera. We can do it here.\nOLIVIA: Run it through voice recognition.\nSTRONGER VOICE: Take out the camera. We can do it here. Take out the camera. We can do it here.\nDAVID JONES: Take out the camera. We can do it here. Take out the camera--\nOLIVIA: (image and file appears on the monitor) David Robert Jones.\nOLIVIA: (privately with Broyles) Why is he wearing bandages and the others are wearing masks?\nBROYLES: Not easy to walk around when you're on half the world's watch list. Maybe he's recently tried to change his appearance.\nOLIVIA: But all our information suggests that Jones is working for Bell. So why shoot his number two? It doesn't make any sense.\nBROYLES: Maybe our information is wrong.\nOLIVIA: Why don't we go straight to the source and bring William Bell in for questioning now?\nBROYLES: At this point, I don't think that--\nOLIVIA: We have solid intelligence that William Bell is funding these horrific events that we've seen, most of which have been carried out by Jones.\nBROYLES: I'm not...\nOLIVIA: ...at this point, I don't care how powerful William Bell is or how deep his political connections go, he is not above the law.\nBROYLES: Dunham--\nOLIVIA: Sir, with all due respect, I have too much in this, professionally and personally, that if you stand in the way now, I --\nBROYLES: Dunham! I came in here to begin making the calls I'm going to need to make in order to get the interview that we both agree is necessary. And I would also request that you stop cutting me off every time I'm about to tell you to stop drilling, you've struck oil, as I was going to do when we first came through that door. (answers phone) This is Broyles. (listens, hangs up) Nina Sharp is out of surgery.\nASTRID: (to Peter as he arrives) Hey.\nPETER: Hey, where's Walter?\nASTRID: With you?\nPETER: unt-uh. I went to check on him this morning, his bed wasn't even slept in. I thought he'd worked here all night.\nASTRID: I thought he went home with you last night.\nOLIVIA: (just arriving) Hey, I need to talk to Walter. Is he here?\nPETER: Yeah, take a number.\nASTRID: I'm gonna check the cafeteria, see if he slept there again.\nPETER: Okay. (to Olivia) You don't look so good.\nOLIVIA: David Robert Jones shot Nina Sharp. I wanted to see if --\nPETER: (calling out) Hi--hi, it's Peter Bishop calling. I was wondering if you maybe have an eye on my father? He wondered off again. (listens) Yeah. Look, can you do me a favor? Could you go check down in the marine biology lab? He sometimes spends the night down there, cleaning out the tanks with Mrs. Ericson. No, I'll wait--I'll wait. Thank you.\nOLIVIA: Do you think he left because of what I said?\nPETER: You mean because of what he is referring to as 'the assault in the pastry shop?' I don't know, it's hard to say.\nOLIVIA: It was about Cortexiphan, Bell's trials. I wanted to see if Walter knew what Bell did to me.\nPETER: I know, he told me. You caught him off guard. And I understand you had your reasons for saying what it is that you had to say. And I know he understands that too.\nASTRID: (returning) He's not there. No one's seen him.\nPETER: (caller is back on the line) Hello. (listens) No luck, huh? Okay, well thanks for your help.\nOLIVIA: Peter... I -- I'm sorry that I was so hard on him.\nPETER: Don't worry about it. He's probably back at the hotel right now, working his way to the bottom of a pint of rocky road.\n(Walter visits a gravesite, The Observer waits nearby)\n(she awakens following surgery and looks at her spastic robotic arm. she is startled by a visitor)\nBROYLES: I think to repair that, one requires a special skill set.\nNINA: Phillip.\nBROYLES: You've been shot. We discovered it was Jones. You're lucky. Not too many gunshot victims have come through this way have Kevlar parts in their rib cage. You'll be up and about in no time. What did he want, Nina? What did he do to your arm?\nNINA: Get me Agent Dunham. I need to speak with her right away.\n(elsewhere, Jones and his crew stop at a busy city intersection and unload equipment)\nOLIVIA: (to the security detail outside of Nina's hospital room. flashes her badge and enters) Agent Dunham.\nBROYLES: (a team in medical garb hovers over Nina's bed) Specialists from Massive Dynamic.\nNINA: I'll be right with you, Agent Dunham.\nBROYLES: (sarcastically) Let's just say this treatment doesn't fall under an HMO.\nOLIVIA: No.\n(Jones continues to set up his equipment in the street)\nNINA: (out of bed and ambulatory) William Bell is not the problem, and he's certainly not the head of a terrorist organization.\nOLIVIA: Well, I'll make that judgment. Thank you.\nNINA: Well, it's true Jones used to work for William Bell 15 years ago. In fact, he was one of our first employees at Massive Dynamic. But he was let go.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nNINA: The details are not important. Suffice to say that Jones felt spurned by the rejection. William was a father figure to him, a respected mentor. I would go as far as to say that all the death and destruction that Jones has caused up until this point has been a way of proving something to William.\nOLIVIA: To prove what?\nNINA: Jones always felt that he was special and that no one recognized that, certainly not William.\nOLIVIA: So before the shooting, when was the last time you saw David Jones?\nNINA: Oh, I haven't seen him for years. But after he broke out of prison, he was contacting our offices, requesting meetings with Doctor Bell. Over the past few weeks, his calls have become... rather extreme.\nOLIVIA: You've been in contact with a known felon?\nNINA: It was an internal matter. Clearly we thought we could manage this better than we did.\nBROYLES: Apparently, Jones is ill, dying from the teleportation from his prison break. Nina believes Jones' agenda is to kill William Bell when he finds him.\nOLIVIA: Then Bell needs to come in. We need to put him into protective custody.\nNINA: Not possible.\nOLIVIA: Why not? Where is he?\nNINA: I can't say.\nOLIVIA: This is ridiculous.\nNINA: Listen to me Agent Dunham. I can't say because I don't know. I haven't seen William Bell for months. He's been communicating with me strictly electronically. But what I do know, though... is speaking with William Bell has become more than a professional matter for you. In fact, I'm counting on that. Stop Jones and I will personally arrange a meeting between you and Bell. But if Jones gets to Bell first, I'm afraid all the answers you're searching for... die with him.\nOLIVIA: What did Jones want from you? What did he do to you in the elevator?\nNINA: (looks at her arm) He stole a very powerful... energy cell that Doctor Bell hid within my arm.\nOLIVIA: What can he do with it?\nNINA: Unfortunately, the question is... what can't he do?\n(operating the power equipment, passers-by are distressed by the sonic pitch being created)\nJONES AIDE: Coordinate tracking is complete, sir. You can increase sonic frequency. It's locked in.\nDAVID JONES: Stabilize, damn it.\n(a rift appears on the street and a large truck drives through it from the other side)\nJONES AIDE: The coordinates are separating, sir. It's not working, they're still separating. We're losing it. We can't hold it open.\n(the truck drives through the rift and the anomaly collapses on the rear of the vehicle, shearing off the back of the trailer. the cab careens into traffic, strikes a car and skids to a halt, just feet from Jones)\nDAVID JONES: It's too thick here. These are the wrong coordinates. (stoically removing his glasses, he exposes he mangled face) Try again, please.\nTHE OBSERVER: Do you recognize this? (hands over a vintage coin)\nWALTER: How did you get that?\nTHE OBSERVER: This coin looks similar to the one you're thinking of. But it is from another place. There is more than one of everything. I have said too much, I am not supposed to get involved. I have taken you as far as I can. Does this house look familiar to you?\nWALTER: Yes.\nTHE OBSERVER: Do you remember what you have to find? (studies Walter's bewildered expression) You must try to remember. There isn't much time.\nBROYLES: (enters with a friend) Agent Astrid Farnsworth? I'd like you to meet Nina Sharp.\nASTRID: Hello. Uh... How are you feeling?\nNINA: The extent of my injuries was greatly exaggerated.\nBROYLES: We wanted to ask you a few questions about Doctor Bishop.\nASTRID: Okay.\nNINA: Has he been acting strange lately?\nASTRID: Walter acting strange... um... no stranger than usual.\nBROYLES: And did he speak to anyone, or has anyone recently contacted him that you've never heard of before?\nASTRID: No. Should I be concerned.\nPETER: (enters from a side room) Should she be?\nNINA: Peter, hello.\nPETER: Miss Sharp. So what's going on here?\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham told you about the attack by David Robert Jones?\nPETER: Yeah.\nNINA: Jones is in possession of something your father may... know something about.\nBROYLES: When was the last time either of you saw Doctor Bishop?\nPETER: It was last night. Why? You think Jones has something to do with his disappearance?\nASTRID: Doctor Bishop gets lost more often than you would imagine.\nBROYLES: mm. I'm sure you're right. (answers phone) This is Broyles.\nNINA: (phones the office) It's me, I need a Priority One grid search. Target is Walter Bishop.\nCHARLIE: (arriving) What the hell happened? Where's the other half of the truck?\nWITNESS #1: Suddenly, there was this shimmer, like a curtain almost, or a window.\nOLIVIA: My colleague said you saw a man with a machine... and what did it look like?\nWITNESS #2: The man was holding, like, this black square. Like it was scanning something.\nWITNESS #1: This truck, it just -- just came out of nowhere. It just appeared like it came through the window, and what was on the other side of it was different.\nWITNESS #2: It was emitting this sound, like a loud noise. It didn't look like it was doing anything, but, um... it did.\nOLIVIA: Do you remember what he looked like?\nWITNESS #2: No, he was wearing a mask.\nOLIVIA: Are you sure it was a mask and not bandages?\nWITNESS #2: Yeah, more like bandages.\nBROYLES: (to Peter) Take a look at this. (image retrieved from the fax)\nNINA: This image of your father was taken three hours ago, near East Douglas and Grafton. Massive Dynamic maintains access to all the cameras we manufacture. This security footage was from the local commuter train station.\nPETER: I think I'm starting to understand a little better. This is near a beach house that we own. Walter used to love it up there 'cause it's quiet. My father has had a particularly rough couple of days. I'm not sure that everything's making sense to him right now.\nNINA: We have agents canvassing the area. If you give us the address --\nPETER: Actually, if you don't mind, I'd rather go up there and bring him back myself. I think that's for the best right now.\nBROYLES: Of course.\nPETER: Thanks.\nFBI AGENT: Agent Francis... (hands over a sheet of paper) The driver died on impact. Blunt force trauma to the head. That's what we got so far.\nCHARLIE: You sure this is right?\nFBI AGENT: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: What?\nCHARLIE: The prints aren't coming back on the driver, the truck isn't registered in New York or anywhere else. The VIN number, the serial part numbers, they don't exist.\nOLIVIA: What does that mean?\nCHARLIE: This truck was never made. How is that possible? Where the hell did it come from?\nPETER: (drives up and walks in the open door) Walter? (looks at old keepsakes) Walter? (finds his father in a back room) Walter?\nWALTER: Hello, Peter.\nPETER: Walter, what are you doing here? You had us worried.\nWALTER: I'm looking for something. I think it... It might be in this house. And it's very important.\nPETER: Okay. What are you looking for?\nWALTER: I just can't recall, son. That's the thing.\nOLIVIA: You're not telling us everything. If Jones is looking for Bell, then what does an energy cell and a truck coming from nowhere have to do with it?\nNINA: Well nothing comes out of nowhere, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Then where does it come from?\nNINA: I think you already know that. And I think you already suspect where William Bell is.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying that you know where Bell is? Stop playing games with me. Tell me where he is, or I assure you I will turn this world over looking for him.\nNINA: Well, that's just the problem, Agent Dunham. William Bell is not in this world.\n(at a soccer field in Providence, play is vigorous. Jones arrives in his van)\nCHARLIE: You're saying that William Bell disappeared into a different universe? Like Dorothy going to Oz?\nOLIVIA: Well, Walter calls it an alternate reality. Do you understand?\nCHARLIE: Not remotely. You're saying that William Bell is not on this planet.\nNINA: No, he is. Just another version of this planet.\nOLIVIA: Have you ever had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\nCHARLIE: Living a moment you've already lived before? Yes. What does this have to do with where Bell is?\nOLIVIA: Well, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is like a glimpse into the other side. You feel like you've been somewhere before because actually in another reality you have.\nBROYLES: But d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is just a window. It's possible some individuals may be able to do more than just see into the other world. They may be able to travel there.\nOLIVIA: So the incident on the street -- that's why we can't identify the truck. Because it came from the other side.\nNINA: That's what Jones is using the energy cell for. He's trying to cross over, to get to Bell.\nBROYLES: (answers phone) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: (answers phone) It's Francis.\nBROYLES: (to caller) Where?\nPETER: Walter, just -- just calm down.\nWALTER: Yes, Peter. I started something a long time ago, I did -- I did, it's the truth, I did... and there is no getting past that!\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: (searches feverishly) And I have to finish it.\nPETER: Walter! Walter.\nWALTER: Damn it.\nPETER: I need you to take a breath and calm down.\nWALTER: In this damn house. It's so-- it's in my mind.\nPETER: Walter. I need you to take a deep breath.\nWALTER: How do you--? I can't find it and I don't know where to look. I don't know where to look... and it's so important to look. (kicks wall) I don't know where to look.\nPETER: Walter, Walter, where are you g -- Walter! Where are you going? Walter, look, it's getting late. We need to head back.\nWALTER: No, not yet. (calms down)\nPETER: You know, I remember when we used to come down here during the summers. Mom and I. You were always still working back in the city. I'd stand out here on the beach for hours, looking at the ocean. It used to seem like it went on forever. And on Saturdays... I'd always wake up just before my alarm. I could smell the pancakes... which meant that you were here. I'd creep down the stairs, and there'd you be... standing over the stove, flipping pancakes. You seemed so big back then. I'd just stand there watching you. And you'd always flip one of the pancakes.\nWALTER: I made them in the shape of whales. They were your favorite! Yes. Peter, I remember. Thank you. I know why I'm here. I know where it is.\nCHARLIE: Okay, so tell me exactly what you saw.\nSOCCER PLAYER: I was standing there by the field. Lance went back, you know, to get the ball. That's when I saw it. It's like a see-through wall appeared. It sort of shimmered, like a heat wave, you know? Like something was there, but it wasn't.\nCHARLIE: What do you mean it was there and it wasn't?\nSOCCER PLAYER: It was like a window, but warped. Then it shut.\nCHARLIE: Thanks you.\nOLIVIA: (approaches) Hey.\nCHARLIE: Okay. So him and his friend are playing soccer. Kid's running with the ball. All of a sudden they see a shimmer of light. Kid hits the shimmer, and then he just sort of collapses.\nOLIVIA: And did anyone see Jones?\nCHARLIE: No. But there's a bit more to go. (to the forensics technician) Go ahead. Okay. How does something like that happen? (Lance is uncovered and is missing his head, right arm and right shoulder) I can't believe I'm gonna be saying this. (in disbelief) Let's assume that Jones is trying to make this doorway into another universe...\nOLIVIA: ...Why here? I mean, first New York, now here. What do they have in common?\nOLIVIA: (enters the situation room) Hey Chad, what you got?\nAGENT CHAD: Third floor says they can't find a connection between the incident in New York and the one on the soccer field...\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I know. I know. Look, I want you to go through our database, and cross-reference any incidents connected to science, biology, or unexplained phenomenon and have the file sent to my office, please.\nAGENT CHAD: Dating back how far?\nOLIVIA: All of them.\nOLIVIA: (to the helpers bringing in stacks of files to her office) Uh, just put them down there, thank you. You can roll that one into the corner. (opens files and starts to post a master map of incidents)\nOLIVIA: (sees a pattern and heads to Broyles office to inform him) Sir, we need to call Nina Sharp. I think that I found a connection between what Jones did in New York - and that park in Providence.\nPETER: (as his father moves old storage items) Walter, tell me what you're looking for. (takes a stack of items) Here, I got it.\nWALTER: (discovers an old foot locker) Oh! It's still here. I was beginning to be afraid that... (finds a lock box inside with a vintage coin on top of the box) Peter, this is why we're here. (struggles to open it) It's locked.\n- - Nina joins Olivia in the research - -\nOLIVIA: This is a record of all local incidents related to The Pattern. Some of these go back more than twenty years.\nNINA: But we've done this ourselves at Massive Dynamic. A dozen of our top analysts have spent the better part of two years --\nOLIVIA: Yeah, and there's seemingly no obvious logic or predictability. It took me a while to see it myself. But... these are the spots where Jones used his device. Now look at this. (highlights locations on the monitor and computes a spoked pattern around several central locations) That can't be a coincidence.\nBROYLES: So what does it mean?\nNINA: I think I may know.\n- - The Bishops continue - -\nPETER: (picks the lock on the security box) Got it. (Walter removes a small, hand-held electronic device) What exactly is that?\nWALTER: When Belly and I were younger men, we regularly ingested large quantities of L.S.D.\nPETER: You don't say?\nWALTER: We became convinced what we saw while on the drug was real. We believed that we were catching glimpses of another reality, another world just like ours but slightly different, populated by slightly different versions of ourselves. We all experience it momentarily as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. And Belly and I could prolong it with hallucinogenics. But the question of course was -- how to get there without LSD. Belly, as you know, theorized that young children have the capacity to see these other worlds naturally.\nPETER: I know, you already told me about that. Bell's experiments with Cortexiphan.\nWALTER: Yes. He theorized that properly nurtured, these abilities could be heightened, intensified, and that in time his subjects may be able to travel from here to there.\nPETER: Over there? You mean an alternate world?\nWALTER: Around this time, something was lost to me, Peter. Something precious. I became convinced that if only I could cross over myself, then I could take from there what I had lost here.\nPETER: And what was the plan? You were just gonna open up a hole and then walk over to the other side?\nWALTER: No... it's not that simple. You have to find the right place first.\n- - Nina continues briefing Olivia and Broyles - -\nNINA: Finding the right place to cross over is the key. Doctor Bell once posited that our world has \u2018soft spots\u2019, places where the fundamental constants of nature -- the speed of light, gravity, the mass of a proton, for example -- have begun to decay. As a result, in these particular areas, the membrane between the realities is thinner, almost porous. The Bermuda Triangle is one, but there are others. And until recently, these areas were extremely rare.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean \"until recently\"? What happened?\nNINA: We happened, Agent Dunham. Scientific progress, advancing technologies... by meddling with the laws of nature, has hastened the decay of these constant fundamentals and increased the number of soft spots.\nBROYLES: So you're suggesting Jones is looking for one of these \u2018soft spots\u2019.\nNINA: Yes. In the belief that by releasing the right kind of energy, and aiming it exactly at the proper spot, he could effectively break through.\n- - Walter continues briefing Peter - -\nWALTER: Of course there's a problem opening a hole to another reality. In theory, that would also allow things from there to pass over here, which could be dangerous. And so -I also built a plug.\nPETER: A plug?\nWALTER: Actually more a patch to close the hole should the need ever arise. (holds out the device) This is that patch, Peter. This is what I had to find.\nPETER: Okay, just so I'm clear, somewhere out there, there is a hole to another reality, and you need to plug it?\nWALTER: Yes, I'm afraid so.\nPETER: Well, do you know where it is?\nWALTER: Yes. Yes, I do, Peter. Reiden. Reiden Lake.\n- - Nina offers to get more data for Olivia - -\nOLIVIA: We have to identify another soft spot, then we'll know where he's going.\nNINA: We should expand the search parameters. Did you map events beyond the Eastern Seaboard?\nOLIVIA: No, they're not in our database.\nNINA: I'll call my office and have the files transferred to your system.\nOLIVIA: Which of these events are the oldest? Do you remember? I mean, these events are somehow consequences of \u2018soft spots\u2019 --\nBROYLES: Well... these are the first recorded incidents. They all go back more than fifteen years.\nNINA: Becca's Meadow, that was the site of the first incident we know about.\nOLIVIA: Wait... all of these incidents point to here. (points to a hub location on the monitor) That's where he's going. Reiden Lake.\nDAVID JONES: Get all the gear, get set up. (his accomplices start unloading a small van in a wooded area) Come on, men. We're going to the other side.\nWALTER: It's just the other side of the lake, the place where I opened the hole.\nPETER: That's awfully convenient.\nWALTER: Not convenient at all. That's why I bought the beach house in the first place, the proximity. Come on, Peter. Can't you go faster? We may not have much time.\nPETER: After all these years, what's going to happen if we're not on time?\nWALTER: I don't know! But my friend came and he said we must. He only comes when it's of dire consequence.\nPETER: And what friend would that be?\nWALTER: The bald one.\nPETER: You mean the one that Olivia calls \u2018\u2019The Observer\u2019\u2019?\nWALTER: Yes.\nPETER: The man who attacked me in the woods.\nWALTER: He must've had a very good reason. I'm sure he didn't mean you any harm.\nPETER: What else aren't you telling me, Walter?\nWALTER: Lots, I'm sure, but none of it's relevant. Can't -- it's been so long. This all looks the same. Oh... Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter. Peter! Stop it! Stop! (approaching a familiar gate)\nPETER: Okay. Now what? (Walter takes the device out of the lockbox) That thing's not going to blow up, is it?\nWALTER: I certainly hope not. (hesitates. takes the coin from his pocket)\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: You may not remember this. When you were a boy, you were very sick, dying.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: And sometimes you got scared. And to calm yourself, to forget what you were going through, you took to collecting coins. This one, this was your favorite.\nPETER: You're right. I don't remember any of that.\nWALTER: I do.\nPETER: Walter!\n(both men are dragged quickly from the car by federal agents)\nOLIVIA: (running in a few seconds later) It's okay, It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. They're with me. Easy, easy. it's okay.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham...\nPETER: How did you know where we were?\nOLIVIA: What are you doing here?\nWALTER: We're trying to plug a hole in the universe. What are you doing here?\nOLIVIA: Apparently the same thing.\nPETER: But how did you...\nWALTER: ...oh no! (responding to a loud sonic tone further away in the wooded area)\nCHARLIE: What is that?\n(the law enforcement and science team run to the source of the sonic distortion and find a wavy disturbance in a clearing that is forming due to the efforts of Jones and his team, shots are fired and a charging agent falls)\nAGENT: Doctor Bishop, stay down.\nDAVID JONES: (in the chaos to his technician) Keep going please. Don't stop what you're doing. Hold them off as long as you can.\nCHARLIE: Olivia, I'll cover you.\nPETER: (amid the gun battle) Walter! Hey, Walter, stay here.\nWALTER: (palming the device) They'll need this to close the portal, to prevent him from going over.\nPETER: Give it to me. I'll do it. Give it to me!\nWALTER: Okay. It's simple, a child could do it. You just twist this.\nDAVID JONES: What's the status?\nJONES AIDE: Coordinates are coming into place, sir. We're almost there, sir.\nOLIVIA: Jones? (she shoots his gunman) Don't move.\nJONES AIDE: Manifold is stable.\nOLIVIA: I said don't move. (she shoots Jones' technician when he completes the link. Jones heads to the event horizon) Stop! Don't move.\nDAVID JONES: Beautiful, isn't it? (he hesitates) You'll understand if this reunion is brief.\nOLIVIA: If you take one more step, I'll shoot.\nDAVID JONES: (marching into the anomaly) Good-bye, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Don't! (she shoots him once. barely phased, he rises and continues. she shoots again)\nDAVID JONES: (not as injured as he should be from his gunshot wounds he turns and addresses Olivia) The teleporter, it may be killing me, but in the meantime, it's made me something rather special. You see, your bullets just go right through me. And soon Doctor Bell will see just how special I am.\nOLIVIA: Stop!\nPETER: (running in from the woods with the device) Dunham! (he activates the device just as Jones attempts to pass through it. the passage fails and a third of Jones skull evaporates along with the upper left quadrant of his torso)\nBROYLES: (walks in as she is repacking files) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nBROYLES: Under normal circumstances, I would ask you when I could expect your report. But in this case, I find myself at a bit of a loss.\nOLIVIA: How is Nina?\nBROYLES: She's doing fine. She wanted me to convey her gratitude. (he hesitates to continue)\nOLIVIA: What?\nBROYLES: We've been told to cease and desist our investigation into William Bell.\nOLIVIA: By whom?\nBROYLES: The kind of people that when they give you an order, you don't question it. I'm sorry.\nASTRID: (returning with groceries) Doctor Bishop... Good news. I got you some Berry Boom.\nPETER: (tail-gating Astrid into an inner office) Hey, what's wrong? (as they both eye an envelope with Peter's name on it. he opens the envelope and reads a letter from Walter)\nWALTER: (handwritten on paper) \"I'm stepping out for a bit. Don't worry about me, son. I know where I'm going.\"\nASTRID: You want me to call the police?\nPETER: No. That is the first time he has ever written a note. I think our little boy is growing up.\n(Walter stands in a graveyard and places a coin on the headstone of a Peter Bishop, 1978 - 1985)\nOLIVIA: (sitting silently and reflecting on her badge and gun, her cell phone rings) Hello?\nNINA: Agent Dunham, it's Nina Sharp. You held up your end of the bargain. Now, I'd like to hold up mine. Would you mind coming to Manhattan tomorrow?\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nNINA: Do you know the Mutsumi Hotel on Broadway?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nNINA: Great. Tomorrow it is, then. I hope you understand why I can't go through channels. And I appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this either. (Nina's instructions continue as Olivia drives southbound the next day for a rendezvous) I don't mean to sound overly cautious, but I think you'll soon understand why we'll want to keep this between us. Let's say one o'clock. Come alone. I'll answer any questions you have.\nOLIVIA: (sitting alone in an upstairs restaurant she refuses a beverage refill after her meeting failed to occur as scheduled) No, thank you. (after many patrons have left, she calls to check on her appointment) Nina Sharp? (listens) Olivia Dunham. (listens) No, I don't want to leave a message. She's expecting my call. (listens) What do you mean she's out of the country?\n(after entering the elevator to leave, somewhere between the fourteenth and twelfth floor, she starts to have visions of a crowded elevator. the power surges, the visions stop and she exits to meet a business woman)\nBUSINESS WOMAN: (approaches the elevator to greet Olivia and escort her down the hall) Agent Dunham, welcome. Right this way. Go right in. (opens an office door)\n(Olivia enters and looks around. she is joined a minute later)\nWILLIAM BELL: (in the shadows) I've been waiting quite a long time for this.\nOLIVIA: Where am I? Who are you?\nWILLIAM BELL: The answer to your first question is -- is very complicated. The answer to your second... (steps into the light) I'm William Bell.\n(Olivia turns and walks to a window. she is over ninety stories up in the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City)"

(politely to Parr in the hallway)\nLLOYD PARR: Are you okay?\n(Reed then abducts, and kills tenant Lloyd Parr... stealing his physical features in the process. Agents gather at the accident scene)\nFBI AGENT: (standing between the vehicles) It's car v. car. NYPD's taking witness statements now.\nAMY JESSUP: What the hell happened to the drivers?\nFBI AGENT: Hey. You caught the case.\nAMY JESSUP: So who's our man? Who was driving this vehicle? (the agent hands her the classified cover page from Olivia's personnel file)\nPETER: Walter. Come on. I don't need you to make me anything.\nWALTER: (pushing his cart along the aisles) I insist. You know, there's something you don't know about me, son.\nPETER: What's that? That once you enter a grocery store, you never leave again? Ever?\nWALTER: No. Before I ever became Chair of Bio-Chemistry at Harvard, which was after Oxford and M.I.T., I was sous-chef at the Bakersfield Food Lab.\nPETER: Sous-chef?\nWALTER: Um-huh. Well, technically I worked under Seymour Brodien.\nPETER: Am I supposed to know who that is?\nWALTER: He invented the Ho Ho!\nPETER: (smiling) Of course he did... Walter. I want to leave this place. And I don't need you to make me a cake.\nWALTER: I'm not making you a cake... I'm making you a custard. It's my specialty.\nPETER: I don't like custard. In fact, I've never liked custard.\nWALTER: As a boy, you loved it. You've just forgotten. Friday is your birthday. You deserve something wonderful.\nPETER: Well, for my birthday, can I have 'getting the hell out of here'?\nWALTER: We need to celebrate... and make sure Agent Dunham can attend. I want to see her face when she eats my pudding.\nPETER: That's disturbing. (answers his ringing cell-phone) Peter Bishop. (listens) What?\nAMY JESSUP: (greeting him after his screeching arrival) Mister Bishop?\nPETER: Yeah.\nAMY JESSUP: Agent Jessup. Hi.\nPETER: Hi. (points) This is my father. Walter.\nAMY JESSUP: Yeah. I have a couple of questions for you.\nPETER: How bad is she?\nAMY JESSUP: We don't know.\nPETER: Excuse me? How do you not know?\nAMY JESSUP: Can you explain exactly what you do? You're some sort of special consultant...\nPETER: Where's Charlie?\nAMY JESSUP: I'm sorry, Charlie who?\nPETER: Agent Charlie Francis. Where is he?\nAMY JESSUP: I believe he's en route from Quantico. I'm the Agent-in-Charge.\nPETER: Well Agent-in-Charge... where is Olivia Dunham?\n(unnoticed, Walter fiddles with the locked door on Olivia's SUV and gains access)\nAMY JESSUP: Witnesses report that after the crash, a man was seen leaving the car on foot... but no one saw anyone leave the SUV. The doors are still locked, the seatbelts still buckled, the airbags deployed... but there's no identation - which implies no one was behind the wheel at the moment of impact.\nPETER: Did you check to make sure the skid marks match the other vehicle?\nAMY JESSUP: Look, you still haven't told me what it is you do. You, Agent Dunham, your father. I checked with the Field Office. They said that all of you work is...\nPETER: ...classified. And that you don't have access. I don't have time for this.\nAMY JESSUP: It's not that I don't appreciate petulance, Mister Bishop... (Walter activates switches in the car and gets strange feedback and sounds) ... but the sooner you cooperate...\nPETER: ... I would love to cooperate as soon as you can find me an agent that can actually help me!\n(fearful, Walter exits the empty SUV, slamming the door and activating the alarm, everyone turns and stares as the horn blares and the engine races for a few seconds. then, after a few seconds of silence, Olivia shoots out of the vehicle through the windshield and tumbles to a stop, well in front of the SUV... and morbidly still)\nPARAMEDIC #1: (rushing a gurney full of Olivia through the corridor to emergency services. The Bishops wait - concerned) Female - unconscious - dislocated right hip. Possible brain herniation. BP's jumping - 180 over 20. Pupils are non-reactive.\nPARAMEDIC #2: Coding!\nER DOCTOR: Prep her - stat!\nBROYLES: (waiting on the front steps) Amy Jessup? Special Agent Broyles. We need to talk about what happened at that crime scene.\nAMY JESSUP: Sir --\nBROYLES: What happened, Junior Agent, is alright here in your report. (hands her the report) A random traffic accident involving a Federal Agent. No extenuating circumstances, case closed. Sign it, please.\nAMY JESSUP: But this girl --\nBROYLES: Sign the report, Agent. That's an order. (hands her a pen)\n(in the waiting area, Walter fiddles with a vending machine as Olivia's surgeon approaches)\nPETER: Walter.\nSURGEON: I'm afraid your friend's injuries were too severe.\nPETER: Oh, come on.\nSURGEON: We were unable to restore any brain function. Patients who suffer this kind of head trauma simply don't regain consciousness.\nWALTER: (dismissive, to the surgeon) Simple. Reductive. Absurd. (hopeful, to Peter) Life and death, these are relative terms. Contextually defined, dependent on cultural specifics.\nPETER: Walter --\nWALTER: (about the surgeon) He is undoubtedly indulging in primitive diagnostics. Agent Dunham is not dead. She's not dead. She's not dead.\nPETER: Walter -- she's not. Walter. Walter, wait, stop. (as he follows his father to Olivia)\nSURGEON: You can't go back there. Doctor, please. Back off.\nWALTER: (after inspecting her medical state) I'm so sorry, Olivia. (sniffles)\nBROYLES: (startling Peter from behind as he approaches the counter) Mind if I join you?\nPETER: I'm guessing you don't drink.\nBROYLES: (to the barkeep) Double.\nPETER: How did you find me?\nBROYLES: I work for the F.B.I. Where's your father?\nPETER: My father is off in la-la land. Mixed himself up a really nice cocktail of Valium, Haldol, Seconal, and I think Lorazepam. Astrid is baby-sitting.\nBROYLES: I've been called to Washington tomorrow. The efficacy of the Division is being questioned. I've been informed that our failure to deliver any useable results is unacceptable.\nPETER: They're shutting you down? (snickers in disbelief) What were we even doing, anyway? We'd sit around and wait for somebody to die some grisly, macabre death, or for the entire fabric of the universe to come shredding apart. We were the clean-up crew, sent in to mop it up and make sure it was all neat and tidy for the file. We were always too late anyway.\nBROYLES: That's not entirely true.\nPETER: We were too late for Olivia.\nBROYLES: (raises his glass) To Agent Dunham.\nPETER: To Agent Dunham. (raises his glass and clinks it to Broyles' glass)\nPETER: (after parking and entering, he finds a sad friend in a dark hallway) Hey, Rach. When did you get back?\nRACHEL: A few hours ago. Ella's at a friend's house. I didn't want her to remember her aunt like this. She had a living will. No 'life support'. They're gonna do this in... in the morning, so I've just been sitting with her, and... do you wanna...?\nPETER: Yeah.\nRACHEL: You know she liked you, Peter. Did you know that?\nPETER: (sighs, exhales, wanders into Olivia's room, sits on the side of her bed) Hey. (breathes deeply) Goodbye, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: (eyes wide open, trance-like) Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy. (screams and bolts forward)\nSURGEON: Can you tell me your name?\nOLIVIA: It's Olivia Dunham.\nSURGEON: Do you know the year?\nOLIVIA: Why am I in a hospital and what is wrong with my leg?\nRACHEL: You were in an accident. Do you remember? In New York?\nOLIVIA: Is Peter here? I need to see him.\nRACHEL: He's here, he's here. (as Peter enters the room)\nOLIVIA: I - I went somewhere.\nPETER: I know, you went to New York.\nOLIVIA: No. Yeah, but no.\nPETER: Olivia, look, you were in an accident.\nOLIVIA: No, no, I was trying to get somewhere and someone was trying to stop me, but I went there anyway, and -- (aural beeps from her monitoring equipment increase) Oh, God, what is happening?\nSURGEON: Mister Bishop, please, she needs to stay calm.\nOLIVIA: He told me something.\nPETER: Who?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I can't remember. But, oh, it was very important. There's something that I have to do.\nPETER: Who, Olivia? Who told you to do what?\nOLIVIA: I don't know, but there's something that I have to do, and I...\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: I think that our lives may depend on it.\nPETER: Whose lives?\nOLIVIA: Everyone's.\nSURGEON: (to nurse) Get that beta blocker and get her pulse down.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I need my gun. Please, I'm not safe. Somebody hurt me they did this to me. Please, Peter, my gun. I need my gun. Please, Peter.\nPETER: (just arriving in the lobby) Excuse me. I need to speak with Special Agent Broyles.\nRECEPTIONIST: Agent Broyles is in Washington.\nPETER: Uh, then Agent Francis, please, Charlie Francis.\nRECEPTIONIST: Sir, what is this regarding?\nPETER: I work for you guys. I'm a consultant. I need access to a file on a car accident yesterday in New York City.\nRECEPTIONIST: (inspects his badge and compares it to a computer record) I'm sorry. These credentials have been revoked, Mister Bishop. (run his I.D. thru a shredder)\nPETER: What? Look, lady, you need to help me.\nRECEPTIONIST: Please feel free to file a civilian request on our website.\nPETER: Web -- no, listen to me. One of your agents is in the hospital, and her life-- and possibly yours, depends on the work that I need to do, you find me somebody who can help me.\nESCORT: Okay, sir, if you'd exit the building -- (scuffles with Bishop briefly)\nAMY JESSUP: (to his rescue) I'll take him.\nPETER: (to the escort) I'm with her.\nPETER: What're you doing in Boston?\nAMY JESSUP: You like to fight, Mister Bishop? All that time in Iraq. Mob connections. You've got quite a combative history.\nPETER: You said you were gonna help me get my hands on that file.\nAMY JESSUP: It's on the seat behind you.\nPETER: What? (reaches back, retrieves the folder and starts to read the contents)\nAMY JESSUP: Something wasn't adding up about those skid marks. They were darkest at the back, not the front.\nPETER: So maximum torque farthest away from the incident. That means the driver wasn't slowing down.\nAMY JESSUP: He was speeding up.\nPETER: Then he must've been waiting.\nAMY JESSUP: Those are pictures from the surveillance camera in the parking structure adjacent to the accident site. George Reed. 524 Littlefield Road. Here in Lexington. We're fifteen minutes away. Alright, now it's your turn. What's the Fringe Division? What do you people do?\nPETER: (somber) Nothing. Not anymore.\nAMY JESSUP: (kicking open the front door) F.B.I. -- George Reed? Mister Reed? (entering a front room) Body. (kneels to inspect the corpse) Look at his lividity. If this guy was driving a car in New York, it wasn't yesterday.\nPETER: I need to get a ride for someone.\nWALTER: (later, with forensics and investigators in the room) Feel his anus. It's soaking wet. Expansion of the oral mucosa, the eyes, and the rectum to accommodate rapid fluid loss. If it's a virus, it obviously doesn't affect birds... (eyes a nearby bird cage) ...or people, at least not quickly. Agent, I need this body taken back to my lab.\nFORENSICS: Hey, lunatic, this body's going to the morgue. (to Amy) Is he crazy?\nWALTER: (seeking intervention) Peter?\nFORENSICS: Who is the Agent-in-Charge here?\nAMY JESSUP: I am. Take it wherever he wants.\nWALTER: Lovely.\nAMY JESSUP: Is he crazy?\nPETER: (under his breath) Oh yeah.\nAMY JESSUP: Whatever Fringe Division is or was, F.B.I. says it's been shut down. And yet I just sent you a body.\nPETER: Which does begs the question, why are you doing this?\nAMY JESSUP: Just following the case.\nPETER: It doesn'pay to bluff a bluffer, Agent Jessup. You know, a lot of people would be scared by this. Most, actually.\nAMY JESSUP: There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt--\nPETER: Oh wow. Really? Butchered Shakespeare.\nWALTER: (coming from the house to get permission) Peter. Peter! They said I can ride in the back with the body. Can I?\nPETER: Sure. Of course you can. Stay out of the medications, though. Please.\nAMY JESSUP: I think I've been waiting for you people my whole life.\n(the door bells jingle as mock Lloyd Parr enters a businees with many old business machines on display)\nSTORE OWNER: I'll be with you in just a minute. So what can I do you for?\nLLOYD PARR: I'm looking for a Selectric. Selectric 251.\nSTORE OWNER: Doesn't exist. They never made one. It's 245 straight to 255.\nLLOYD PARR: No, no, no. I'm still gonna need the 251.\nSTORE OWNER: Ah. You're one of them. You know, it's been six years. I just kind of figured that, uh... (opens cash register, removes key and hands it over) Straight back. Last door. Hey. You -- you tell 'em. I'm not waiting around forever. (mumbles to himself as Parr walks to the back room) I am not waiting around forever.\n(Parr sits at the table with the typewriter he requested and places a sheet of paper in it. He types that he was successful with his mission and requests to be extracted. He looks at the mirror next to the table as the reflected image of the typewriter activates without a user)\n(On the sheet of paper in the typewriter before him, he sees a that he was not successful and he receives new mission orders)\nAMY JESSUP: (as they prepare to enter the Kresge Building) What are we doing here?\nPETER: (walking the halls) As I'm sure you're probably already aware, my father was a scientist, who was sent to St. Claire's. A mental institution, yes, but there is more. Worse. And some good, too. It's complicated. But for right now all you really need to know is that this building is where he used to work. He was working here as a professor. Simultaneously, he was working on a number of top-secret government projects. We do our thing down here in the lab because, according to him, It's the only place that he can work. (as the reach the lab door) You're coming up on your last chance to turn back.\nAMY JESSUP: Are you kidding?\nPETER: Agent Jessup, welcome to Fringe Division. Astrid, Amy. Amy, Astrid. Nice haircut.\nASTRID: Thanks. Hi.\nAMY: Hello.\nWALTER: Oh, hello again. I need four bunsen burners, eight metal bowls yea big, and a freezer.\nASTRID: The bowls need to be sterilized?\nWALTER: It's not for the autopsy. It's for the custard. For Peter's birthday.\nPETER: Walter, will you forget about the custard?\nWALTER: I refuse. Also - rib cutters, toothed forceps, and a bone saw - for the autopsy. Not for the groceries.\n(Gene moos)\nCHARLIE: (sitting nearby) I got here as fast as I could.\nOLIVIA: I'm alright. You didn't have to come all this way.\nCHARLIE: You're not alright.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, I'm fine\nCHARLIE: My second year with Brooklyn P.D., one night we get a domestic disturbance call. Partner and I go over to his house. I'm with the guy, right? And he's, uh... saying it's nothing, you know, just a little argument. My partner calls from the other room and says that we need an ambulance for the girl. And I just know the guy beat the crap out of his girlfriend, so I go for my gun, I get him on the ground, and I'm cuffing him. And I hear a gunshot from the other room. I turn around, and this, uh, bloody girl-- brutalized, brutalized girl-- is, um... aiming a gun at me. What I didn't know at the time was she had just killed my partner. She fires. Hits me in my chest. (stands-up and walks closer) Anyway, um... I'm in I.C.U. for six days. You know, and, um, hospital for two weeks. Kept on telling my wife, 'I'm fine'. I was shaken, and I was scared. Now, if you're like me, you got a gun underneath your pillow... Peter called me. (smiles) Hey. You can fool the doctors, kiddo. You can't fool me.\nOLIVIA: I don't know what happened to me. I'm so scared. I can't even load it. My hands won't stop shaking. Charlie, I can't. I can't even load it.\nCHARLIE: Hey. You're gonna be alright. It'll be alright.\nWALTER: It's a shame. These lungs were in excellent condition once. Is the half-and-half boiling?\nASTRID: Yeah, just about.\nWALTER: Mix the eggs, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl. Please.\nPETER: Walter, there's nothing wrong with the blood sample.... What are you thinking?\nWALTER: (giggling) It's funny. I love custard, but I hate flan. Which could be an issue of semantics, or difficulty with the French. Which I doubt, given my near obsession with moules a la creme Normande.\nPETER: Well, that's fascinating, but what I actually meant was are there any theories about how this man died?\nWALTER: No, the water expulsion, though dramatic and messy, seems to be a symptom of some other process. But I stumbled upon something that did the unthinkable. Look inside the mouth. (to Amy) You can come closer, dear. Look at the soft palate. What do you see?\nPETER: There are three markings. Indents like stab wounds. What are they? And while we're at, what do you mean you stumbled across something that does the unthinkable?\nWALTER: It made me remember something.\nAMY JESSUP: (to Peter, as Walter loads a VCR tape) Is this you?\nPETER: Yeah. My father recently took a little trip down Memory Lane, and for no reason has become Wildly obsessed with my childhood. He also likes to check and make sure that I'm still breathing when he thinks that I'm asleep, which is a little creepy.\nWALTER: Focus, please. This is an experiment that Belly and I did. We came up with such a spectacular blend of drugs. One day, Leary came by, and he said, \"you're kidding me.\"\nASTRID: Is this gonna make her head explode or something?\nWALTER: Well, in a sense, yes, but not physically. We're trying to augment Her fifth, sixth, and seventh chakras.\nASTRID: Throat, Third eye, and Crown.\nWALTER: That is correct, Asterix.\nASTRID: Astrid.\nWALTER: Communication, speech, clairaudience, cognition, and thought. Spirituality\nPETER: You wanted her to see god.\nWALTER: (heard on video) who is he?\nREBECCA: (seen on video) The man with the machine. The three-- the three nails. The three nails go in the mouth. There. He is a soldier. From somewhere else. He's.. he's from a place that looks like this, but it's not here. Oh, he's... he's from another universe, man. Oh, I can see him. He pushes up the machine.\nWALTER: (heard on video) He pushes up the machine?\nREBECCA: Oh, yes, in the mouth. And then he changes. That's how they change. They're like shape shifters. That's how they hide. They can look like us. They can look like any of us.\nPETER: Astrid. (heading for her computer station) I need you to log on to the joint law enforcement database. We need to be informed immediately of any corpse that matches that description.\nREBECCA: They can look like any of us.\n(still in bed, she attempts to load bullets into the magazine for her service pistol. shaking and angry, she is unable and fumbles the rounds into her lap)\nSENATOR: Unsubstantited claims of invasion. Reports of technology run amok. The old \"X\" designation and your fringe investigations have been indulgences in the federal budget for over half a century. Well, the salad days are over, Mister Broyles.\nBROYLES: Colonel.\nSENATOR: Excuse me?\nBROYLES: ...or Special Agent, as you'd prefer, Senator.\nNEIL SCHELL: Colonel Broyles. Now look, listen, we all have a job here, and we--\nBROYLES: Yes, Senator, I have a job. The same job I have had in three administrations and six wars. To defend our national security. And I assure you we are not secure. Yes, sometimes a threat is familiar. But I have come to learn that sometimes it is far worse -- and when it is worse, when the threat is unimaginable, that is when we are at the door. And you should thank God for that.\nNEIL SCHELL: (calmly) Phillip, without something usable, something to support the human and fiscal cost... I - I'm sorry.\nNINA: If your appearance is any indication... now I don't have to tell you how important it is that Fringe Division not be shut down.\nBROYLES: I'm not the one who needs convincing.\nNINA: But we've tried. I'm afraid that this one is out of our hands. (she steps up to him and kisses him on the lips) Do what you always used to do, Phillip. Save the day.\nMORGUE ATTENDANT: Feds?\nPETER: Yeah, that's us. Well, her, technically, but say us.\nAMY JESSUP: Where's the body that triggered the alert? The one that has the three holes in its mouth?\nLAB TECH: It's right over there. (points across the room to an examining table)\nAMY JESSUP: Thank you. (approaches the corpse of the authentic Lloyd Parr and reads from a file) They found this guy two blocks from the accident site.\nPETER: The shape shifters must leave the original body behind.\nAMY JESSUP: Do you remember the girl from the video? That she said he was a soldier? My father was a soldier. They do one thing, life or death.\nPETER: They stay on mission. These killings weren't random.\nAMY JESSUP: Which means this man, this thing, whatever it is, its still trying to accomplish its goal.\nPETER: (worried) Olivia. (hurrying toward the exit)\n(mock Lloyd Parr stands outside the hospital with the transfer device in hand. later he stands quietly in a loading dock area as a nurse gets some sun and sips a beverage. she turns and is startled by his presence)\nNURSE: Oh, my god. You scared me to death. - - - - AMY JESSUP: (in her vehicle, on the phone, racing to the hospital. Peter rides along silently) We've sent his description to hospital security... to dispatch all available agents. If he's there, we'll get him. - - - - (mock) NURSE: (entering Olivia's room and aprroaching her. You're looking better.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. I'm starting to feel a little bit more like me.\nNURSE: So how's your memory?\nOLIVIA: Still all just fragments. I remember going to New York, I remember driving, but I can't seem to see anything past that.\nNURSE: It happens with head injuries. People can lose days before an accident. The best thing to do is just to keep trying, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: I was on my way somewhere to meet with someone, and -- I guess someone hit my car. But--\nNURSE: But... ?\nOLIVIA: It doesn't make any sense.\nNURSE: Mm-hmm.\nOLIVIA: It's as if I went somewhere and talked to someone. And then... came back to the accident.\nNURSE: Do you remember who you were going to meet with?\nOLIVIA: No... Almost. He told me something.\nNURSE: What? Go on.\nOLIVIA: I can't, uh--\nNURSE: Try.\nOLIVIA: Something's hidden.\nNURSE: Yes. Where?\nOLIVIA: I - I can't--\nNURSE: Where is it hidden?\nOLIVIA: I can't remember.\nNURSE: That's really all you know then, isn't it?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nNURSE: Okay. (hesitates, then jumps on top of Olivia, appearing to want to kill her)\nCHARLIE: (rushing in to Hospital from the parking area) They have surveillance of your suspect entering the lobby.\nPETER: Olivia's room?\nCHARLIE: The floor's locked up six ways from Sunday. The only person allowed in is the nurse.\nNURSE: (continuing to battle physically with Olivia) Don't fight it. It's over.\n(Jessup barges in and fires a round into the nurse. Unphased, the shape shifter, leaps clear of Olivia out of the nearby window landing three stories below on a sill, then effortlesly jumping three more stories to ground level)\nAMY JESSUP: (from Olivia's window) Agent Francis, suspect is now white female, black hair, scrubs, gray sweater. She jumped down to the loading dock, she's heading into the basement.\nPETER: (entering the room. to Olivia) You okay?\nOLIVIA: Go get that bitch.\n(in the dark, damp basement, Amy and Charlie search the corridors separately... pistols drawn. Peter joins the search unarmed. Charlie approaches the roaring furnace, failing to notice the mock-Nurse hiding in the overhead pipes and wiring. As he passes, the assassin drops to the ground. Charlie fires twice - with unknown effect)\nPETER: (running toward the gunfire, he runs into Amy, and her drawn weapon) Whoa, whoa, whoa. (hoping not to be shot)\nPETER: (approaching Agent Francis and the downed nurse) Charlie! Hey! You okay? You hit?\nCHARLIE: (stoic and panting) I'm good.\n(Peter examines the nurse and retrieves the device from her side)\n(Peter knocks on her door and enters with a large bouquet)\nOLIVIA: So who was she?\nPETER: Walter thinks that she was a shape-changing soldier from another universe. He thinks that might be where you went. Hmm. Do you think it's a bad sign that I can say that out loud and neither one of us thinks I'm crazy?\nOLIVIA: (laughs) She thought I knew where something was hidden.\nPETER: No matter what happened to you, and no matter where you went, Walter will figure it out. Olivia, I need to ask you something. (sits on the edge of her bed)\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nPETER: Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy. You said that to me just after you woke up. Do you remember it?\nOLIVIA: No. Latin?\nPETER: Mm-mm. Greek. My mother used to say that to me every night before I went to bed.\nOLIVIA: (laughs) There really isn't a point where things just can't get weirder, is there? What does it mean?\nPETER: It means 'be a better man than your father'. Walter was already gone. It was like a code between my mother and me. It meant keep your people close. Take care of the people you care about.\nOLIVIA: Well you're good at that. (sighs)\nPETER: It's good to see you again, Olivia Dunham.\nOLIVIA: It's good to see you too.\nNURSE: (knocks on door. from the hallway) It's time to check your vitals.\nPETER: You should get some rest. (starts to walk out of the room)\nOLIVIA: Peter. Is it true that they're shutting us down?\nPETER: (confidently) No.\nPETER: (approaching as Broyles starts up the steps) Agent Broyles.\nBROYLES: Mister Bishop.\nPETER: At the bar, you said they needed to see results.\nBROYLES: Yeah.\nPETER: Walter says this tech isn't from here. And that it's broken. But it is proof and if they can fix it, they can have an army who can look like anyone they want them to. You tell them you can get this tech, and they can have it, but they are not shutting us down. From now on, we're calling the shots. We're done reacting. We're not gonna be too late anymore. (handing over the shape changing device) After all, somebody's got to save their asses, right?\nBROYLES: You surprise me Mister Bishop.\nPETER: Thanks. (as Broyles heads inside)\n(in comfortable clothing at her computer station, Amy types away. the charred corpse of the genetically transformed man from the Vertusair crash is on the monitor. on the right side of the monitor, notation of Fringe Divison cases have brief descriptions and biblical cross references. on her left side, she closes the bible she has been matching the references too)\n(Peter enters the darkened lab and pauses. Gene moos as the lights are turned on for a small surprise party)\nWALTER\/ASTRID: Happy birthday, Peter!\nWALTER: Look. Custard.\nASTRID: Happy birthday, Peter.\n(Peter chuckles and accepts a hug from his father)\n(Charlie Francis removes laundry bags from a laundry cart, revealing the body of --- Charlie Francis --- he then lifts the nude corpse and throws it into the large furnace)"

Don't forget -- Lansdale High plays Hatfield tonight. This cross-town rivalry should make for a great game. Come on out and support the team. In fact, we've got four pairs of tickets to give away to the first four callers who can tell me the name of Hatfield's starting quarterback. The lines are open now, so now's your chance.\nCO-WORKER: Oh, come on.\nRAYMOND: Forgot my gear.\nCO-WORKER: Hurry, I don't want to miss kickoff.\nRADIO: (faintly) If you see anything or anyone suspicious, please contact Sheriff Golightly's office. All calls are anonymous. Well, that's it for me. Cheryl Clark is up next to keep you company on the way home. (easy listening music plays)\nCO-WORKER: Let's go, Raymond. What's the holdup?\nRAYMOND: (approaches his equipment) Just a second. (becomes distracted with the cornfield, the scarecrow and - a crow)\n(with easy listening Rick Nelson music wafting around, Raymond heads out of the staging area and deeper into the cornfield. noticing a dark blue anomaly just at the surface, he reaches down to touch it. the anomaly - a hand - reaches up and grabs him, dragging him underground)\nCREATURE: Raah! (the crow caws and a train whistles by)\nCO-WORKER: Raymond! Raymond! (searching without success)\nNURSE: There you go. (cuts off her I.D. bracelet)\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nNURSE: You take care, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: I will.\nPETER: Let me get that.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I'm fine.\nPETER: I know you are.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: (picks-up her cane and inspects it) Well... just looking for the hidden ninja sword.\nOLIVIA: (laughs) Well, that one wasn't covered by insurance. Thank you.\nPETER: Did you check the drawers?\nOLIVIA: No. Anything I've forgotten, they can keep. I don't want to spend another minute here. I'm, uh, no good at sitting around.\nPETER: You're also no good at letting people help you.\nOLIVIA: Oh, I'll let you carry my suitcase.\n(as they exit the hospital and load into the car, Charlie sits and watches from nearby)\n(laying on the ground, legs covered in a dark blue slime, Raymond's legs seem paralyzed. he ignites his lighter to see where he is. he crawls on his stomach down the tunnel and encounters rotting corpses. a naked, man-like creature approaches on all fours. unable to crawl away fast enough, Raymond is dragged screaming... back into the cave.\nPETER: Did you get me everything on my list?\nBROYLES: The F.B.I. signed off on everything you asked for, including new housing for you and your father. But the C-130 transport plane is proving a bit tough to requisition.\nPETER: We're not gonna need it for this one. (hands him a sheet of paper\nBROYLES: Pennsylvania?\nPETER: I was trolling the F.B.I. databases, looking for any cases that were similar to Olivia's -- sudden disappearances. This town has had six missing people in the last two months, four of which eyewitnesses say just disappeared into thin air. Thought it was worth checking out.\nBROYLES: How is she?\nPETER: Olivia? She'll be fine.\nBROYLES: Do it. And keep a close eye on Dunham.\nASTRID: Alright, Walter, the cameras are ready.\nWALTER: Here we go. Uh-huh - Agent Dunham, you're just in time.\nOLIVIA: Just in time for what?\nASTRID: We're re-creating your car accident.\nWALTER: Okay, Astrid, ready?\nASTRID: 3...2...1.\nWALTER: (releasing a counterweight, a toy car with frog onboard races across the table and through the air. four flashes illuminate the trip. the frog lands in a net - ribbet!) The photographs, quickly.\nASTRID: I know, Walter.\nWALTER: Y-your accident -- I'm -- I'm testing a theory.\nOLIVIA: Oh.\nWALTER: (to Astrid when she hands the photos to him) Thank you. (to Olivia) Excuse me. Uh... no matter what I try, I can't make the frog disappear.\nASTRID: We've been at this for five hours.\nWALTER: Science is patience.\nASTRID: It's also slimy.\nWALTER: From all the evidence, you were missing from your car for at least an hour before you came crashing back through the windshield. You simply disappeared.\nASTRID: He thinks you traveled to another universe.\nWALTER: (preparing a chalk-talk to support his theory) You see, Agent Dunham, we assume that our universe is the only universe. But that's not true. There is an infinite number of universes. And in each of them, there is a version of us -- you, me, and Agent Farnsworth -- but each one slightly different... changed over time based on the accumulation of our choices. So... In this reality --\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: We've had this conversation before, haven't we?\nOLIVIA: I know that I went somewhere. I think I met with someone. But the rest is like a dream that I... I just can't quite remember.\nWALTER: Perhaps you will... in time. When they said you were dead... when I saw you lying there... (deeply saddened) I don't know what I would have done.\nOLIVIA: (fondly) Walter...\nWALTER: But you're here now, and apart from the obvious, you appear to be fine.\nOLIVIA: I appear to be?\nWALTER: No. Traveling to an alternate reality has its consequences. No. No, you'll be fine.\nPETER: Hey. You feel up to going for a drive?\n(the science team drives through the cornfields to the location of the missing construction worker)\nWALTER: (exiting the vehicle and eagerly greeting everyone in earshot) Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm Walter Bishop. Hello.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Sheriff Golightly? Special Agent Olivia Dunham... and this is Peter and Walter Bishop.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: (approaching the newcomers) Don't remember calling the F.B.I.\nOLIVIA: Well, your office has filed six missing-persons reports.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Seven now.\nPETER: Seven. All under the same circumstances?\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Same as the others. Just disappear. Be damned if I know what to make of it.\nWALTER: (philosphically) Well, we're all victims of our own gene pool. Someone must have peed in yours. (getting the Sheriff's attention)\nPETER: I - I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse my father.\nWALTER: Yes. Excuse me.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: No -- (stops Walter from entering the crime scene)\nOLIVIA: Sheriff. These two men are both Special Investigators with the F.B.I.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: ...and when the good men and women who have come here from three separate counties have finished collecting evidence, then you can see it. (approaches a forensics tech that has bagged evidence) Let me see what you got.\nWALTER: May I? (receives the bag from the Sheriff) Wonderful!\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Have you run across something like this before?\nWALTER: (eagerly) Absolutely not. The air here is quite auspicious! (breathes deeply) Makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: The air?\nWALTER: This! (evidence bag) It's a fresh mystery, pregnant with possibilities. Who knows where it may lead? (giddy)\nPETER: (looking at the scarecrow) I bet you he knows.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Here are the investigation files. Everything we have so far from the first disappearance, which is not a hell of a lot. Possible suspect interviews, case leads, dead ends from the disappearances.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Agent Dunham... the F.B.I. has very specific laws that govern what their jurisdiction involves. None of these disappearances occurred on a military base. None of them happened across state lines.\nOLIVIA: You've already given us evidence to analyze.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: There's information in these files --\nOLIVIA: I understand. But I can get a special procedural order to --\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Why are you so interested in this case?\nOLIVIA: (loses train of thought when distracted by acute buzzing and traffic sounds) Excuse me?\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Why are you so interested in this case?\nOLIVIA: I, um... I - I'm sorry, I - I --\nPETER: (saving her from her distraction, he distracts the Sheriff) The Night Of Desirable Objects? I have one just like this. (handles the lure on the nearby file cabinet)\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: You know yourself a little bit about night fishing, do you?\nPETER: I've used hair jigs and pork rind, rubber jigs for largemouth. You ever try using spinnerbaits at night?\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Oh, yeah. You can use pork rind with those too, you know.\nPETER: Can you really?\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: Yeah. I like the topwater...\n(the science team leaves the Sheriff's office with a box of files as Olivia make a cell phone call)\nCHARLIE: (answering) Agent Francis.\nOLIVIA: Hey, it's me.\nCHARLIE: Hey.\nOLIVIA: I'm sending you a victim sheet from a multiple missing-persons case in Pennsylvania. Can you run the names and, um... and notify me if any red flags come up?\nCHARLIE: Sure. I just have to run an errand.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thanks, Charlie. Bye.\n(Charlie, in some physical distress, enters a dusty storefront with older office equipment on display)\nSTORE OWNER: I'll be with you in, uh -- in just a minute.\nCHARLIE: I need the back room. (curtly) Now. (takes the key to the back room, enters and begins to type on the Selectric 251)\nPETER: Well, this is wildly helpful. According to the Sheriff, the second person who disappeared -- His mom makes a mean apple pie.\nOLIVIA: In case you were wondering, Andre Hughes is partial to flannel. He likes to wear flannel shirts, except, of course, in the Summer.\nPETER: I'm gonna go get a soda. You want something?\nOLIVIA: No, thank you.\nWALTER: (thinking) Hmm.\nPETER: How's it going, Walter?\nWALTER: I plan to urinate in twenty-three minutes.\nPETER: Good to know.\nWALTER: I'm telling you because I'm going to need help unzipping my fly. I can't feel my hand. It seems the substance from Pennsylvania is a paralytic.\nPETER: Which means that whoever took those people paralyzed them first, so they couldn't fight back.\nWALTER: Interesting theory. Very devious.\nPETER: Do you think we can trace it, where it's from?\nWALTER: The base solution contains human D.N.A., male, I think. Of course, it's a mutation. Perhaps a whole new stage of human evolution. Wouldn't that be fantastic?\nPETER: If we've stumbled upon a mutant? No. Fantastic's not the first word that pops into my mind.\nWALTER: We're all mutants. What's more remarkable... is how many of us appear to be normal.\nPETER: (to Olivia) Find anything?\nOLIVIA: Hey, you remember Andre Hughes?\nPETER: Uh, yeah, Hughes. He was the flannel guy, right?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, well, he's a neighbor of the Shanes, and he was at their house when the Sheriff went to follow up on their son's disappearance. He was also at the Thomasons' just after Jennifer Thomason disappeared. Sheriff Golightly arrived just as Hughes was leaving.\nPETER: What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: I'm thinking you drive.\n(a train whistles as it motors past the field. in a large tunnel below, the corpse of Raymond is discovered)\nANDRE HUGHES: No! (puts down his lantern) Aw, hell.\n(overhead, Peter and Olivia drive down a dirt road to the Hughes farm. they knock on the front door)\nANDRE HUGHES: (approaching from behind) Aw, hell. Who are you?\nOLIVIA: Ah, Mister Hughes. Olivia Dunham, and this is Peter Bishop. (shows her badge) We're wanting to ask you a few questions.\nANDRE HUGHES: F.B.I. Oh.\nOLIVIA: uh... I assume you've heard about the people that have recently gone missing.\nANDRE HUGHES: Uh, yup. I know about it. I'd love to help if I can. Please... after you. (opens front door) Either of you have any experience with water wells? (entering the house)\nOLIVIA: No.\nANDRE HUGHES: No. Ah. This time of year I spend most of my time maintaining and... digging 'em out. I wouldn't wish it on either of you. Eh. It's like to drive me crazy. This is my fifth well in two months. Can't seem to find that switch button. I'm just gonna go in the other room... (Olivia's hearing becomes hyper-sensitive makes her think there is someone else in the house)...and wash this dirt off. Make yourself comfortable.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me. Is there someone else in this house?\nANDRE HUGHES: No.\nOLIVIA: (hears raspy breathing. quietly to Peter) There's someone else in this house. Did you hear that? Keep him busy. (she follows breathing noises upstairs and into a lab-like room. pistol drawn) Come out of there. (snarling noises continue from a closet. an empty closet. a creak in the hallway sets her off. she turns and fires once... just missing Peter's head) Oh! Peter! Oh, my god. Oh, Peter, oh, my god, I -I -- I'm so sorry! I thought I heard something. I thought I-- I thought I heard someone. (Peter stares at her - displeased)\nANDRE HUGHES: He fires a gun in my house, and now you're bringing me down here? I don't understand. You don't think I had anything to do with these missing people, do you?\nOLIVIA: Well, at the moment, Mister Hughes, we're just trying to gather information. So I understand that you're a doctor.\nANDRE HUGHES: Yes.\nOLIVIA: But you retired nearly twenty years ago.\nANDRE HUGHES: That's right.\nBROYLES: (entering the observation room) Anything?\nPETER: Not yet.\nOLIVIA: (over the intercom) What have you done since then?\nPETER: We scoured the house. There's no evidence that links him to the disappearances, just a bunch of old lab equipment. We had it packed up, sent over to Harvard. Walter's taking a look at it now.\nOLIVIA: (continues her interview) According to your records, in the wake of the disappearances, you visited with some of the victims' relatives. With, uh, Martin Shane's mother, and, uh... Jennifer Thomason's husband.\nANDRE HUGHES: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Were they former patients?\nANDRE HUGHES: No.\nOLIVIA: Just friends?\nANDRE HUGHES: I hardly knew either of them. But I thought I could help them. I... I thought I could comfort them. I lost my wife and my son seventeen years ago. She died giving birth to him. He was mine. For five minutes, I had a son. I could never hurt these people.\nOLIVIA: Mister Hughes, we'd like to take a sample of your blood. We'd like to compare it to some evidence that we found at the scene of the last disappearance. Do we, uh, have your permission to do that?\nANDRE HUGHES: Am I under arrest?\nOLIVIA: Not presently.\nANDRE HUGHES: Then, no. No. You don't have my permission.\nBROYLES: (to Peter, in the observation room) I'll get a warrant to take his blood. Have olivia hold him for twenty-four hours. It says in her report Dunham's gun went off?\nPETER: (chuckles) Yeah. Misfire.\nBROYLES: (leaving the room) I'll send Agent Jessup to the Hughes house.\nDOCTOR: (testing her vision for pupil reaction) Dizziness?\nOLIVIA: No.\nDOCTOR: How's your short-term memory?\nOLIVIA: Uh, what's your name?\nDOCTOR: (laughs) Good. You seem to be doing well. You can go ahead and get dressed.\nNINA: (entering the examination room) Hello, Agent Dunham. I haven't had a chance to visit since your accident, but Agent Broyles has been keeping me apprised. I was concerned.\nOLIVIA: Well, thanks. I - I'm doing okay.\nNINA: I'm glad to hear that... though sometimes the physical injury is the easiest to get over. I remember when I was first diagnosed with cancer. Beside the fear, my most overwhelming sensation was one of betrayal... the realization that my own body was fundamentally foreign to me, that it was a threat. You've been through quite an ordeal, Olivia -- one of many lately. To overlook it would be a mistake.\nOLIVIA: What's this? (takes a piece note paper from Nina)\nNINA: Sam Weiss, the man who helped put me back together.\nOLIVIA: You know, the F.B.I. has psychologists. If I thought that I needed --\nNINA: Well, he's not a psychologist. When you're ready, I believe he can help you.\n(forensics boxes up items and gathers them for removal. Amy strolls around and notices a religious figurine, then turns to see a armoire with a Christian cross on the panel of the door. inside is a bible and candles. she opens the book and discovers a newspaper clipping citing the cause of his wife and sons death as - unknown. behind the article is a handwritten note a Pastor citing the loss as - God's will)\nPETER: Okay. Thanks. (hangs up phone) That was Olivia -- Agent Jessup told her Hughes may have killed his wife and child seventeen years ago.\nWALTER: Oh, finally some good news. I assume we can dig them up. I haven't had any bodies to examine. Seven missing persons, no bodies.\nASTRID: Alright. I'll get an exhumation order.\n(as excavation and extraction of the coffins of Eveline and Baby Boy Hughes begins, Andre Hughes sits on the floor of the interrogation room, shoes removed, dismantling and bending wire from a rack, with his hands and teeth)\nPETER: If Hughes is hiding something, we're gonna find out what it is.\n(digging continues)\nPETER: Put his wife's coffin down here. Okay, let's open it up. (the top is flipped back to expose the decayed corpse. Andre Hughes continues to fashion a loop from the metal wiring)\nPETER: Let's open the baby boy's.\nOLIVIA: (the top is flipped back to expose an empty casket) Oh, my God.\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: There's no body. (notice a hole in the bottom) Looks like something dug its way in.\nOLIVIA: Or dug its way out. (the team walks to the excavated hole and sees a large hole at the bottom) I think we have some questions for Mister Hughes.\n(at the Federal Building, Hughes hangs lifeless from his makeshift noose)\n(with an escort, Olivia finds her way back to the interrogation room where Hughes was being held, only to enter the room to find him hanging by the metal noose he had fabricated)\nWALTER: That's curious.\nPETER: What? What's curious?\nWALTER: Mrs. Hughes has scarring to the joints, butterfly lesions to the face. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, a very advanced case.\nPETER: Lupus?\nASTRID: Which means what?\nWALTER: Notably, she was incapable of producing offspring.\nASTRID: Except she did. She had a baby boy.\nPETER: Yeah.\nWALTER: A baby boy? That's impossible. Lupus results in an overactive immune system. Her own body would have destroyed the fetus long before --\nPETER: Yes, and yet despite that, she was somehow able to give birth to a son, who, from all appearances, then burrowed his way out of his casket.\nWALTER: The grave of a boy... who was not in his grave.\n(the Sheriff works his way around the property, pounding in wooden stakes and attaching crime scene tape... when a large mound in the grass appears, then recedes, just out of his sight)\nOLIVIA: How the hell did this happen? Why wasn't anyone watching him?\nBROYLES: We're looking into it right now.\nOLIVIA: We need to have Andre Hughes' body taken back to Walter Bishop's lab as soon as possible.\nBROYLES: Already on its way.\n(Olivia's super-sensitive hearing kicks-in and she hears a cell phone conversation from the other end of the parking structure)\nALEX: Hey, Jim, it's Alex. I know I'm late. I'm leaving right now, okay? Yeah, I understand. I'll take care of it. I'll call him now. Thanks. [phone beeping]\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham? (calling her from her distraction as she hears sounds, and envisions images, from around the building) Agent Dunham?\nWALTER: (entering with a list of test results) Peter, I've got it. Mrs. Hughes' womb. You were right. She did give birth.\nPETER: I'm glad we got that settled.\nWALTER: The afterbirth is still inside her. Look. Look at the tissue composition.\nPETER: Walter. (reading a test result) According to this, Hughes' baby wasn't entirely human.\nWALTER: It explains his research -- reproductive biology and gene replacement. I hypothesize that he may have used some scorpion D.N.A. -- It's an incredibly resilient creature -- and also possibly something that lives underground, a - a mole rat.\nPETER: Scorpions do paralyze their prey with toxin. It could explain the blue liquid.\nASTRID: Hey, what did I miss?\nPETER: Hughes' baby -- he altered it inside the womb so that it could survive its mother's lupus.\nASTRID: Okay. That is sick.\nWALTER: That is brilliant! He's created a super-baby -- one capable of surviving in the most inhospitable environment. (Olivia hobbles into the meeting from an outer room) Oh, Agent Dunham. We've had a breakthrough.\nOLIVIA: I heard. Hughes' son. I think I might know where he is. When we were at the Hughes' house, I heard a noise, like something breathing. I thought that I had imagined it, but... I didn't. So if hughes' son is still alive, I think that he is somewhere in that house... or near that house.\nPETER: Or under it.\n(the Sheriff puts some equipment back in his cruiser and turns to walk towards the house. he stops when the soil in front of him starts to crack and divide)\nSHERIFF GOLIGHTLY: (as the crack begins to accelerate towards him) What the...? (as he falls to his dusty fate) Ahhh!\n(returning to Hughes' farmhouse, they knock, then enter thru the front door)\nOLIVIA: Hello. (looking for a response) Sheriff Golightly? (Peter detects a hidden door behind wallpapering and kicks it open to find an abandoned nursery. Olivia finds another unexplored room, draws her pistol and enters) Peter!\nPETER: Hey. (holds up small object from floor)\nOLIVIA: I think it's a canine tooth.\nPETER: (pulling loose brick from the wall he finds a skull) Ugh! Confirmed. Dog. (probing further, he sees a passageway behind the wall) Gonna grab a shovel.\nOLIVIA: (probing further alone, she observes corpses strewn in the dark tunnel) Peter?\nPETER: Yeah. (turning to answer)\nOLIVIA: (the creature appears behind her and bites her neck) AAH! OH! PETER! (as she is dragged into the tunnel) AAH!\nPETER: OLIVIA! (chasing after her)\nOLIVIA: OH! OH! (as she is pulled further away)\nPETER: OLIVIA!\nOLIVIA: Oh... oh. Ahh. oh.\nPETER: (as the creature bites his arm) AAH!\nOLIVIA: Ahh. (hands Peter a bone shard to stab the beast) Peter! (injured, the creature falls back and starts to tunnel out of the cavern. the roof of the structure fails and the Sheriff's cruiser fall from the surface... across the mid-section of the creature, apparently killing it)\n(as law enforcement agents pull metal traps from holes near the house, Olivia rides home)\nOLIVIA: He must have realized that was his son, because we found traps set in all of these holes he had dug\\ all over his property. Could you imagine living with a burden like that... when all you wanted was a son? (thinks) Charlie... what if I don't want to remember?\nCHARLIE: You mean your accident?\nOLIVIA: All of it -- where I went... who I met, what he told me. I mean, what if there is a part of my brain that's trying to protect me?\nCHARLIE: I'm just not sure you have much of a choice here, Olivia. If Walter was correct about you going to that other universe, then whatever secrets you learned might be worth remembering.\nOLIVIA: Another universe... (both half-smile) I never thought that I would ever hear you utter those words with a straight face. (giggles) You've come a long way, Charlie Francis.\nCHARLIE: Well, you know whatever it is... we'll deal with it together. I'll help you remember.\nOLIVIA: (solemnly) I know you will.\nWALTER: Are you going fishing, son?\nPETER: Yes. But not alone.\nWALTER: Oh, no. Who with?\nPETER: Well, once upon a time, there was a young man... probably around ten or eleven, who got it in his head that he wanted to take his father fishing. (preparing his tackle) So he saved-up all his money from his paper route and bought a very special lure. (displays the bait)\nWALTER: Oh.\nPETER: It's called the Night Of Desirable Objects. Sadly, his father was never really all that available to him, so, what started out as a would-be bonding experience - ended up with a young man fishing alone in a boat.\nWALTER: (inspecting the lure) And this young man... gave this to you?\nPETER: (laughing along with Astrid) Yes, Walter.\nWALTER: Can I come... with you and your friend?\nPETER: You know what Walter? I think that would make the trip.\nWALTER: Good... good.\n(sitting in a warm bubble bath, Olivia's hyper sensitive hearing activates. soap bubbles popping, conversations in other apartments, a child crying, a fly, a distant siren - all loud and clear... then silence)\n(dressed and looking for answers, Olivia pulls the note Nina gave to her to confirm she is in the correct location. inside she hobbles down the stairs with her cane, looking around at the patrons)\nSAM WEISS: (from behind the counter) If you want to bowl, we close in fifteen minutes.\nOLIVIA: No. Um... I'm looking for Sam Weiss. Is he here?\nSAM WEISS: Sam? No.\nOLIVIA: Well, do you know where I can find him?\nSAM WEISS: Atlanta, Georgia. He met a girl... moved away.\nOLIVIA: Oh. (starts to wander out) Thank you.\nSAM WEISS: That's it?\nOLIVIA: Excuse me?\nSAM WEISS: You're giving up? I tell you he met a girl and moved away, and you're just gonna give up?\nOLIVIA: You're Sam.\nSAM WEISS: Nina Sharp said you'd be coming by. (curious) Have the headaches started yet?\nOLIVIA: No.\nSAM WEISS: (matter-of-fact) They will. (places bowling shoes on the counter) What are you - a size eight?\n(stationed in front of the Selectric 251, Charlie types away, looking for more guidance)\n(he sits and reads as he receives fresh instructions)"

None of that vanilla hazelnut crap. Normal coffee, alright?\nUNIFORMED COP: (as he starts across the street) I already called it in.\nDAN GILLESPIE: (puts down paper and answers ringing cell phone) Yes, Colonel?\nRAYMOND GORDON: (over the phone) It's time. Get to 'Suburban Station'. He'll be wearing a black trench coat, carrying a black briefcase.\n(the police officer hangs-up and speeds away, leaving his abandoned partner standing in the street with two coffee cups)\nUNIFORMED COP: (calling over the radio to his partner) Gillespie, seriously, for the last time, where are you? Where are you, man? I'm gonna have to report this. Where are you, Gillespie? What are you doing?\nDAN GILLESPIE: (wandering the transit hub looking for his target, he disconnects his radio and interrupts his partners transmissions. as the public address announce boarding calls, he sees his target walk down from upstairs carrying a black briefcase. he prepares to draw his pistol, approaches the man and demands) Set the briefcase down now.\nPONYTAIL MAN: What's this about? What did I do?\nDAN GILLESPIE: (unholstering his pistol) You give me the briefcase now. (nearby electronic displays start to flicker)\nTRANSIT COP: (approaching the police officer) What's the problem here?\nDAN GILLESPIE: Got it under control. Give me the case. (taking the briefcase from the courier and walking away)\nTRANSIT COP: Hey, stop! You can't do that! You can't take that!\nCITIZEN: (from off-camera) What's the matter? (as Gillespie starts to crystallize before everyone in the terminal)\nDAN GILLESPIE: Aah! (as he explosively shatters to hundreds of bits)\nSAM WEISS: (as Olivia's hands shake and she fumbles with her bowling shoe) The rabbit goes around the tree then through the hole.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I know how to tie my shoes.\nSAM WEISS: Knowing how isn't the issue. You suffered some wicked head trauma. Don't think about your hands, don't think about the laces. Your shoes will get tied just fine.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, just by magic.\nSAM WEISS: No. But that would be pretty cool.\nOLIVIA: You know, what exactly did you do for Nina Sharp?\nSAM WEISS: (sits with Olivia) I taught her how to eat french fries. You know, pick one up, dip it in the ketchup, stick it in your mouth, repeat. Simple enough, unless you've got a cybernetic prosthetic arm. Nina was a mess. See, I prefer the bunny ears method to the one loop wrap. (ties Olivia's shoelace for her) But it does require more coordination. You'll get there.\nOLIVIA: (somewhat angry) Don't take this the wrong way, but I can't waste my time.\nSAM WEISS: Are you sleeping at night? You've got circles around your eyes, pale skin... you don't get more than two or three hours at a stretch, do you? Lingering pain from the accident?\nOLIVIA: In my leg and my shoulder.\nSAM WEISS: And you say the headaches haven't started yet?\nOLIVIA: No.\nSAM WEISS: Well, let me know when they do. You can take the shoes off now, we're done.\nOLIVIA: That's it?\nSAM WEISS: Yeah, unless you want to help me mop up the men's room. I'm closing now. (walking away) Come back tomorrow, Agent Dunham. We've got work to do.\nPETER: (seated near his father and reading the want-ads) Alright, how about this one? \"two bedroom, two bath loft in Oak Square. \"cook's kitchen, hardwood floors, and a breakfast nook.\"\nWALTER: Does it face the East?\nPETER: Uh... no. Riverview, so it faces North.\nWALTER: Then it won't do. I need the morning sun.\nPETER: Fine, how about this? \"three bedroom duplex in Allston, facing east.\" All the morning sun a waking scientist could want.\nWALTER: I never liked Allston. Arlington either, for that matter. I'm perfectly happy with our present accommodations.\nPETER: Well, I'm not, Walter. I need my own bedroom. (to Astrid sitting nearby) I woke up this morning to him singing an aria from 'Pagliacci'.\nASTRID: (studying her computer screen) Your father has a wonderful voice.\nPETER: Not when he's doing jumping jacks. And did I mention he was naked?\nWALTER: A good morning sets the tone for the day.\nASTRID: Come take a look at this. I've been running a filter for atypical F.B.I. case reports. I just got a hit. Some sort of bomb went off in Philadelphia. Single explosive device. Eleven dead, twenty-eight wounded. This last part is what caught my eye. They can't find any explosive residue at the scene. How's a bomb go off without leaving any trace of it afterwards?\nWALTER: Shall I get my coat, Peter?\nPETER: I'll call Dunham\nWALTER: (whispering) Farnsworth, get my portable chemistry set. This means bodies.\nAGENT TEVEZ: (escorting the science team through the carnage) The bomb guys don't know what to make of it. They say, given the nature of the wounds, you'd expect an explosive device filled with nails or steel ball bearings.\nOLIVIA: But it wasn't.\nAGENT TEVEZ: No. In fact... there's no forensic markers at all.\nOLIVIA: So what about eyewitnesses?\nAGENT TEVEZ: Oh, I've got half a dozen eye witnesses, but nobody who saw anything helpful.\nPETER: Huh, it's weird. This place has major anti-terrorism security. E.M.P. disabling devices at every entrance, explosive materials sensors...\nAGENT TEVEZ: We checked, and not a single sensor is tripped.\nOLIVIA: So what did the surveillance cameras show?\nAGENT TEVEZ: Nothing, nothing but magnetic static. It seems that whatever happened in here wiped the images.\nPETER: Would you mind if we see those tapes? (walks away)\nAGENT TEVEZ: I'll see what I can do.\nOLIVIA: Let me guess, you got a friend?\nPETER: Maybe I do.\nMEDICAL EXAMINER: (to Walter as he begins to examine a corpse) Excuse me, sir? Do you have a badge?\nWALTER: No, I don't have a badge. Do you?\nPETER: (to Olivia) I got it. (walks over to rescue the woman from Walter) Walter... What's going on?\nWALTER: This rather unpleasant young woman is interfering with my work.\nMEDICAL EXAMINER: Is he with you?\nPETER: Yeah, but don't hold that against me. We're F.B.I.\nMEDICAL EXAMINER: Go ahead.\nPETER: So? What is it?\nWALTER: Shrapnel, I believe, from the bomb. Some sort of crystal. Hard as a diamond. Salty. Silica, I guess. Well, I'll need to examine the rest of the bodies, if -- (to the M.E.) if that's alright with you, Miss. Thank you.\n(Peter notices more crystalline pieces embedded around the scene. Broyles walks downstairs and joins Olivia)\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham... I spoke with our counter-terrorism analysts.\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm?\nBROYLES: No one stepped forward to claim responsibility. And there's been no increase in chatter from our usual suspects.\nPETER: (approaches quickly) Hey, guys, I found this wedged in a bench. It's a badge -- Philly P.D., Officer Gillespie.\nBROYLES: Were there any police among the wounded taken to the hospital?\nPETER: unht-uh.\nOLIVIA: So, where'd he go?\nWALTER: Peter! (joins the trio) I was wrong. The crystal... I think it's not geologic in origin, after all. In fact, I'm certain it's organic.\nOLIVIA: (looking at what Walter is holding) Is that an ear?\nPETER: Well... I think Walter might have just found Officer Gillespie.\n(wearing aprons, the two look through magnifying glasses and chat)\nWALTER: This looks like fungiform papillae. Taste buds. (drops the body part into a bowl that Astrid is holding for him)\nASTRID: Tongue? Mm-hmm. Walter, as much as I am enjoying this anatomy lesson, what exactly are we doing here?\nWALTER: Well, that's obvious, my dear. We're searching for clues. Scientific evidence to reveal what type of device this man was wearing which caused him to harden, then shatter.\nASTRID: I understand Peter's looking for a new place for you guys to live.\nWALTER: It occurs to me, Agent Farnsworth, that I've never asked you where you live.\nASTRID: Where I live?\nWALTER: Yeah. (puts another body part in a bowl) Diaphragm.\nASTRID: Well... most of the time I live here, but my apartment is in Sommerville.\nWALTER: You should go for a walk sometime explore the neighborhood. The other day I turned the wrong way in the street, and discovered that Busby's... has the world's best apple fritters. You see, I have everything I need where we live now.\nASTRID: I know what you mean, Walter. I'm a creature of habit, too. Of course, you never would've found Busby's apple fritters if you hadn't gone the wrong way down a street.\nWALTER: You really should try them, they're quite delicious. (drops another body part into the bowl for Astrid) Brain.\n(studying distorted and refined video images on the monitor)\nSLIM JOE: Okay, that's it. That's the best I can do.\nPETER: Well, that must be Gillespie. But I don't see a bomb.\nSLIM JOE: Then it cuts out. (as he loses the images)\nPETER: You know, I told her you were a genius, Joe. Don't prove me wrong.\nSLIM JOE: (laughingly) Then you're gonna need a smarter genius.\nOLIVIA: (to Joe) Do you have any idea how something like this could happen?\nSLIM JOE: The static? No. Maybe radio wave interference. Certain high frequencies can tweak electronic signals.\nPETER: Look at the time code. That's about twenty seconds before the bomb went off.\nOLIVIA: So why do we lose picture before the explosion?\nPETER: How's it going, Walter? Any theories?\nWALTER: Several. Peter, do you remember that jigsaw puzzle we put together when you were a kid?\nPETER: Uh... the jigsaw? No.\nWALTER: As I recall, her name was Melissa... something. Five hundred pieces.\nPETER: (knowing laugh) Yes. Yes, I do remember. Melissa was a Playmate. Miss July, right? Putting together a jigsaw of a nude centerfold was Walter's idea of how to explain -- what was it? Human reproduction to his ten-year-old son. So what does any of that have to do with the bomb in Philadelphia?\nWALTER: Patience, son. Voila. (shows Peter the partially reconstructed face of the lost officer)\nASTRID: Meet Officer Gillespie.\nPETER: Fantastic. So apart from the obvious, anything out of the ordinary?\nWALTER: Needle marks between the toes. It was some form of transformative serum, I would think. I can't say what yet. (as Peter inspects the partially recomposed foot) From his tissues, it appears to cause a chemical reaction on the cellular level that both solidifies the water in his cells - and emitted massive energy, which shattered the body.\nPETER: What are you saying, Walter? You think he did this to himself? On purpose?\nWALTER: Well, I stopped counting at forty-seven needle marks. I can't imagine it was an accident. When you think about it... wearing a bomb is rather unimaginative. This way there's no need to smuggle in an explosive device, because--\nPETER: Officer Gillespie was the bomb.\nWALTER: Fascinating, yes?\n(sitting somberly in her front room with Olivia, as Peter walks around and looks at photos)\nSUSAN GILLESPIE: ...we were planning to start a family. I can't believe he's not coming home. Dan always came home. After every shift on the job, two tours in Iraq, He always came home. No one would tell me what happened. Just that it was... some kind of bomb.\nOLIVIA: We're still investigating. I'm so sorry.\nPETER: Where was he stationed?\nSUSAN GILLESPIE: In Ramadi. Did you serve?\nPETER: No, a civilian contractor, based out of Baghdad. But from what I remember, there was heavy fighting in Ramadi.\nOLIVIA: Was he on any medication, or under any sort of medical care? (as she starts to take a sip from her cup, her hand shakes excessively and she puts the cup down. Peter notices, with concern)\nSUSAN GILLESPIE: No. No, Dan was healthy. And I don't understand, what does this have to do with the explosion?\nPETER: (as Olivia grimaces in pain, puts her hand to her head - she has a mental flash of the interior of an elevator. a mirror image of the number '15' is illuminated above the door) You alright, Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Excuse me, do you have a bathroom that I could use?\nSUSAN GILLESPIE: Yeah, it's down the hall. (to Olivia as she stands and staggers along the hallway)\n(Olivia continues to the bathroom. highly disoriented, she sees more flashes, all in dark amber. herself in a room, pushing a button in an elevator, people standing in an elevator, part of a man's face inverted above her, twin skyscrapers, William Bell breathing from an oxygen mask. she reaches the toilet and vomits into it. relaxing slightly, she notices a dislodged tile in the wall behind the sink. she pulls the tile free and finds two small medical kits in the cavity. one with serum cartridges, the other with injection needles)\nPETER: (knocking in the door) Dunham, you alright?\nOLIVIA: (holding out the open medical kits) Mrs. Gillespie, can you tell me what these are?\nSUSAN GILLESPIE: I don't know. I've never seen them before.\n(outside and walking back to the car)\nOLIVIA: Dan Gillespie doesn't fit the profile of a suicide bomber.\nPETER: Well, how do you explain this stuff? 'cause I'm assuming it's more than likely that this is exactly what Walter was talking about. What turned him into a bomb.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, well, I can't yet. But I mean, what makes someone blow themselves up? Typically, they're either waging a war, or making a statement. Gillespie didn't seem like a guy sending a message. He was a dedicated cop and soldier just getting his life back together. It doesn't make sense.\nPETER: Is there anything else on your mind?\nOLIVIA: Like what?\nPETER: The headache. Didn't the doctor say that would happen?\nOLIVIA: Uh, they said they might, uh - that it was totally normal. We should get that back to Walter. (gets in the car) Maybe he can figure out where those vials came from.\n(late at night, Diane Burgess slips out of bed quietly without waking her husband. in the bathroom she opens a medical kit she has hidden there and fills a syringe with serum. with her foot elevated, she injects herself between the toes)\nRAYMOND GORDON: (surprising her and offering to help load groceries in the minivan) Let me help you with that.\nDIANE BURGESS: Colonel.\nRAYMOND GORDON: We need to talk, Captain Burgess. (settling in the front seats) I'm calling you back to active status. You're going to D.C. on Friday. (hands her a file and a phone) Hotel reservations, plane tickets all -- self-explanatory. That phone, keep it with you at all times. Check into the hotel, wait for me to call you with further instructions. Do you have a cover story prepared for your family?\nDIANE BURGESS: Yes, sir. I'll say I'm visiting my sister. She lives in Georgetown.\nRAYMOND GORDON: Have you been taking the serum?\nDIANE BURGESS: Yes, sir.\nRAYMOND GORDON: Good, because from this moment on Tin Man parameters are in effect.\n(hobbling down the stairs and over to Sam, Olivia is in some discomfort)\nOLIVIA: So... how'd you know?\nSAM WEISS: The headaches started?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nSAM WEISS: Well, it's about time.\nOLIVIA: Can you just cut the Yoda crap and tell me what's happening to me?\nSAM WEISS: (taking her over to a lane with a shoe box) The short version... the headaches mean you've finally sparked the battery. You've been experiencing... an acute nominal aphasia, Agent Dunham. It's common with head trauma. Parts of your brain are still asleep. Once they wake up, all that memory will get flushed out.\nOLIVIA: When?\nSAM WEISS: When?\nOLIVIA: When will I get my memory back?\nSAM WEISS: (hands her a bowling shoe) You know, everywhere you go the scoring apparatuses have changed. Computers, no fun. Here, we do things old school, with a dull pencil and all your third grade math skills. (hands her a pencil)\nOLIVIA: You know, this is ridiculous. I'm not bowling, I can't even walk without this damn cane.\nSAM WEISS: You're not bowling. I've got a kid's league coming in here, you're gonna keep score.\nOLIVIA: How is that gonna help my memory? I mean, how is that gonna help me at all?\nSAM WEISS: Well, for starters, it might teach you some patience. (walks away)\n(Astrid, Peter and Walter take a meal break in the lab)\nWALTER: Ah, is that food I smell? Bless you! (ravenously attacking lunch) Mm-hmm, mm. Mm-hmm. (sharing his findings) While examining Officer Gillespie, I've discovered something else. Given the amount of serum that we found in his tissue, and the rate at which it would've metabolized, I suspect that he would've had to inject it every day for a very long time.\nPETER: Well, how long?\nWALTER: At least a year, I would think.\nPETER: A year? That would mean Gillespie started injecting while he was still on his tour in Iraq. (to Astrid) Did his Army personnel file come through yet?\nASTRID: I haven't seen it. Let me check though. (she heads to her workstation)\nWALTER: Oh, yeah. Interestingly... when the serum is first introduced or injected, it's fairly harmless. But then something else occurs, a secondary reaction. Some sort of trigger causes these bombs to blast apart. The triggers -- (Gene moos loudly) Peter... if you are going to eat that cheeseburger in here, could you at least be a little discreet?\nPETER: (demonstrative - takes a large bite of his burger. Gene takes exception and moos louder. appeasing Gene, Peter stops and puts his sandwich down) -- Fine. This trigger, could it be a radio wave? There was some sort of interference on the security tapes inside the train station. Most likely caused by radio waves.\nWALTER: Yes. I suppose so.\nASTRID: Peter, I've got Gillespie's military file. What's 'cyanogen chloride'?\nPETER: It's a chemical weapon. (joins Astrid and reads the file on her monitor) His whole unit was exposed to cyanogen? According to this file, Gillespie should've died in Iraq.\n(walking in an inner city green area, Peter and Olivia sell Broyles on a course of action)\nPETER: Four words that should never show up in a sentence...'classified-experimental-military-project'. How much you wanna bet that 'Tin Man' has everything to do with those injections that Gillespie was taking?\nOLIVIA: It says here that \"Project Tin Man\" was shut down.\nBROYLES: Shortly after Dan Gillespie returned home. And all names of U.S. Military personnel associated with the project were redacted from the record.\nOLIVIA: (looks at file) But it still lists Malik Yusef, Abbas Khalef, and Howar Ziad as Iraqi doctors who worked on the program. Where are they?\nBROYLES: Presumably still in the country. CentCom has agreed to look for them, but it may take a few weeks to track anything down.\nPETER: I may be able to help. But I'm gonna need a few things first. I need to go back to Iraq. I know somebody who can help us find those doctors.\nBROYLES: Seems a long way to go for a maybe.\nPETER: Well, we have to assume that Gillespie was not a solitary event. There may be others out there like him, walking bombs, we don't have two weeks to wait.\nBROYLES: What is it you need?\nPETER: Private air transportation, $20,000 in cash, and a passport without my real name on it.\nBROYLES: Oh?\nPETER: I'm still on a couple of watch lists.\nBROYLES: Then you're gonna need a Federal Agent with you as well. I'm reluctant to send you, Agent Dunham. With that said, we need to keep this trip between us. You look after each other. (walks away)\nPETER: (to Olivia) You ready for this?\nOLIVIA: Baghdad here we come. (follows Broyles)\nOLIVIA: (entering a crowded local tavern) Maybe I should wait outside.\nPETER: Then what would I do? You're the one with a gun. (after heading to the back and finding the man he came to see. in Arabic) As-Salamu Slaikum.\nAHMED: (in Arabic) There were rumors that you had been killed.\nPETER: (in Arabic) Then I suppose I am a ghost. Can we join you? (nods to Olivia)\nAHMED: (in Arabic) Does you friend speak Arabic?\nOLIVIA: (in Arabic) Just a bit. And not very well.\nAHMED: In that case, we speak English.\nPETER: I need your help, Ahmed. A U.S. Military program named \"Tin Man\" was operating out of a hospital in Samarra. I need to find one of your Iraqi doctors who was working in that program. I can pay you, of course.\nAHMED: When I heard you had been killed, I knew this could not be true. Because a person like you is good at one thing. More than anything else, a person like you is good at looking out for yourself. Now you are here... asking for my help?\nPETER: Yes, I am.\nAHMED: Maybe someone else will want your money. I don't.\nPETER: Ahmed... a lot of innocent lives may be on the line.\nAHMED: I see. And this is something you care about now?\nPETER: Yes, I do. I may be able to save them... with your help.\nAHMED: What are the names of these doctors? (takes a list from Peter) Have some tea. I will see what I can do. (walks off)\nOLIVIA: You gonna tell me what that was about?\nPETER: No.\nASTRID: (joins Walter as he inserts a hypodermic needle into the fleshy opening of a medium-sized watermelon) Doctor Bishop, what did I tell you about experimenting with fruit? I just cleaned this lab up yesterday.\nWALTER: Relax, my dear. Just injecting a very small amount of the serum into the watermelon. Just to crystallize it. The serum we found at Gillespie's house told us how he became a bomb - but - the question remains... what triggered it?\nASTRID: So you're using radio waves like Peter suggested?\nWALTER: Yes. Radio waves would also explain the eyewitness reports of flashing lights at the train station before the officer exploded. Quite ingenious, really. (adjust dials) The same principle applied to proximity fuses and World War Two aerial bombs... (lighting in the lab flickers) in fact, my Uncle Henry was killed by one in the 'Battle of Guadalcanal'. Oh, Astrid! This is it! Quickly, what's the frequency?\nASTRID: 331.6 Megahertz. (as the melon crystallizes and the lab equipment falls silent) What happened? It stopped.\nWALTER: I'm not sure. (the end of the melon suddenly explodes) It works. (proudly)\nASTRID: (unamused) No more fruit, Walter.\nPETER: (waiting for Ahmed to return) Ready for something a little harder than tea?\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nPETER: (in Arabic to bartender) Two Red Russians?\nOLIVIA: Red Russians\nPETER: Yeah, mint tea and vodka.\nOLIVIA: Sounds weird and awful. (sips and sneers) Actually it's worse.\nPETER: You'll get used to it.\nOLIVIA: How long were you here?\nPETER: Which time? I had to leave a couple of times.\nOLIVIA: Seems like you made a name for yourself.\nPETER: I've been known to leave an impression. (raise his glass to toast) To all that's weird.\n(Ahmed returns with a silent, affirmative nod for a meeting)\n(entering a busy commercial kitchen)\nAHMED: (making introductions for the busy chef) Doctor Malik Yusef... Peter Bishop, Olivia Dunham. (Yusef and Peter greet one another in arabic)\nMALIK YUSEF: (in arabic) You have questions about my efforts during the war?\nPETER: (in Arabic) Doctor. We understand you worked in an American-run hospital?\nMALIK YUSEF: (in Arabic) Yes. (hesitantly) Saving lives. And look what I get in return. My own people shun me. (continues in English) They consider me a threat.\nOLIVIA: We were hoping to ask you some questions about a program that you worked on. A program called \"Tin Man\".\nMALIK YUSEF: No, I do not know anything about this. (turns to begin working)\nAHMED: (in Arabic) It's okay Doctor. They can be trusted.\nMALIK YUSEF: (continuing the conversation in a quieter part of restaurant) The program didn't work, it was too dangerous. The soldiers had been exposed to a synthetic neurotoxin. A nerve agent developed under Saddam.\nPETER: Cyanogen?\nMALIK YUSEF: Yes. We had been trying to find a way to neutralize it to counteract the affects.\nOLIVIA: And that's what they called Tin Man?\nMALIK YUSEF: We had developed a... a treatment. Daily injections of a serum. We treated over two hundred soldiers. Only a few of them survived.\nOLIVIA: We know of one, a Daniel Gillespie.\nMALIK YUSEF: (smiles fondly) Daniel, kind man. Um, over the course of the program, there were three others.\nPETER: Do you remember their names?\nMALIK YUSEF: Of course, I saved their lives. It was Joan Klump, Ross Cavanaugh, and Diane Burgess...\nANDREW BURGESS: (at the Burgess home Diane anxiously watches from inside as her daughter plays in the yard. her husband finds her and offers) Okay, Diane, you're all set. Suitcase is at the front door. Are you sure you don't want me to drive you to the airport?\nMALIK YUSEF: ...but it was too dangerous. The serum had an unintentional byproduct. We had discovered that after it built up in human tissue. It reacted in a very unexpected way...\nOLIVIA: ...it turned people into bombs.\nMALIK YUSEF: Yes. How did you know that?\nOLIVIA: Doctor Yusef, how many other people knew about this?\nMALIK YUSEF: Five doctors, a dozen U.S. officers, and whoever they reported to, I suppose.\nPETER: Someone is triggering these people to explode. It could be anyone.\nMALIK YUSEF: There was a man, a colonel. When the program was shut down, he argued it should be continued.\nOLIVIA: Do you remember his name?\nMALIK YUSEF: Gordon. Colonel Raymond Gordon...\nPETER: (in Arabic, thanks the doctor for his assistance)\n(Gordon sits outside of the Burgess house. hidden from sight in his vehicle, across the street, Gordon looks-on as Diane says good-bye to her husband and daughter)\nMALIK YUSEF: ...a word of warning... Gordon is a vicious man. He has no regard for human life.\nBROYLES: (standing before a room of law enforcement agents) You all have briefing packets in front of you, so I'll just point out the highlights. Information has come to this agency that a bomb may be detonated today somewhere in this city. (the Bishops listen from the back of the room) But in this instance, that bomb is a human being. Three of the four known operatives of \"Project Tin Man\" have been accounted for. Daniel Gillespie you're all familiar with. Two others have been taken into protective custody. Which leaves Diane Burgess. (Agents interview Andrew Burgess at his home) We believe Captain Burgess traveled to D.C. this morning, under an alias, though we do not have any intelligence on her potential target. A B.O.L.O. has been issued to all Metro and State police in the area. All potential high-value targets are under close surveillance. Agent Dunham and I will coordinate Captain Burgess' apprehension. (summoning her to brief) Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: (standing to brief) Based on our investigation, it's likely there is a second suspect controlling detonation from a remote location. (pointing to an image on the briefing monitor) We believe it's this man, Colonel Raymond Gordon. The Pentagon lost contact with Colonel Gordon six months ago. He's off the grid. Officially designated a 'rogue operative'. Now Based on Doctor Bishop's analysis, the explosion is triggered by a specific V.H.F. frequency. (an agent quietly takes a phone call in the room) Now if we can locate Captain Burgess in time to get within range, we may be able to jam the signal and prevent her detonation. On that point, we suspect that Diane Burgess is unaware she is being used in a suicide bombing. Which means that she is also a potential victim here. (Broyles is quietly informed about the phone call) We're gonna do everything that we can to get her back to her family alive.\nBROYLES: Diane Burgess has just been located. She's in a D.C. Metro cab. Dispatchers say she's headed to the Federal Center Metro Station. We have time to set up before she arrives. (a taxi works its way thru traffic, as SWAT vans and government vehicle cnverge on the Metro Station) Our objectives are as follows - to prevent the detonation of Captain Diane Burgess and to apprehend Colonel Raymond Gordon.\nBROYLES: (exiting his vehicle as he arrives and answering his radio) This is Broyles, go ahead.\nTECH #1: (over the radio) Video surveillance and 3-D triangulation model online.\nBROYLES: Stand by, we'll wait for Diane Burgess.\nTECH #1: (to Broyles as he enters the command vehicle with the science team) Snipers ready. Target sighted, arriving at Federal Center Station, South Portal. (on monitor, she exits the cab, heads for the transit building and answers a cell phone) The phone's encrypted, sir. We can't tap into it.\nAGENT ON RADIO: There's no sign of the Colonel outside of the station.\nBROYLES: (to the radio) Copy that, keep an eye on it. (to his technician) Where are we on that signal?\nTECH #1: Attempting to acquire signal 331.6 Megahertz.\nWALTER: Excuse me, Agent Broyles... is there an E.M.P. detection device in this station?\nBROYLES: All capitol transportation hubs had them installed after 9-11. What's the problem?\nWALTER: No problem. It's just that the security device can scramble all types of radio wave triggers.\nBROYLES: That sounds to me like a good thing.\nTECH #1: Frequency acquired. Jamming. Ready.\nBROYLES: (to technician) Prepare to jam the signal. (to radio) Stand by to apprehend target.\nWALTER: I'm thinking that if the Colonel wants Ms. Burgess inside the building. Then in order to trigger the explosion, he must be inside as well.\nPETER: Which means that once he starts broadcasting, we should be able to triangulate his position. But in order to do that, we'd have to leave the frequency open. We can't jam it.\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) This could be our only chance to find Gordon and apprehend him.\nAGENT ON RADIO: Target's about to enter the station. Do we move, sir?\nBROYLES: I said stand-by.\nOLIVIA: How long from when he activates the signal until she detonates?\nWALTER: Thirty seconds, at best.\nPETER: That should give us long enough to be able to locate him.\nBROYLES: (to radio) All units hold position. Let the target get into the building. (to Olivia and Peter) Go.\nDIANE BURGESS: (inside the building in a large lobby, she answers her cell phone) Yes, Colonel?\nRAYMOND GORDON: Your contact will be wearing a black trench coat. He will have a briefcase for you. Accept the briefcase and proceed by taxi back to your hotel.\nDIANE BURGESS: Is that it, sir?\nRAYMOND GORDON: That's it, Captain. I'll meet you there.\nDIANE BURGESS: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. (hangs-up)\nBROYLES: (over the radio) According to this schematic, Diane Burgess should be standing near the northwest side of the terminal. We're still waiting for Gordon to activate the V.H.F. signal.\nPETER: (by radio) I got her. She's by the front entrance.\nBROYLES: (radio reply) Keep an eye on her. (to technician) Do we have anything from Gordon yet?\nTECH #1: The signal hasn't been activated yet, sir.\nPETER: (over radio) She's on the move. Still no sign of Gordon.\nWALTER: (to Broyles) That -- that's it. That's the V.H.F. signal. She'll detonate in thirty seconds.\nBROYLES: (to technician) Agent, tell me where Gordon is.\nTECH #1: Something's wrong. Sir, the signal's scrambling our equipment. I can't get a lock on Gordon.\nBROYLES: (to radio) The signal is scrambling our equipment.\nDIANE BURGESS: (to courier holding breifcase) I think you have something for me.\nWALTER: (to those in the command vehicle) One Mississippi... two Mississippi... (clarifying for Broyles) - thirty seconds.\nCOURIER: (to Burgess) I don't know what you're talking about.\nOLIVIA: (over radio) Okay, we've got her speaking to a man with a briefcase. It is not Gordon. Can you get a lock on the signal?\nTECH #1: We can't get a lock.\nBROYLES: Then jam that signal. We're jamming the signal, I'm not risking any lives to capture Gordon.\nTECH #1: Sir, it's -- it's not working. The signal's too strong for our equipment. I'm locked out.\nBROYLES: (over radio) We have a problem. Dunham - attempts to jam the signal have failed. She's going to detonate.\nBROYLES: (broadcasting on his handheld command radio) We have a problem. The signal cannot be jammed. I repeat, the signal... (as the static increases)\nOLIVIA: (on her tactical radio) Peter, I think we just lost radio contact. We need to find Gordon.\nPETER: (replying on his radio) Copy that. The trigger's been activated, we don't have much time.\nCOURIER: (to Burgess as she reaches for the briefcase) I don't know who you are.\nDIANE BURGESS: Oh, my God! (as her hand and wrist start to crystallize)\nPETER: I spotted Gordon. I'm taking him out.\nRAYMOND GORDON: Ah! Ugh! (as Peter tackles him and strikes him. the remote detonation device falls to the floor nearby. Olivia grabs the device, but can't deactivate it.)\nWALTER: ...twenty-four Mississippi... twenty-five Mississippi... twenty-six Mississippi... (Burgess continues to crystallize further up her arms. Olivia drops the detonator and pulverizes it with her cane. It deactivates and Burgess begins to return to normal, collapsing to the ground)\nTECH #1: We're back online, the signal has stopped.\nBROYLES: All agents move in.\nAGENTS: F.B.I.!! (pulling Peter off of Gordon as he continues to pound him)\nPETER: Ugh! Ugh!\n(Olivia walks over to help Burgess while Walter claps, delighted at their success - managing to coax a rare smile out of Broyles in the process)\n(some soothing oldie rock music plays on the portable stereo as Astrid sits and works at a counter. Peter walks over to the corpse and covers what remains of Officer Gillespie, then returns to the microscope station. Walter joins him with the local want ads)\nPETER: What's this? (looks at the advertisement)\nWALTER: An apartment. Two bedroom, semi-detached. Furnished housing for professors. It's a nice neighborhood. Down the block from where Belly used to live.\nPETER: (pleased) I'll call Broyles, see if we can lease it.\nSAM WEISS: (sitting at a lane and measuring the length of Olivia's hand) Okay, seven and a quarter inches. Hmm.\nOLIVIA: Why \"hmm\"?\nSAM WEISS: Well, I think your hand just seems smaller to me. Okay, we're good.\nOLIVIA: We're good, what does that mean?\nSAM WEISS: It means that's all for tonight. Go home.\nOLIVIA: (perturbed) I just got here.\nSAM WEISS: I know, but I'm tired. It's been a long day. You look like you could use some sleep yourself. (walks to ball return and picks-up a ball) Come back tomorrow. By then I'll have found you the perfect bowling ball.\nOLIVIA: (placing her pistol to Sam's ear) Now you listen to me you son of a bitch. I am not here to bowl, or to try on shoes, or to have you play games with my head. I am here because I was told that you could fix me. (both turn and look at where Olivia had been sitting. her cane rests there, unneeded)\nSAM WEISS: Take care, Agent Dunham.\n(both men sit calmly at a table in the interrogation room)\nRAYMOND GORDON: (steadfast) ...meanwhile, we go through our lives unaware. The enemy is among us and nobody's doing anything about it. We don't have any idea the end is coming. So we had to take matters into our own hands. We had to send them a message.\nBROYLES: What was in the briefcase?\nRAYMOND GORDON: They told you I was crazy, didn't they? The Pentagon. They said I'd had a psychiatric break. I told them what I'm telling you. That they are here. Collecting data. Making observations. That's what's in the briefcase. They've been planning for war. And they've been passing the information via courier right under our noses.\n(as the interview continues, a young man in a long dark coat walks into a diner and delivers a briefcase to a seated man, then leaves)\nBROYLES: Who are 'they'?\nRAYMOND GORDON: We don't know who they are. But I can tell you what they want. They want to exterminate us.\n(the man seated in the diner pours an entire container of black pepper over his roast beef and jalape\u00f1o sandwich, then opens the briefcase he received from the courier)\nRAYMOND GORDON: So they're studying us... our culture, our technology, our science... and they plan to use it against us. One way or another. We'll find out who they are. But by then, I suppose it won't really matter.\n(The Observer pulls images out of the briefcase. High-tech surveillance images of one Walter Bishop)\nRAYMOND GORDON: Because whatever's in those cases is gonna destroy us all."

I'd hate for these popsicles to melt.\nKURT LARSEN: I don't think we have to worry about that.\nSECURITY GUARD: Cargo is secure. (closes and locks truck) Who is this guy? (to other guard about approaching vehicle)\nSMITH: (stops car and gets out) Hey, I was wondering if I could get some directions.\nSECURITY GUARD: What are you doing here? You're trespassing, pal. Why don't you get in your car and turn around?\nSMITH: Yeah, sure. (takes pistols from waistband and fires repeatedly at guards)\nTRUCK DRIVER: (hiding behind van) Oh, my god! Son of a bitch! We got to call -- (shot from behind)\nSMITH: (to Larsen) Anyone else in the warehouse?\nKURT LARSEN: That's it. The keys are in his pocket. (thief takes keys from driver) Let me know if he's in there. You know where to reach me -- (is shot from behind by surviving guard)\n(Smith drives-off with cargo, leaving everyone else behind on the ground)\nSECURITY GUARD: (fires repeatedly at Larsen) Aah! (killing Larsen with final round. falls and dies himself)\nASTRID: (chopping on a cutting board) One hundred, Walter.\nWALTER: (joins her and inspects her work) Almost. Fifty more chops. (turns to greet the new arrival) Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Walter, hey. So, you said you wanted to see me.\nWALTER: Oh, I had an idea. I think I may be able to help you retrieve your memories from the accident, when you disappeared from the automobile in New York.\nOLIVIA: I - I remember that bit.\nWALTER: Of course you do.\nPETER: (joins the group) Walter, I thought that we agreed that this was a stupid idea. (Astrid starts the blender)\nWALTER: Oh, no, you decided. I still maintain that the principle is perfectly sound.\nPETER: He wants you to eat worms.\nWALTER: Not just worms, flatworms! (Astrid stops the blender) The thing is, Agent Dunham, I recalled an experiment that Belly and I did w-where we trained a handful of flatworms to respond to light. We then crushed them up and fed them to other worms. It was Belly's idea.\nASTRID: (slightly disgusted) Because who wouldn't think to do that?\nWALTER: The point is that these other worms, without having been trained, began to respond to light. It seems the first worms transferred their memories to the other worms through ingestion.\nPETER: Right, but that still has nothing to do with stimulating Agent Dunham's memory.\nWALTER: How will we know unless we try? That's why it's called an experiment, Peter.\nPETER: Thanks. I know what an experiment is.\n(Olivia slips away from the bickering and swallows a large gulp of the worm puree)\nWALTER: If Archimedes never decided to take a bath--\nASTRID: Uh, guys?\nWALTER: (turns to see Olivia's situation) Astrid, water. (to Olivia) I was going to mix it with strawberries.\nASTRID: (answers cell phone) \"Bishop's Deli.\"\nBROYLES: (to arriving trio) This is what we know so far. Facility manager arrived to work this morning at 6:30, saw the bodies and called it in to the local P.D.\nPETER: So the robbery took place in the middle of the night. That makes three cryogenic facilities in a week, same M.O. As Chicago and New York.\nBROYLES: Yeah, but Chicago was a straight \"B\" and \"E.\" But in all three cases, the target was the same.\nPETER: Frozen heads. Which does bring up several obvious questions -- first of which, what the hell for?\nBROYLES: Police recovered ten shell casings from a nine millimeter. Looks like a single perp rolled up and dropped four men, two of whom were armed.\nWALTER: (interrupts anxiously, to Broyles) Excuse me. Can I see the body that's bleeding silver now? Fascinating.\n(inspecting the corpse and collecting samples)\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: Perfect, son. It has the consistency of mercury. (collecting a vial of the leaked bodily fluids)\nOLIVIA: (continuing the briefing privately) These robberies are obviously connected. We should pull the files on New York and Chicago.\nBROYLES: I'll make some calls, tell the local agents that we're taking over the investigations.\nOLIVIA: (as Broyles walks away) Yes, sir. (as Peter approaches she has more cryptic visions of Bell, a ringing ships bell, Bell speaking backwards, a written message and Bells' Manhattan office tower)\nPETER: (sensing she is off a little) You okay?\nOLIVIA: Uh, yeah. So, um, what does Walter think?\nPETER: Meet Mister Silver blood. Walter thinks it's actually mercury. (hands her the evidence bag)\nOLIVIA: Mercury?\nWALTER: (alone with the corpse, he is joined) Agent Francis, hello.\nCHARLIE: Hey.\nWALTER: You alright? You look pale.\nCHARLIE: Yeah. I didn't get much sleep last night.\nWALTER: Oh. I may be able to help you with that... a little cannabis before bedtime does wonders, huh? (jokingly, as Peter joins them, he removes a small electronic device from the pocket of the corpse) I recognize this. This is the device the shape-shifter used.\n(shaving the hair off of the stolen skulls and discarding them when he doesn't find what he is looking for, Smith is joined a fellow shape-shifter morphed as Charlie Francis)\nSMITH: You look like hell.\nCHARLIE: That was, uh... that was sloppy. You killed four men last night, including one of our own.\nSMITH: There's nothing to link him to us.\nCHARLIE: Maybe not, but now the F.B.I. -- they have him. They understand what he is.\nSMITH: You've been in this body too long. You're dying. You need to get back home and get fitted with a new conversion device. I'd let you use mine... but what would be the point.\nCHARLIE: Yeah. It wouldn't do anything anyway.\nSMITH: You've asked for extraction. (shaves the last skull)\nCHARLIE: They say not until the mission is done.\nSMITH: They're real sweethearts. Damn. That's the last one. He's not here. There's another facility in North Carolina. (closes rear door on van)\nCHARLIE: I have another idea. Olivia Dunham is starting to remember her time on the other side. I'm thinking she may know where it's hidden.\nSMITH: His head?\nCHARLIE: Yeah.\nSMITH: What makes you think that?\nCHARLIE: If Bell knows that we're looking for it, it seemed like a likely reason why he'd bring her over to the other side.\nSMITH: Well, if you're right, and you don't want that body to be your last, then I suggest you do whatever it takes to make her remember. (walks off leaving his associate brooding)\nBROYLES: Why?\nOLIVIA: Why...\nBROYLES: Why are shape-shifting soldiers from another universe stealing frozen heads?\nOLIVIA: The most likely explanation that we can think of is that they're looking for a specific head, but they don't know where it is.\nBROYLES: Okay. Then who?\nOLIVIA: We don't know. These facilities pride themselves on secrecy. So despite the thefts, none of them have been willing to give up their client lists. What about the other device, the one we found a few weeks ago? Did it give any indication who these people are?\nBROYLES: Unfortunately, the other device is broken. We asked Massive Dynamic to see what they could make of it, but apparently they've been stumped.\nOLIVIA: Well, this one doesn't appear to be damaged. So maybe Peter can figure something out.\nBROYLES: I suppose he knows a guy?\nOLIVIA: He knew enough about engineering to fake his way into M.I.T.\nBROYLES: Well, let me know if you learn anything. In the meantime, I'm considering giving you a protective detail.\nOLIVIA: A protective detail? Why?\nBROYLES: The last time Peter showed me one of these devices, its owner had just tried to kill you.\nOLIVIA: I'm not worried, 'cause that was six weeks ago. So if a shape-shifting assassin wanted me dead... then I would be.\nWALTER: Let's see how this thing operates.\nASTRID: What are you saying, that this is not a person?\nWALTER: My dear, I'm not certain that you're not simply a figment of my imagination. No, this is certainly not human, rather a highly advanced technology -- A mechano-organic hybrid. I suspect that they produce, or possibly ingest the mercury, and that it controls the tissue, instructing it to take, and maintain shapes.\nASTRID: What?\nWALTER: We have to call Agent Dunham. I need to talk to her right away.\nASTRID: Okay.\nPETER: You know what this reminds me of? Did you ever see that movie - Invasion of the Body Snatchers?\nOLIVIA: Which version -- Don Siegel or Philip Kaufman?\nPETER: [laughs] The remake. I remember when I saw that movie, I was so scared, I didn't sleep for a week. I was convinced that if I fell asleep, I was gonna be replaced by a pod person.\nOLIVIA: Is this your way of trying to ask me if I'm scared?\nPETER: No, of course not. I mean, I figure if you were scared, you'd tell me, right? Besides, I figure between the two of us, you're the one that carries the gun. [static] What the hell?\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nPETER: I'm not sure. I was just trying to turn it on, but... (high-pitched whine) looks like this thing is streaming data... and lots of it.\n[cell phone rings]\nWALTER: I've got good news and bad news. The bad news is that the shape-shifter's blood is forty-seven percent mercury.\nPETER: Which means?\nWALTER: Well, I'm not sure, but I went back and re-examined the autopsy reports for the first shape-shifter.\nOLIVIA: And?\nWALTER: And... her blood sample is perfectly normal -- just traces of mercury, which would suggest that, despite what we thought back then...\nOLIVIA: ...she wasn't a shape-shifter at all.\nWALTER: I'm afraid so.\nOLIVIA: So the shape-shifter is still alive, which means by now, it could be disguised as anyone.\nWALTER: And you could still be in danger. Would you like to hear the good news now? I think I may know how to find him. Rebecca Kibner. [audio fast-forwards]\nPETER: You showed us this. The girl you experimented on.\nWALTER: Yes, to see things others could not.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Oh, yes, a soldier... Oh, from somewhere else. [laughs]\nWALTER: There.\nREBECCA KIBNER: He's glowing, man.\nWALTER: If she was able to identify the shape-shifter once, she may be able to do it again.\nREBECCA KIBNER: He's from a place that looks like this, but it's not here. He's-- [gasps] He's from another universe, man.\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone walking across campus) Hey, looks like we may have some leads on how to identify the shape-shifters. Walter has an idea, and I have a thought about the device. But in the meantime, can you check in with Broyles, see if there's something new from the crime scenes?\nCHARLIE: Sure thing. [inhales sharply] hmm...\nSTORE CLERK: Starting your own pharmacy?\nCHARLIE: [grunts] [gasping]\n[man speaking backwards]\nNINA: You found another one.\nOLIVIA: Peter says this device is streaming loads of data, and he believes it's possible that these devices store a pattern of their last victim.\nNINA: Our scientists have the same theory. In fact, they thought they might be able to extract an image. They also theorize each device is tuned to a specific user, which suggests that since the shape-changer that tried to kill you no longer has his device, he's trapped in his current body. Our scientists have been working on revealing that shape-shifter's identity, but what with all the damage to the other unit --\nOLIVIA: Well, this one is intact.\nNINA: Then let's take a look, shall we?\nNINA: So can you fix it?\nBRANDON: Do you understand you're asking me if I can repair a piece of technology that is entirely unlike anything that has ever existed here on Earth?\nNINA: Brandon --\nBRANDON: Now that I have one that works, I can do it in three hours... tops.\nNINA: Good, then get started right away.\nBRANDON: Yes ma'am.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so I'm gonna head back to Boston. Will you call me if he gets it working?\nBRANDON: Oh, I can do better than that. I can set up a rendering program and patch you in... in real time. If you want, you can see it all for yourself. A computer, from your cell phone, I can log you into our server.\nNINA: Ahem.\nBRANDON: The public one. The public server, of course... if it's okay with you.\nPETER: Nice house.\nWALTER: Yes, it's lovely. Rebecca always had fine taste. Do you think she'll remember me?\nPETER: [chuckles] I think she might. I'm gonna guess there's not too many men in her life who have strapped her to a table and pumped her full of a massive amount of psychedelics.\nPETER: Walter, you didn't--\nWALTER: What, son?\nPETER: Uh, nothing. [knocking at door]\nWALTER: Peter, wait. Could you do the talking? Please, son.\nPETER: Sure. Ms. Kibner? Hi. I'm Peter Bishop.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Walter? Is it you?\nWALTER: Hello, Rebecca.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Oh, my God. Hello.\nWALTER: Hi.\nREBECCA KIBNER: At first, I assumed it was all just a figment of my imagination and the L.S.D., of course. But after a while, it wasn't just during the experiments. I would see their faces in front of me. They seemed to have, I don't know, a certain glow about them.\nPETER: The shape-shifters?\nREBECCA KIBNER: Mm-hmm. It -- it took me a year or two to really understand it. But I realized that... I was recognizing people that didn't belong. You know, like that children's song -- \"one of these things is not like the others.\"\nWALTER: \"one of these things is not like the others. One of these things just doesn't belong.\" Sesame street.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Yes, that's it.\nWALTER: Our experiment triggered an ability to see beyond the limits of your vision.\nREBECCA KIBNER: You gave me a great gift, Walter. You, uh... opened my mind for a time. In fact, I even tried to look you up about ten years ago, tried to contact Harvard, but no one knew where you were or how to reach you.\nWALTER: I was--\nPETER: Travelling. My father was travelling. Ms. Kibner, you said 'for a time'. Does that mean that the ability has faded?\nREBECCA KIBNER: Not entirely, no. Comes and goes as it pleases. I just have memories.\nPETER: These people -- the shape-shifters -- we have reason to believe that some of them are amongst us right now. We were hoping that you might be able to help us identify them.\nREBECCA KIBNER: I told you, it's -- it's mostly gone.\nWALTER: What if you could get it back -- your ability?\nREBECCA KIBNER: You mean do the experiment again?\nWALTER: Which I must advise against. Anytime one exposes one's brain to that amount of hallucinogens--\nREBECCA KIBNER: Yeah, sure. I'll help you.\n[Walter jams to classic rock]\nPETER: Just a couple more.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Actually, that one goes more on my temple.\nPETER: You're an old pro at this, huh?\nREBECCA KIBNER: Drug-infused mystical awakenings, guided by your father, aren't exactly something you can forget.\nOLIVIA: Hi. Uh, I'm Agent Olivia Dunham.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Rebecca.\nOLIVIA: Thank you so much for doing this.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Sure.\nASTRID: Walter, you said you wanted to start her with Salvia. We don't have any Salvia.\nWALTER: Huh?\nREBECCA KIBNER: You used to... um, in that cabinet on the second shelf, over on the right.\n[bottles clanking]\nASTRID: Got it.\nWALTER: Ah. Oh. I don't suppose you recall where I left my slippers.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me. Astrid, can you do me a favor? Do you think you could log onto this site from your computer?\nASTRID: Massive Dynamic. This looks like their secure FTP.\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nASTRID: Sure thing.\nWALTER: This is the first of the psychedelics. Ready to begin?\nREBECCA KIBNER: I think I've been ready for the past ten years.\nWALTER: Okay.\nPETER: It's working. The tech must be rebuilding the image from the broken device.\nASTRID: It looks like a department store mannequin.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Now let's just load it up on my phone.\nWALTER: When Belly and I first did this, we prepped her for thirty-six hours. But I'm thinking... for this type of spatial disorientation, we can reduce it to a few moments.\nPETER: Isn't that dangerous?\nWALTER: More than injecting her with substantial amounts of untested, homemade psychoactive drugs? Astrid... get me three syringes of Phenothiazine. It's on the top shelf, under \"a\" for \"antipsychotics.\" And two vials of Valium... just to be safe.\nPETER: Ready?\nWALTER: Yes, son.\nPETER: I want you to tell me if this starts to get uncomfortable, okay?\nREBECCA KIBNER: Thank you. I met you once before. You were just a baby, but... I swore I saw... Ohh! Ohh, here we go!\nPETER: I think we're ready, Walter. [breathing deeply]\nWALTER: Rebecca, focus on my voice.\nREBECCA KIBNER: What?\nWALTER: Concentrate on the people who don't belong.\nREBECCA KIBNER: You mean... the ones that change their appearance? [gasping]\nWALTER: There's no need to be afraid. You can see them...\nASTRID: Hey, Peter.\nWALTER: ...but they can't see you.\n[Rebecca panting, whimpering]\nWALTER: Listen to my voice. I'm going to take you over the threshold. We're walking through Johnston Gate into Harvard Yard. Can you see it? It's Autumn, and it's late. The leaves crunch under our feet. Past the statue of John Harvard.\nREBECCA KIBNER: [breathing heavily]\nWALTER: Now we're passing University Hall... Memorial Church is up ahead.\nREBECCA KIBNER: [groans]\nWALTER: Ring. [bell dings]\nPETER: Walter! Hey, Walter. Olivia. Olivia! Olivia!\nWILLIAM BELL: Olivia. After all these years... it is so nice to finally see you again.\nWILLIAM BELL: You'll have to forgive me. The method by which I brought you over here was crude, and I'm sorry for that, but there were people who were trying to prevent our meeting. This is not at all the kind of reunion I had always envisioned.\nOLIVIA: The reunion that you had envisioned? Doctor Bell, I have been trying to meet with you for over a year.\nWILLIAM BELL: Please, call me William... or Willam - if that feels warmer to you. Willam -- that's what you always called me when you were a girl. How do you like your tea?\nOLIVIA: I don't want any tea. I want answers. [rumbling]\nWILLIAM BELL: [laughs] You're still a little disoriented from the time slips, aren't you? Happened to me when I first came here. You're -- you're out of sync with this side. You're lucky. Most people who cross dimensions, without your natural talent, are simply torn apart.\nOLIVIA: Well, 'lucky' isn't the word that I would choose. [rumbling] [gas hissing] [breathing deeply]\nWILLIAM BELL: Ahh. I don't know how much Walter's told you by now. I don't know how much he remembers.\nOLIVIA: He told me what you two did to me when I was just a girl... how you conducted drug trials on young children.\nWILLIAM BELL: We weren't trying to hurt you, Olivia. We weren't trying to hurt anybody.\nOLIVIA: Hey, guess what? [chuckles] You did. I've met some of the others. To say that they are permanently damaged would be an understatement.\nWILLIAM BELL: Yes. In any search for knowledge, there are always unintended consequences -- victims, you might say. But not you. I can see that... just by looking at you. In fact, you're just coming into your ability. [rumbling] [echoing] I've seen history repeat itself enough times to know a war is coming, just as we predicted, Walter and I, years ago, and we knew that we had to prepare a guardian, someone to watch the gate.\nOLIVIA: The gate?\nWILLIAM BELL: Between this side and yours. I would like to say 'ours', because that's where I came from, but I'm afraid I would sound disingenuous.\nOLIVIA: Go on.\nWILLIAM BELL: For reasons that will become clear in time, I cannot go back yet, maybe not ever. But now we know how difficult it is to cross over. I can count on my hand the number of people who've done it safely. But on this side, they've become more insidious. They have designed hybrids -- part organic tissue, part machine -- that can do things that humans can't. They can change shapes, taking the form of human beings. Over here, they call them 'the first wave'.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that these hybrids are already on our side.\nWILLIAM BELL: I know it's difficult to grasp.\nOLIVIA: Oh, I can grasp it just fine. I don't trust you, Doctor Bell... or William, or... Willam... or whatever cutesy name you think might appeal to my childhood instincts. It won't. Your company has been involved in, if not directly responsible for, some of the most horrific things that I have ever seen, to say nothing of the fact that you just yanked me into a parallel universe to warn me about an inter-dimensional war that I believe you are responsible for starting. So what I want is not warmth, or tea. It's the truth.\nWILLIAM BELL: The truth will come out. It always does. Livvy, you don't have to trust me. You don't even have to like me, but you can't deny I have a unique perspective, shaped by having lived in two worlds. I know the difference a wrong choice can make... or a right one. For example, this building is still standing because different choices were made. So, Livvy, if you can look past your anger, you may find that I am more of an ally than you think. [rumbling] [voices echoing] A storm is coming, perhaps the last and worst storm of all. And when it is over, I fear there will be little left of our world. The shape-shifters on your side are looking for someone, someone to open the door between universes, and if they find him, there will be no stopping them, and that is why you must find him first.\nOLIVIA: Me?\nWILLIAM BELL: You are the one, Olivia. Of all the children that Walter and I prepared, you were the strongest. You were always the strongest. [rumbling] Remember this symbol. It's hidden on their leader. That's how you'll know him. [echoing] Show this to Nina Sharp. [rumbling] She can help you. We're out of time. [bell dings] Olivia. [echoing voices] [rumbling]\nPETER: Olivia. Olivia. Olivia! Can you hear me?\nWALTER: Astrid, Nitroglycerine, thirty C.C.s. Peter, turn the head to the side, make sure she can breathe.\nPETER: Walter, what's happening?\nWALTER: I think she's receiving a flood of memories. Could be too much, too fast. [bell dings]\nWILLIAM BELL: You should stand. I think it'll be less painful that way.\nOLIVIA: What will?\nWILLIAM BELL: And remember this -- Einai kalytero... Anthropo apo toy... Patera toy. Tell that to Peter. You're going to need him by your side. Tell it to him. He'll know what it means. [rumbling]\nWALTER: We have to shock her heart. There's a vial of adrenaline, Peter.\nWILLIAM BELL: And I'm afraid there's no avoiding what has to happen next. I pulled you out of a moving car. Momentum can be deferred, but it must always be paid back, in full. [rumbling]\nWALTER: Okay. Into her heart - between the ribs. Count to three -- one, two...\nWILLIAM BELL: As I once said to Walter, physics is a bitch.\nWALTER: Three!\nPETER: Sorry, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: [gasping, groaning in pain] I need to speak to Nina Sharp!\nNINA: Nina Sharp.\nOLIVIA: Nina, we need to talk.\nNINA: Olivia?\nOLIVIA: Look, I'm on my way there now.\nNINA: I'm sorry. I'm just about to leave for Hong Kong.\nOLIVIA: I have a message from William Bell.\nNINA: (to her assistant) Cancel the plane.\nREBECCA KIBNER: I wish I could have been more of a help to you.\nPETER: Oh, you did great. You sure you're alright to drive?\nWALTER: Oh, she's fine. The injections I gave her would have counteracted any hallucinogenics in her system. Peter.\nPETER: Yeah?\nWALTER: I think I'd like to drive home with her.\nPETER: You just said that all the drugs were out of her system. How are you gonna get back home, Walter?\nWALTER: The bus.\nPETER: Okay.\nWALTER: Peter I need some money. (To Rebecca) He said okay.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Terrific.\nPETER: It was a pleasure meeting you.\nREBECCA KIBNER: You too, Peter. Say good-bye to Agent Dunham for me, will you?\nPETER: What?\nREBECCA KIBNER: Oh, nothing. I... [sighs] I'm sorry. It's probably just the drugs.\nASTRID: Hey.\nCHARLIE: Where is everyone?\nASTRID: Uh, Peter and Doctor Bishop are out, and Olivia went to New York to see Nina Sharp. I can call her if you want me to. She just left a few minutes --\nCHARLIE: No, that's okay. I'll talk to her when she gets back. What is this?\nASTRID: Oh, that's Massive Dynamic. They're rebuilding the image from the broken device.\nNINA: Doctor Bell showed you this?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Have you ever seen that before -- that symbol?\nNINA: No.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's what he told me. He said it would be hidden somewhere on their leader's body.\nNINA: Well, then I suspect it would be on his head, assuming that's what the cryogenic hijackings are about. And that's all Doctor Bell told you?\nOLIVIA: He said that the man with that mark... would try to open a door between our two worlds... that a storm was coming, and that the only way to stop it would be for me to find him before the shape-shifters did.\nNINA: A storm?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. What?\nNINA: It was a phrase he used. When Doctor Bell realized the existence of the other side, the thing he dreaded most was the inevitable collision... if our two universes ever came together.\nOLIVIA: Collision?\nNINA: The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time. Doctor Bell was afraid that if the doorway between the two sides was ever opened... that the unavoidable conclusion... only one world would remain. It's what he called the last great storm.\n[high-pitched tone, rumbling]\nWILLIAM BELL: Laston-Hennings Cryonics.\n[cell phone rings]\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. I have to go.\nNINA: Olivia? Whatever Massive Dynamic can do to help find this man, we are at your service.\n[thunder rumbling]\nOLIVIA: How'd you know?\nCHARLIE: Listen to me carefully. My car's around the corner, we got a S.W.A.T. team inbound. As soon as I verify you're out of this building, they're gonna shred this place. Let's move.\nOLIVIA: Oh, God, Charlie, I almost told her everything. I got to call Broyles.\nCHARLIE: What do you mean \"almost\"?\nOLIVIA: Well, I just realized where it is, the head that they're looking for. Bell told me. It's at Laston-Hennings Cryonics.\n[ringing] (Olivia looks at her phone and sees a reconstruction of Charlie as the shape shifter.)\nOLIVIA: Ohh! Ohh! [coughing] Ohh! Ugh! Ugh!\nCHARLIE: [on cellphone] It's me. Laston-Hennings Cryonics.\nOLIVIA: Ohh! Ohh! [coughing] Ohh! Ugh! Ugh!\n[gunshot]\nPASSERBY: What are you doing? [gunshot] [gunshot]\n[gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot]\nREBECCA KIBNER: Won't you come in?\nWALTER: I don't think I should. The bus leaves every half hour, and... oh, I only have fourteen minutes to walk to the stop.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Some day, huh? [laughs] Not at all what I expected when I woke up this morning.\nWALTER: That's the way of things... the best days and the worst days rarely are. Rebecca, what I did to you -- it was wrong.\nREBECCA KIBNER: Oh, Walter.\nWALTER: No, no. You were young, and I took advantage, and...\nREBECCA KIBNER: (kisses him gently) I've wanted to do that for so long. Oh, Walter, what you did -- you made me... Special.\nWALTER: The truth is... I believe you were always special. I must go... under 12 minutes.\nBROYLES: You had no choice. If you didn't kill him, he would have killed you. It's not your fault. Whatever that thing was, it wasn't Charlie.\nOLIVIA: They killed him for what? To open a door to the other side? And who are these people, and what do they want? What did we do to them?\nBROYLES: Laston-Hennings Cryonics was hit 15 minutes before our protective detail arrived. They took everything. All the cryo-capsules are gone.\nOLIVIA: So they found who they were looking for.\nBROYLES: I assume so.\nOLIVIA: William Bell pulled me to another universe to give me a warning. That's how important this is. And I failed.\nBROYLES: Olivia, we'll find them.\n(Smith continues the crewcuts for the frozen skulls. a skull is found with the telling symbol. thawed, it has been attached to a mechanical body. the eyes open)"

I got my memories back from the accident, so... I figured I wouldn't be needing these. (places her bowling shoes on the counter)\nSAM WEISS: (studies her face for a few seconds) Who died? (they move to the seats near a lane) You and your partner, Charlie, were pretty close, huh?\nOLIVIA: (nods yes)\nSAM WEISS: I guess getting your memory back wasn't your only problem?\nOLIVIA: Oh, of course I have problems, but... the problems I have I can handle.\nSAM WEISS: I'm sure you can. You know, if you ask me, what you need right now, Agent Dunham, is something to help you with everything you've been going through... something to help you... make sense of it all.\nOLIVIA: Like bowling?\nSAM WEISS: Well, what do you know? She makes a joke. (both smile) No, I got another project for you. But yes, like bowling. You're gonna think I'm full of it, but here's the thing, Olivia, whether you admit it or not, your life is something of a nightmare. I hope you don't have anything against the colorred. (puts a piece of note paper on the table for her)\n(Langdon & Rob Law Firm. 3:34 PM and Greg is late. as he finds his way from the elevator, thru the cubicles to the meeting room, he has terrible hallucinations that most of his associates are evil demonic beings)\nCO-WORKER: Jeez, Greg. Carl's really pissed off at you. What, uh -- what'd you do, man? You better get in there.\nGREG LEITER: I'm going.\nSECRETARY: (intercepting Greg at the conference room door) Finally. We've been waiting. Are you okay?\nCARL LANGDON: (as Greg enters) Leiter! Do you know how much trouble you caused me? (in full demonic face to Greg) I am going to destroy you!\n(Greg goes to town on Carl... smashing his face with his silver Halliburton briefcase - repeatedly)\nCO-WORKERS: What the hell? (pulling Greg from his murderous act) What are you - crazy? Stop it! (Greg's eyes flitter back and forth very rapidly)\n(having found new living quarters, the Bishop Boys are busy with boxes, movers, and in Walter's case - pillows)\nWALTER: (to a mover) You can bring that in here, please.\nPETER: (to the mover) Hang on. (to his father) Walter, what are you doing?\nWALTER: (setting-up camp in the middle of the family room) Making my bed. I've got a fireplace to keep me warm, and if I get hungry in the middle of the night, the kitchen is only thirteen steps away, which is a prime number and a sign of good fortune.\nPETER: You know that you have a bedroom, right? Upstairs.\nWALTER: Oh, I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, son. I promise to wear my shorts to bed so that if you bring any young ladies home there won't be any embarrassing moments.\nASTRID: (coming in from outside with gifts) Knock, knock.\nWALTER: Agent Farnsworth. Welcome to our new home.\nASTRID: Thank you.\nWALTER: Oh. Oh, housewarming. I love presents.\nASTRID: (to Peter) Hey.\nPETER: (to his father who has his face buried in a gift) Oh. Walter, come on.\nWALTER: (guessing) Italian ciabatta bread.\nASTRID: Very impressive, Walter.\nWALTER: Yes!\nASTRID: It's for good luck. (to Peter) I brought something for you too.\nPETER: Oh, you shouldn't have.\nASTRID: Agent Dunham sent this over. A man kills his boss, he doesn't remember, and then he has this really crazy thing with his eyes.\nPETER: (reads the file she handed him) This says there's video surveillance.\nASTRID: I saw it. Whatever was happening to that man, it wasn't normal.\nWALTER: Do I eat it or keep it?\nASTRID: I suppose whichever you'd like.\nPETER: Pack a bag, Walter. We're going to Seattle.\n(the science trio pulls up to the front of a large hospital in a taxicab, and gets out)\nPETER: (to the driver as he retrieves bags from the trunk) Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (paying the driver) There you go. Do you have a card? In case we need a ride while we're in town. (takes a business card) Thank you.\n(inside the hospital, walking the corridors to the restrained Leiter)\nDETECTIVE GREEN: Thanks for coming out. We brought Mister Leiter here around six last night. We haven't managed to get anything out of him.\nOLIVIA: He hasn't been cooperative?\nDETECTIVE GREEN: He hasn't been responsive. We only just managed to wake him up.\nPETER: Wait. He's been asleep for sixteen hours?\nDETECTIVE GREEN: Like he was drugged. The doctors only managed to wake him up a few minutes ago.\nWALTER: (nervously, at the observation window) Peter, I - I don't want to go in there. I'd rather stay out here.\nPETER: Sure.\n(bedside with the seemingly rational Leiter)\nOLIVIA: Can you tell us what happened, Mister Leiter?\nGREG LEITER: It doesn't make sense. I remember driving to work from lunch, pulling into the garage, and then I was on the floor in Carl Langdon's office. They were holding me down.\nOLIVIA: And there's nothing else that you remember from yesterday? Nothing unusual?\nGREG LEITER: You're gonna think I'm crazy.\nOLIVIA: Try me.\nGREG LEITER: The office... it was like the office Was infiltrated by these creatures. And Carl, he was their leader. (more agitated) He had horns... like some demon. I know. It sounds nuts. Almost like I'm dreaming, or like it was...\nOLIVIA: Mister Leiter? (as he fights at his restraints) Mister Leiter?\nPETER: Walter.\nDETECTIVE GREEN: What is it? (as everyone watching rushes into the room)\nJILL LEITER: Greg!\nATTENDANT: You can't go in the room missus..\nJILL LEITER: Greg! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (panicked)\nDETECTIVE GREEN: Mrs. Leiter.\nJILL LEITER: No, Greg! No! No! (as he dies, instantly graying in the process)\nWALTER: (inspecting Leiter's corpse in the hospital) That's odd. He's warm. He should be cooler by now. (distracted) The oven -- Peter, I think we forgot to turn it off at home.\nPETER: Walter, we've never even turned it on.\nWALTER: Are you sure? (getting worried)\nPETER: Walter, we never turned the oven on. We did not leave the front door unlocked, and the toaster is not gonna burn the house down - what's going on with you, Walter? You've been acting weird ever since we got here.\nSHAYNE WILSON: (entering the lab) Apologies, we're still waiting on the tox screen. But the blood C.B.C. is, uh...\nWALTER: ... severe thyroxine deficit, curiously high levels of adrenal hormones.\nSHAYNE WILSON: How did you know that?\nWALTER: Um um, Shock-induced achromotrichia, hyperkeratotic skin lesions, and clear signs of dehydration. (pointing to portions of the corpse) It seems that this man died of -- of acute exhaustion.\nSHAYNE WILSON: That doesn't make any sense. Human beings can't die of...\nWALTER: ...not that we're aware of, no. It has been documented in rats. (resolutely) I need this body taken back to my lab.\nSHAYNE WILSON: Your lab?\nWALTER: In Boston, Massachusetts.\nPETER: (intervening) Walter, whatever you need, I'm sure they have it here.\nWALTER: Would you excuse me, Doctor? (walks over to his son, insecure) Peter, I - I need to go home. I don't like it here.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: This city - has a smell.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: It's wet! (nervous) It reminds me of Saint Claire's, the mental institution where I lived. Peter, I want to go home. You stay. Help Agent Dunham, but, but...\nPETER: ...okay. We'll find someone to take you home.\nWALTER: (quite grateful) Thank you.\nPETER: (watching as Walter supervises the med techs loading Leiter for the trip to the airport) Seems pretty harmless. Looks can be deceiving.\nAGENT KASHNER: Buddy, I've been with The Bureau for three years. Flying your father home shouldn't be a problem.\nPETER: Right. You'll want to keep his Sudoku pad handy. There's also a copy of Max Planck's book on entropy in his backpack. That should keep him busy for a couple hours. And whatever you do, under no circumstances let him drink.\nAGENT KASHNER: Bit of a tippler, huh? (jokingly)\nPETER: (seriously) No, at any given time, there's a good chance there's about a half dozen psychotropic drugs in his system, so drinking -- it's not a good idea.\nOLIVIA: (joining the team on the loading dock) Thank you, Doctor. You know, I really appreciate your cooperation.\nSHAYNE WILSON: Yeah, no problem.\nOLIVIA: Do you have a business card? So that I - I can send you a copy of the results.\nSHAYNE WILSON: Uh, of course.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. (joins Peter)\nWALTER: (chiding the med techs at the ambulance) No! You can't put the body in feet first. Lunatics. Out, out. (barking)\nPETER: (privately to Olivia) You think he'll be alright?\nOLIVIA: (grinning) Walter or Agent Kashner?\n(sitting quietly in her front room)\nJILL LEITER: (somberly) Greg used to call me every day after lunch. When he didn't call, I knew that something was wrong.\nOLIVIA: But there'd... there had been no change in his behavior recently?\nJILL LEITER: He was a little more tired than usual, but he'd been working a lot.\nOLIVIA: But no illnesses? No hallucinations?\nJILL LEITER: No, not at all. I can't believe he's gone. (tearful)\nPETER: (snooping around the room) Mrs. Leiter... did your husband have any sleep issues? (pointing)These books -- guide to sleep disorders, understanding sleep?...\nJILL LEITER: He used to sleepwalk. Sometimes he'd wake-up in the kitchen having cooked a whole meal.\nOLIVIA: Was he ever violent?\nJILL LEITER: No. No, never. And he was cured. He had seen a few specialists. He hadn't had an episode in six months.\nOLIVIA: Uh, we'll need the names of those doctors.\nPETER: And did he by any chance keep a sleep journal?\nJILL LEITER: Yeah. Would you like to see it?\nPETER: Yes. Please.\nWALTER: Just in time, dear. Help me with this infernal body bag.\nAGENT KASHNER: (on cell phone in background) This is Agent Kashner.\nASTRID: Walter, it's almost Midnight.\nAGENT KASHNER: Yes, I'll hold.\nWALTER: The ride back was invigorating. (excited) The turbulence over Ohio was like being in the belly of a seizing whale. I screamed like a little girl.\nASTRID: I'm sure that went over well with the rest of the passengers.\nAGENT KASHNER: (phone argument) No, it's Bishop. B-I-S-H-O-P. Yes, we got the body.\nASTRID: What's that about?\nWALTER: They detained our bags.\nAGENT KASHNER: Raw milk? No, I'm pretty sure Doctor Bishop wouldn't have packed a bottle of raw...\nGENE: Moo.\nAGENT KASHNER: ... milk. Yes, I understand it's against the law. I'm a federal agent.\nWALTER: (quietly with Astrid) That's odd -- nine stitches... (on Leiter's neck) Surgical. There's no reason for an incision there. Astricks, my small bone saw, please.\nASTRID: Astrid!\nWALTER: Yes?\nAGENT KASHNER: Doctor Bishop, I - I'm sorry, but, uh, those bags won't be available to us until morning.\nWALTER: That's okay. In fact, you can assist us in removing his scalp. (Kashner raises his eyebrows) Once you get used to the smell, it's really quite something. Come on.\n(he has been reading the sleep journal and knocks on her door to talk about it)\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: I didn't wake you, did I? (shakes her head no and shows him her toothbrush. he enters. she closes the door and stares at his M.I.T. t-shirt) What?\nOLIVIA: Cute. Except in my case, I actually graduated. (referencing her Northwestern t-shirt) I'm guessing, uh, you bought yours to impress the girls. (puts toothbrush away)\nPETER: (candidly) Yeah, more or less.\nOLIVIA: So what you got?\nPETER: (hands her the journal and they sit) Greg Leiter's sleep journal. His wife was right. For the last couple months, he's been averaging between eight and ten hours of sleep every night.\nOLIVIA: Then how can he die of exhaustion?\nPETER: It gets weirder. He was also using it as a dream diary. Guess what his nightmares were about.\nOLIVIA: Demons?\nPETER: Yeah. At least once a week. Then a couple months ago, all of a sudden, they stop.\nOLIVIA: So do you think this is some kind of extreme sleepwalking?\nPETER: No, sleepwalkers don't generally get violent. And unlike Greg Leiter, they don't remember their experiences.\nOLIVIA: (coy) Where'd you learn that? M.I.T.?\nPETER: As a kid, I used to get these terrible nightmares, almost every night. So I know a thing or two about dreaming.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. That must have been awful.\nPETER: Actually, it was one of the rare occasions in my childhood that walter was helpful. He taught me to condition myself. Every night before I went to sleep I had to say a mantra in my head. \"Please don't dream tonight. Please don't dream tonight. Please don't dream tonight.\"\nOLIVIA: Did that work?\nPETER: Well, you can't stop yourself from dreaming, but it did make it so that I didn't remember. From the age of eight to almost nineteen... don't remember a single dream. No more nightmares.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone and listens. then tells Peter) There's been another incident.\n(on the dark, wet streets, law enforcement is securing a crash scene between an automobile and a motorcycle)\nOBSERVING OFFICER: The guy on the bike was dead on impact. The woman must have been driving forty miles per hour when she...\nOTHER OFFICER: Crash killed her too..\nOBSERVING OFFICER: She's dead, but it wasn't from the crash.\nROB ROSIELLO: (talking to Olivia as his wife is loaded on a gurney in an open body bag) Ellen was calling to let me know she was heading home from the office. We were on the phone when she... she said she saw a monster. Did -- did you see her white hair? What happened to her?\nWALTER: (to the helpful agent) Hold it steady, Agent Casper.\nAGENT KASHNER: (to Walter) It's Kashner. (to Astrid) Do this kind of thing often?\nASTRID: Brains? No. Although Walter gets particularly excited whenever we do.\nWALTER: Hmm. Look at that. (softly to Astrid) Would you call Peter?\nAGENT KASHNER: (as Walter pulls a small transmitter from the corpse's brain) Ugh. I'm out.\nASTRID: (on phone to Peter at crash scene) Hey, I've got Walter for you.\nPETER: (to Astrid on the phone) A filament? What kind of filament? Hold on a second, fellas. (stopping the coroners team) Mind if I take a look at her? (opens the body bag)\nWALTER: (studies the electronic component) Some kind of little computer chip embedded in his midbrain.\nPETER: (supposing) The thalamus?\nWALTER: Yes, that would make sense. Well done, son.\nPETER: Hold up, Walter. Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: (to Rosiello) Excuse me.\nASTRID: (to Walter) What does that do -- the thalamus? Why is it relevant?\nWALTER: It's the part of the brain that regulates sleep.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter as he inspects the crash victim) What are you looking for?\nPETER: That. (exposing an inch long scar on the neckline of the corpse)\nBROYLES: Both victims have been surgically implanted.\nNINA: It's a bio-chip. Technically a brain-computer interface, or B.C.I. This particular chip has a transmitter, which makes it wireless.\nBROYLES: (inspecting the recovered implant) So it can commit the brain to a remote computer?\nNINA: That's right. From what we can ascertain, we think it works a lot like a pacemaker. It monitors sleep cycles and, when necessary, stimulates the thalamus, which induces a deeper sleep state. There is a researcher in Seattle who has worked on several prototypes like it. The man is a genius. We've been tracking him for years.\nBROYLES: (inspects her file on Doctor Nayak) Thank you. I'll let the team know. (stands up to depart)\nOLIVIA: (as he opens his front door) Doctor Laxmeesh Nayak? I'm Olivia Dunham. I'm with the F.B.I. (hands him photos) We were wondering if you were familiar with Greg Leiter and Ellen Rosiello.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: Yes, they're patients. (very concerned) What's this about?\nOLIVIA: (monotone) Both of them recently committed homicidal attacks and then died, as a result of what appears to be extreme exhaustion.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: Oh, God. (dismayed)\nOLIVIA: Doctor Nayak, we found a bio-chip imbedded in Mister Leiter's brain. Do you know...\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: ...yes. Yes, of course. They both had them. They were part of a study.\nPETER: So you've implanted those chips into other people?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (still surprised) It's a large-scale, clinical trial. There are sixty in the control group and eighty-two with the bio-chips.\nOLIVIA: We're gonna need their names, all of them.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (walking up stairs to his office) I've been working on this chip for years. I've tested it extensively.\nPETER: And there's no malfunction that could have caused the kind of reaction we saw? What if the chip shorted out?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: Even if it had, the chip should have remained benign. (approaching his ransacked office) Why is this...?\nPETER: (to Nayak) Wait here. (outside his office)\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (entering his office anyway) The main computer server. It contained all my research -- the patients' files. (looking around) It's all gone. (to Olivia, later as crime scene investigators inspect) The patients' files are backed-up on a remote server. I'll give you the password. (writes on note pad)\nZACH MILLER: (entering the office with a police escort) Doctor Nayak?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (to Olivia) My research assistant. (to Zach) Zach, call the nurses. We need the names of all the patients. Everyone they can remember.\nZACH MILLER: Sure. (hesitantly) Uh, I - I'll get right on it.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (to Olivia) The password. (gives her the handwritten note)\nOLIVIA: Thank you. Doctor Nayak, can you think of anyone who would want to steal your data... or might want to sabotage you?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: I - I don't know. I - I suppose there are any number of companies.\nOLIVIA: The chip was valuable?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: Oh, the initial testing has been remarkable. It's cured sleepwalking, night terrors... all the major non-R.E.M. sleep disorders. These people just wanted some rest, and my chip was helping them. It wouldn't make them hurt anyone, and it certainly wouldn't kill them. It just doesn't make any sense. (weight of world on his shoulders)\nOLIVIA: Doctor Nayak, do you have a business card? Just for our records.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: I'll get you one. (walks into an adjacent room)\nOLIVIA: (joins Peter nearby) Well, the doctor is beside himself. And aside from the obvious, which is money, he can't think of any reason why someone would want to steal his research.\nPETER: I can. The bio-chip plugs directly into the thalamus, which not only regulates sleep, it also works as a relay tower to the Cerebral Cortex, which also controls motor-function.\nWALTER: (in his lab, on the phone) Mind control, Peter. Wouldn't be the first time someone's attempted it. I told you about my work with the MK-Ultra Project. Of course, at that time, we supposed we could do it with L.S.D. and hypnotic suggestion.\nPETER: (walking out of a Seattle neighborhood grocer, as he steals some fruit) So it is possible?\nWALTER: Theoretically, yes.\nPETER: If I faxed you a schematic of the device's internal architecture, could you test the chip you have?\nWALTER: Yes, but I'd need to replicate the chip's function in a neutral environment. Of course, I - if I had a live subject...\nPETER: Walter, no. No student volunteers. (almost scolding)\nAGENT KASHNER: (returning to the lab with the detained luggage) Good news -- the bags are back.\nPETER: Walter. Walter. Walter. Say it! -- \"no students.\"\nWALTER: Alright, no students.\nOLIVIA: (on her cell phone) Okay, well, get back to me as soon as you can.\nPETER: (returning with lunch) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey. So, uh, did you reach Walter? (he sits with her and places the food down)\nPETER: Yeah. He thinks it could be mind control, but modifying the bio-chips would take a lot of trial and error.\nOLIVIA: So he thinks that someone's trying to perfect mind control one patient at a time? Well, that would explain why the events are seemingly without motive.\nPETER: Yeah. How's the patient roundup going?\nOLIVIA: Nayak could only list twenty-six patients. (reviews a handwritten list) So the local P.D. are taking them in to his clinic and removing their chips, so to speak.\nPETER: That still leaves, what? Fifty-odd patients. (as she studies a photo of Charlie, he sees her sadden) Listen... Olivia, I think I understand what it is that you're going through, but that thing that you killed... that wasn't Charlie.\nOLIVIA: I know. It's just, I -- you know, my first week on the job, I was on a sting operation. These Irish thugs were smuggling guns and -- and cocaine. And I had been a military prosecutor, so I hadn't handled a gun since basic training. And suddenly, I'm underground in this garage, wearing a bulletproof vest and -- and wondering how the hell I got there. So I did what any rookie would do, and I started looking for an exit. And then Charlie walks over. This man that I didn't know -- this gruff guy. And... he said... \"you're gonna be fine.\" (remembering fondly) ...and, um, I have to face it... that he... he's gone... and that he's not coming back. (tearful) So I'm just gonna go to Nayak's clinic and -- and see if I can help the nurse identify some other patients.\nPETER: Okay.\n(in a dark room in Doctor Nayak's house, a man wears a skull cap with many electrodes and types computer commands in front of several monitors. tapped into Nayak Sleep Clinic files, an image of a young restaurant server appears)\nDIANE LAMIA: (to her father in a busy commercial kitchen) That was a double order on Table Nine, Pop.\nMISTER LAMIA: (proudly) So what'd your friends think of my moussaka?\nDIANE LAMIA: (conceding) Like they'd died and gone to Heaven.\nMISTER LAMIA: (smartly) You're damn right! (his daughter smiles)\nZACH MILLER: (in the darkened room, to the dark figure behind the monitors) Do you really want to increase the dose?\n(the cryptic man pushes the control toggles to maximum. Diane continues her kitchen activities... but now she seems affected. her remote controller reels back as she becomes disoriented. she grabs the back of her skull, the grill chef seems unusual to her. he is serving-up grilled human forearms. as affairs in her mind become more bizarre, her controller seems more satisfied. she takes matters into her own hands - drawing a chef's knife and proceeding to the grill station - ready to attack)\n(Walter works and whistles alone - preparing a beaker, when he is rejoined)\nAGENT KASHNER: (walking in with his gear) Doctor Bishop, I'm heading to the airport, back to Seattle. Would you say good-bye to Agent Farnsworth for me?\nWALTER: Certainly. Oh, before you go, could you do me a favor and smell this? It seems my olfactory sense is a bit muddled. Must be the French roast coffee I had for breakfast. (holds out the beaker for sniffing)\nAGENT KASHNER: (unsuspecting) Raspberry? (uncertain about the aroma... then a hard drop to the floor - totally unconscious. Walter continues whistling)\n(in a well-lit operating room, to his assistant)\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (extracts a transmitter from a patient, then directs his assistant) Keep Miss Barage sedated for another ten minutes. Then bring in my next patient.\n(standing outside of Nayak's office on the second level, Olivia overlooks the growing crowd of upset sleep clinic patients. she turns to a clinic employee and suggests)\nOLIVIA: We should contact the local pharmacies too. They should be able to identify who's filled a prescription within the last six months from Doctor Nayak. (answers her ringing phone) Excuse me. Hello?\nSAM WEISS: (from the bowels of a pin resetting device in his bowling alley) What's shakin', Bacon?\nOLIVIA: (curtly, with humor) Oh, the usual -- I'm just painting my toenails and planning on taking a trip up the coast.\nSAM WEISS: You get the business cards?\nOLIVIA: Uh, yeah. I got, uh -- I got eight of them. (she sits alone in the clinic)\nSAM WEISS: Eight? You asked everyone you saw wearing red?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. So what do I do now?\nSAM WEISS: Lay them out in front of you like you're playing go fish. Take a pen, circle one letter in every name, both first and last. (she does so) When you're finished, take all the letters you've circled and write them down on a piece of paper. Got it?\nOLIVIA: (starts writing in her note pad) Okay. Now what?\nSAM WEISS: Now Jumble.\nOLIVIA: Jumble?\nSAM WEISS: Jumble. Anagram. Word Puzzle. Find the phrase.\nOLIVIA: What phrase? What -- what am I looking for?\nSAM WEISS: Whatever it is you need to hear. You'll figure it out. Gotta go. (he hangs up)\nOLIVIA: (cell phone rings, expecting Sam) You know, I really don't have any time for this.\nBROYLES: Dunham.\nOLIVIA: (slightly embarrassed) Agent Broyles?\nBROYLES: Nayak's patient files are gone. The server at the data-storage facility was wiped some time within the last twenty-four hours.\nOLIVIA: Can we trace the hacker's I.P. Address?\nBROYLES: We don't think there was one. There's no sign of a D.D.O.S. attack, and given the level of on-line security in the facility, we think whoever wiped the files must have had a password.\nOLIVIA: So it was someone in the clinic?\nBROYLES: It would seem that way.\n(confronting Nayak just moments later)\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (to Olivia) It's not possible. My employees are good people. They've all worked here for years. We're a family.\nOLIVIA: But they all had the password?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: There was no reason for them not to. I'm telling you none of them would have done this. (emphatically sincere)\nPETER: (entering with new information) Agent Dunham. Another one.\nMISTER LAMIA: (as a body bag is hauled away with his daughter in it) Her eyes were going crazy. (distraught) Her hair turned white, then she collapsed. I don't understand. She screamed we were cannibals... and then attacked with a knife. I had to wrestle it away from her. She -- she was so happy. This doesn't make sense. (overwhelmed, as Nayak and Peter watch from the end of the counter)\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (afterwards with Peter and Olivia) Diane suffered from night terrors. She was just in my office last week.\nPETER: We're gonna have to make a public announcement.\nOLIVIA: (to Nayak) I'm gonna get our media liaison to put an announcement on the local news.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (just realizing) Zach Miller, my lab assistant... skipped work today. He hasn't been answering his phone.\nOLIVIA: (as Peter knocks) Zach Miller? F.B.I.!\n(Peter shoulders the door from its' frame and the two enter and begin to search. At his office, Nayak finds and opens a letter near his door - the message... no Feds - or wind-up like Zach)\nPETER: Olivia. (she turns to discover what Peter found) I guess that's why he wasn't answering the phone. (Zach is dead - neatly tucked into his entertainment center)\nASTRID: (standing next to her unconscious fellow Junior Agent) Walter. What's wrong with Agent Kashner?\nWALTER: (candidly) I drugged him.\nASTRID: You drugged him? Walter... don't tell me you put that chip in his head.\nWALTER: No, but I wanted to. And then I realized that I could attach the chip to an E.E.G. net, and the signal would reach his brain.\nASTRID: And how are you going to send him commands?\nWALTER: I have wired the neurostimulator to the same frequency. If Peter's theory is correct... and this is mind control, then the chip should receive commands from me, through the neurostimulator, it's then translated into impulses that Agent Kashner's brain can understand. (lifts the cranial brace) I need help putting this on.\nASTRID: Walter. I do not think this is a very good idea!\nWALTER: Don't be such a Grinch. I've told you, science should be fun. Come on.\nWALTER: (on a reclined bed, after he has been connected by Astrid) Look at his feet.\nASTRID: Feet. Got it. (less than amused)\nWALTER: (wiggles feet) Anything?\nASTRID: Nope. (after he emotes) Walter, what is it?\nWALTER: (ecstatic) Either a green unicorn just raced across the lab, or I accidentally took some L.S.D. Oh. Oh, it must be mescaline. (nearly orgasmic) It's peaking too quickly. Oh. Oh. That's not mescaline. It's something else entirely. I think it's not the drugs at all. I think I have an idea what it is. (trails off)\nOLIVIA: And you've never gotten anything like this before?\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: No, of course not.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna send a copy of this to our Question Documents Unit. They'll analyze the handwriting, the paper, and the ink. But in the meantime, the police have offered to put a protective detail outside your clinic, and Detective Green will watch your house. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're gonna try and track down the rest of your patients.\nPETER: Don't worry, Doctor Nayak. We're gonna catch this guy. Then you can get back to your work. We'll call you as soon as we know something.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (places phone call after they leave him. no one answers. he hears a voice recording to leave a message at the tone, and does so) I told them. I showed them your damn note. So you might as well stop.\nPETER: (conference calling on the cell phone as Olivia drives in the Seattle night) So it's not mind control?\nWALTER: (sitting in the lab) No, Peter, your theory is wrong. Doctor Nayak's chips aren't receiving commands... they're transmitting massive amounts of data.\nPETER: Walter, the bio-chips are supposed to transmit data, that's their function, to monitor sleep cycles.\nWALTER: The chips aren't simply monitoring sleep... they're accessing all the sensory information that -- that passes through the thalamus -- every color, sound, and picture while we sleep.\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you saying that Doctor Nayak's bio-chips are stealing dreams?\nWALTER: That's right.\nPETER: Leiter's sleep journal. He slept for hours, but he never had any dreams.\nWALTER: Before they reached his consciousness, they were all siphoned off, which means no dreams. The brain can never recharge, and that...\nPETER: ...would lead to death by exhaustion.\nWALTER: Exactly. What's more, I believe that the chips have the ability to turn on a dreaming state while the patient is awake, which would lead to paranoia, hallucinations, and a complete inability to differentiate between reality and dreams -- the very behavior we've been witnessing.\nPETER: Walter, why would anybody want to access another person's dreams?\nWALTER: The Rush, Peter. (dreamily) Think of your most pleasant dream, multiply that feeling tenfold, all main-lining through your Cortex in a few seconds. It's really quite something.\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you saying that we're dealing with an addict?\nWALTER: Not just an addict, dear. A man who came in contact with this drug -- in my estimation, that man would become its slave.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) We got to go back to the hotel.\nPETER: (to Olivia) What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: (to Peter, while marching back through her hotel room door) Walter thinks we're looking for an addict, right? Well, my stepfather was an addict. He was a drunk. And it was like he had two different personalities -- one when he was sober and one when he was smashed. The deeper the addiction, the more extreme the rift, like, uh, Jekyll and Hyde. So this is the patient list that Doctor Nayak wrote out, and here is the death threat he received. The handwriting's sloped, but look at the \"g\"s and the \"f\"s. (points to writing on separate pages) These are written by the same person.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: Thank you, Detective Green. (as he is walked to his front door)\nANSWERING MACHINE: (enters house and presses button on answering machine) You have one message.\nLAXMEESH NAYAK: (recorded in his own voice - to himself) I told them. I showed them your damn note. So you might as well stop. Please.\n(Nayak enters his home lab, dons his skull cap loaded with electrodes and calls up another sleep clinic patient to tap into. he finds Jack. Jack is the aircraft commander of a seaplane preparing to take-off from Lake Union. Jack has crewmembers and passengers aboard for the evening flight from the waterway near downtown Seattle)\nCOPILOT: (to Jack) The water rudder is set.\nCAPTAIN JACK: (accepts a beverage from the flight attendant) Thanks, Hon.\n(Nayak sits at home in his reclining chair. his eyes roll back as he revels in his addiction)\nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: (chatter... then) November 8-2-2, you are cleared for take-off.\n(Nayak sits in his arm chair and enters the mind of the seaplane Captain beginning his takeoff sequence at Lake Union seaport. radio chatter continues as the plane gets up to speed. the pilot looks over at his co-pilot and sees nothing but a skin covered orb covering the mans' face, a fear-inspiring delusion)\nCOPILOT: (as the pilot grows alarmed and aims the seaplane toward the broadside of a docked cruise-liner) Jack, what are you doing? Jack. Jack. Jack, what are you doing?\n(Olivia, Peter and Detective Green race to Nayak's house and enter)\nCOPILOT: Jack, we have got to get this bird in the air. Jack! (to ATC) November 8-2-2, pilot in distress! Jack!\nOLIVIA: (finding Nayak entranced in his addiction) Peter, he's plugged in.\nPETER: Let me try to shut down the program. (attacking the keyboard)\nCOPILOT: November 8-2-2 to A.T.C., I've got a problem!\nPETER: (failing on the keyboard) I'm gonna to have to try to disable the server.\nOLIVIA: Can you shut it down?\nPETER: (flipping toggles on the server panel) I think it's locked.\nCOPILOT: (panic in the cockpit) Jack! November 8-2-2, squawking sevety-seven hundred!\nOLIVIA: Okay, stand back. (warning Peter)\nPETER: Whoa. (as she shoots the server mainframe six times and terminates the link to the seaplane)\nCOPILOT: ...collision... collision... Jack!\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT: Jack! Jack. (her screaming revitalizes the recovering pilot. the aircraft startles passengers on the cruise ship as it just barely clears the upper deck)\nPETER: (checking Nayak's pulse) He's dead.\nDETECTIVE GREEN: (greeting Peter and Olivia as they exit Nayak's house with CSI behind them) Hey. Got a call from, uh, radio control at Lake Union -- incident with a seaplane pilot, one of Nayak's patients. They're all safe. Good work.\nPETER: (to Olivia, privately) I checked out Nayak's control panel. All the dials were cranked up into the red.\nOLIVIA: You think he decided to go down in one final blaze of glory?\nPETER: Actually, I think it was a lot more complicated than that. You remember how horrified Nayak was when we told him his patients were dying? I don't think that he was fully aware of what his darker side was up to... until tonight.\nOLIVIA: So this was his way of trying to put a stop to things.\nPETER: I guess that's the irony. His addiction to dreams became his nightmare, one that he couldn't wake up from. Maybe that was his only way of ending the nightmare. (Olivia ponders that gem)\n(Olivia pulls into a cemetery, parks, and sullenly finds her way to a friends grave. she kneels down and places flowers next to the headstone of Charlie Francis - Beloved Husband and Friend - June 22, 1976 to Oct 8, 2009. she gets in her car to leave and finally, happily decodes the Jumble Sam suggested she might decode)\n(older Peter dreams as old Walter monitors him in their new home)\nYOUNG PETER: (Peter dreams one of his youthful late night encounters with his father) Dad, what's wrong? (screams)\nPETER: (awakes and sees his father nearby) What is it?\nWALTER: Nothing. You were talking in your sleep. (solemn)\nPETER: Yeah, I think I was having a bad dream. I was a kid, in my room. You were there.\nWALTER: And the rest? (cryptically) You don't remember it?\nPETER: (clueless) uhnt-uh."

    "Script":"\"Earthling\" is the sixth episode of the second season of Fringe.\n1 Synopsis 2 Plot 3 Notable Quotes 4 Notes 5 Goofs 6 Music 7 Cypher\nThe Fringe Division is flummoxed by a case where victims are inexplicably disintegrated into ash. Agent Broyles takes a particular interest in the case, as it is revealed that he worked on this case in the past, and had been so involved that it cost him his marriage. He says that everyone who died had recently been to a hospital. The investigation reveals that Fringe science extends all the way to Russia.\nRandy Dancik is waiting at home to surprise his wife, Natalie Dancik, but the light in the hallway keep flicking on and off. His wife arrives home, to see him sitting in his chair but he does not respond. He suddenly begins turning to ash. Later, Walter Bishop, Peter Bishop and Olivia Dunham are at Dancik's house, Walter is examining the body. Walter says that they need to get the body back to the lab, Peter asks how they are going to get \"Dusty\" back. Walter says they need a Dirt Devil... a lot of Dirt Devils.\nBack in the lab, Walter discovers that the victims lack the minute amount of radiation normally found in a human being. Meanwhile, corpses in a hospital morgue begin to turn to ash as a ghost-like figure stalks the halls. Walter states that it is a projection of a creature who is possessing someone. The case is linked back to Timur Vasiliev at the hospital, who then takes his brother Aleks Vasiliev, a former cosmonaut in a vegetative state, from the hospital. The thing is inside his brother, and the doctor uses car batteries to keep it under control.\nPhillip Broyles says he has seen these killings before, and has a formula he was meant to solve. The case cost him his marriage. Walter is able to solve it for the doctor, who Broyles contacted, but not before the doctor also dies. The Fringe team discover that the creature is something from outer space that possessed the cosmonaut on a spacewalk. They cannot kill it, but are able to stop it when Broyles shoots the brother. The CIA takes over the case, and Agent Edwards visits Broyles. When Broyles asked what happened to the brother, the agent mentions \"we had no choice, once he started breathing again\" and looks up at the night sky.\nOlivia: Walter, do you have any thoughts? Walter: Reminds me of Christmas. Like a fire log that burns so hot it remains intact., holding the shape of its former self. You used to love that when you were a child. You'd poke the log with your little finger when it had cooled, and you'd draw genitalia on the reindeer decorations. Peter: Happy memories, Walter.\nAstrid: So this thing followed him from the hospital? I'm not going to sleep for weeks.\nBroyles: I took the job to make the world a safer place for my family. Instead, I lost them.\nPeter: Are you suggesting that this was some sort of Russian experiment? Walter: Because they're from the other side of the world, Peter, is it so hard to believe they have their own stripe of the inconceivable? Really I'm always amazed at their advancements even 40 years ago. You wouldn't believe what those pinkos were up to.\nThe Observer can be seen at the airport to the right and behind Phillip Broyles as he talks to Olivia Dunham on his cellphone. The X- Files connections: This episode's plot shares remarkable similarity with the plot of the The X-Files season 1 episode \"Space.\" In that episode a former astronaut is plagued with an organism from space that has occupied his body. The hospital interior is the same hospital interior used in pilot episode and second theatrical movie of The X-Files. The character of \"Van Horn\" is portrayed by actor Gerard Plunkett, who portrayed the prominent recurring role of Doctor Calderon in two episodes on The X-Files. This marks the sixth consecutive instance in which an actor who worked on The X-Files has a role in a Fringe episode. Another The X-Files reference is the similar supernatural ability shown by the antagonist in the season 6 episode \"Trevor.\" In that episode, Wilson \"Pinker\" Rawls displays an ability to physically pass through solid matter, but in doing so he strips out all its elements leaving behind a brittle, ash-like compound that crumbles when touched. The cartoon the girl watches is Kimba, the white lion (Janguru Taitei), a Japanese anime series from the 1960's, created by Osamu Tezuka. As of this episode, Kirk Acevedo no longer receives show star credit. Although credited, Blair Brown (Nina Sharp) does not appear in this episode.\nWhen the body of the character Randy is shown before and after combustion, his hands (thumbs in particular) have changed position. When Senator Van Horn's and Broyles meet in the park, there is a man on a red bicycle passing by them twice in eleven seconds. Same direction, left to right.\n\"Freezing\" by Mozella \"Straighten Up and Fly Right\" by Nat King Cole \"Una Furtiva Lagrima\" by Mario Lanza"

Hands on your head! (to the two men and teenage boy inside)\nOFFICER WILLIAMS: (into her radio) This is Officer Williams. Hostage appears unharmed.\nOFFICER GIBSON: I said get out of the car, now! (the two men comply) Step away from the car. Then on your knees.\nOFFICER WILLIAMS: (to the teenage boy still in the car) You okay? (the boy nods)\nTOM DOBBINS: You have no idea what you're dealing with.\nOFFICER GIBSON: Is that right? (begins to feel strange and backs away from the felony arrest)\nOFFICER WILLIAMS: What the hell are you doing? Gibson, I'm talking to you. Gibson!\n(Gibson drops his pistol and falls backward over the edge of the structure, at least a dozen stories to the ground. Williams starts to lose control too. she shoots the other two officers and then herself, in the temple)\nBROYLES: We're running the security photos through facial recognition software. We should have the kidnappers' names within the hour. Preliminary ballistics confirms that Officer Williams fired all three shots.\nOLIVIA: Including the one that killed her?\nBROYLES: Self-inflicted. As far as we can tell, the kidnappers don't even have guns.\nPETER: Who's the kid?\nOLIVIA: Tyler Carson. Fifteen years old. According to N.Y.P.D., he disappeared thirty six hours ago. They are still running leads.\nPETER: (crowded by his father) Walter, remember that conversation we had about personal space?\nWALTER: I'm bored. No cadavers at this crime scene. Or food.\nOLIVIA: Walter, they're transferring the bodies to your lab now.\nWALTER: There's no need -- I've already formed an hypothesis as to what happened here. Mesmerism. Hypnotism. The victims have obviously been subjected to subliminal suggestions of a violent nature.\nPETER: Walter, hypnosis can't make you do anything that you don't want to do. Take a look at this. The kidnapped kid's father -- he works for Fleming-Monroe.\nBROYLES: The Aerospace Division of Massive Dynamic. I already have a call in to Nina Sharp.\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: Miz Sharp's office is right this way. Doctor Carson is in there waiting with her now.\nWALTER: (amazed with the soaring architecture) Uh, Miss? The screen in the elevator said there are seventy-three laboratories. Is -- is that right?\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: Yes.\nWALTER: It's amazing. (continues the grandiose trek)\nOLIVIA: (sitting for interview) Doctor Carson, why didn't you call the police sooner?\nJAMES CARSON: I didn't even know he was gone until I got the call from them -- The men who took him. Tyler and I don't talk much. I -- I just figured it's because of his age. You know what teens are like. I guess that's just an excuse, isn't it?\nOLIVIA: So what did the kidnappers say?\nJAMES CARSON: Just to wait for further instruction.\nPETER: Miz Sharp, the two men identified in those photographs, are you absolutely certain they have no connection to your company?\nNINA: Yes, we cross-referenced their names with our employee database. Patrick Hickey and Tom Dobbins have never worked for us, and they've had no peripheral involvement with any of our clients or partners. According to the police, they're used car salesmen.\nOLIVIA: And there's been no indication of their demands?\nJAMES CARSON: No, not yet.\nOLIVIA: So is it possible that these men are trying to extort secrets from Massive Dynamic?\nNINA: We have come to the same conclusion.\nPETER: Well, would you care to share what kind of secrets?\nNINA: (hesitant) Doctor Carson performs sensitive and highly-classified work on military aircraft designs, piloting software, guidance systems.\nJAMES CARSON: What I do here, it's -- it's my life. It's the only -- Tyler's mother died when he was just a boy. And now if -- if I lose him, I don't know what I'd do.\nPETER: (Walter marches out) I'll get him. Excuse me. (Peter follows)\nOLIVIA: Doctor Carson, we will do everything we can to try and find your son.\nPETER: (catches up in the hallway) Hey, Walter. What are you doing?\nWALTER: Massive Dynamic... it was just a name until now. Did you know that I once shared a laboratory with William Bell?\nPETER: You might have mentioned that once or twice.\nWALTER: Look how much he's achieved. You know, he introduced me to her.\nPETER: To whom?\nWALTER: Your mother. After the Neurobiology Conference in Berlin. It was our idea, you know, that Belly and I would one day form a company together. He just couldn't wait, I suppose. But thankfully she was still there for you while I was gone.\nTYLER CARSON: (from the backseat of the car) I'm hungry.\nPATRICK HICKEY: (marching into the store) Give me all the cash in the register.\nCLERK: You kidding me? You don't even have a gun.\nPATRICK HICKEY: Just do it, before somebody gets hurt.\nTRUCK DRIVER: Hey, buddy, is there gonna be a problem here?\nPATRICK HICKEY: You really don't want to get involved in this.\nTRUCK DRIVER: I think I just did. (poors a pot of hot coffee on his own head, breaks the pot on his head and runs head first into a glass door) Aah! Aah!\nCLERK: (points his pistol) Get out of my store.\nPATRICK HICKEY: You should have just given up the money.\nCLERK: (forced to stick a metal key in an electrical outlet) Unh!\nPETER: (while watching the carnage in replay) Remind me to never get a job as a convenience store clerk. Any witnesses?\nOLIVIA: Both victims are in intensive care at University Hospital. So, no statements anytime soon.\nPETER: Stealing food and knocking over convenience stores? These kidnappers don't really seem like they have much of a plan.\nOLIVIA: No. There's a second feed on the door. (about Tyler) He looks so scared.\nPETER: So why doesn't he run? He could just make a break for it. Far too soon for Stockholm Syndrome to have kicked in.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe your father's right. Maybe one or both of them are controlling people through hypnotic suggestion.\nPETER: Then they could just get the clerk to give 'em the cash. Why all the carnage?\nOLIVIA: Maybe they're silencing the witnesses. They don't want us to know how it works. (answers phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: I just talked to the owner of the car dealership where the kidnappers worked. Said Hickey and Dobbins were his best salesmen.\nOLIVIA: So is there anything out of the ordinary about these two guys?\nBROYLES: Model employees. The owner was completely mystified as to how they got mixed up in this. Says they each made a sale that morning, took one of his loaner cars out for lunch, and never came back.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (hangs-up) Broyles says the suspects were good at their jobs. No criminal record. Boss loves 'em. So how do these two become kidnappers?\nPETER: You think they could be spies? Maybe they're hiding out in plain sight.\nOLIVIA: Foreign intelligence agents often take mundane jobs so they can blend in while they're gathering information.\nPETER: There's certainly nothing more mundane than being a used car salesman.\nOLIVIA: So throw in Massive Dynamic and your father's theory on hypnotism and it all starts to add up.\nASTRID: (as Walter goes to work with an electric bone saw) Chicken. You serious?\nWALTER: Just a hypothesis. What do you think, more like pork?\nASTRID: Truthfully, I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about what human brains would taste like.\nWALTER: Then why did you ask?\nASTRID: I was asking what you expected to find with this brain.\nWALTER: Oh. And normally hypnosis would simply... boost the alpha wave of the brain With no visible effect. But given the extreme nature of the suggestions in this policewoman's case, I suspect there might be lesions on the brain. And visible damage. Oh, yes... Oh, my. Thank you.\n(joined later by the rest of the science team, after cleaning-up)\nWALTER: Now, this is not hypnosis. It is mind control.\nOLIVIA: There's a difference?\nWALTER: Oh, yes. Peter was right. Hypnosis can only go so far -- suggesting, but not forcing behavior. Look, look, look. Hematomas on the brain matter. Indicating actual trauma. The result of conflicting neural impulses. A conflict of mind and body.\nOLIVIA: Is that what killed them?\nWALTER: Oh, no, no, no. No... the bullet took care of that. No, but mind control could cause brain damage. I theorize that the power operates through the cochlear nerve.\nPETER: You mean sound.\nWALTER: Yes. An auditory trance is a far more effective path manipulation than the other senses. But again, it's just a hypothesis.\nASTRID: Even if we find out where they are, nobody can get near them as long as they have this talent.\nOLIVIA: Then I need you to work out how to block it. The ransom call could come at any minute, and we need to be ready.\nWALTER: Right. Right. Right.\n(in a private office)\nJAMES CARSON: I don't understand. Why are we just standing around? Shouldn't we do something?\nBROYLES: Doctor Carson... I have my very best agents on the case. But you need to be here when the kidnappers call.\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: (knocks and enters) Special Agent Broyles? We've just received a call for Doctor Carson. It's his son.\n(in a crowded room)\nTECHNICIAN: We're ready, sir.\nJAMES CARSON: (picks-up phone) Hello?\nTYLER CARSON: Dad... it's me.\nJAMES CARSON: Tyler, are you okay?\nTYLER CARSON: Just give them what they want. Please.\nTOM DOBBINS: You've seen that we won't hesitate to do whatever's necessary in order to get what we want.\nJAMES CARSON: Please, listen, I'll do anything you need -- anything!\nTOM DOBBINS: Two million dollars, unmarked bills, the industrial park off I-78, Western Newark Airport. 5:00 P.M. If you're even a minute late, your son dies.\nJAMES CARSON: No, please, listen (caller hangs-up) -- Tyler?\nTECHNICIAN: No luck sir, he hung-up too soon.\nOLIVIA: Money? All they want is money?\nJAMES CARSON: I can sell the house. Cash in my stock options...\nNINA: Massive Dynamic will cover any ransom.\nBROYLES: They're trying to squeeze a major international corporation with a kidnapping. It doesn't add up.\nOLIVIA: Money's the distraction. They want something else. They took your son for a reason.\nJAMES CARSON: So what now?\nOLIVIA: We set a trap.\nWALTER: (singing jauntily as he rummages thru storage) Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes, sir, yes...\nASTRID: (privately) Peter, we're running out of time. You don't have any idea what your father's looking for?\nPETER: No. He just muttered something about my childhood.\nWALTER: Aha. (pulls a teddy bear from a box) Here it is. It generates white noise, which simulates the sound of being in-utero. (fetal sounds throb) Huh? Huh? Just what we need to block the mind control.\nPETER: A teddy bear versus mind control spies? Bad guys don't stand a chance.\nOLIVIA: Doctor Carson will meet the kidnapper with the briefcase. So take no action until the exchange is complete. We want clean shots only. We want them alive, if possible. But the boy's safety comes first.\nWALTER: (privately to Peter as they wait) This is exciting. You think the F.B.I. will ever give me a gun?\nOLIVIA: Doctor Bishop will now explain how to use the equipment that you've been provided.\nWALTER: (very formal) Yes. Hello. I am Doctor Walter Bishop. You've been given a set of audio-adapting earphones like this, (holds-up a set) which will give off a steady stream of white noise...\nPETER: (simply put) ...the headphones will make it so the kidnappers can't control you with sound. Now, put 'em on. We gotta do a sound check.\n(nothing but pulsating noise can be heard by those wearing headsets as Walter tries to conclude his lecture)\nWALTER: My son Peter's teddy bear emits a sound... as you listen, you may feel a sense of deep tranquility, as if you returned to your mother's womb. (oblivious that no one hears him)\nPETER: (hands Walter the microphone he needs) Um, Walter, I think you're gonna need this.\nWALTER: Thank you, Peter. (turns the mic on) You will now be able to hear my voice. Each of your team leaders will have a microphone like this one. You will not be able to communicate with each other directly. All commands will come through the headphones. Once you're given the order to put on the headphones, do not remove them under any circumstances. If you do, you may die a gruesome and horrible death. Thank you for your attention. And have a nice day.\n(teams are deployed, snipers positioned and visual surveillance begins as Doctor Carson approaches with the ransom)\nALPHA COMM: (over radio) Alpha Team in position.\nBRAVO COMM: (over radio) Brave Team in position.\nALPHA COMM: Agent Dunham, we have a brown sedan entering in on the North side.\nOLIVIA: Do you see Tyler in the vehicle?\nALPHA COMM: That's a negative.\nOLIVIA: All teams stand by and hold position. Bravo Team, what's your status?\nBRAVO COMM: We have somebody moving in on foot.\nALPHA COMM: Copy that. Possible suspect en route to Doctor Carson.\nOLIVIA: All units, headphones on. Team leaders, move communication to microphones. (everyone, including Walter and Peter, don headsets. Carson is approached by Dobbins for the ransom exchange) Contact made. Can anyone see the hostage?\nALPHA COMM: This is Alpha Leader. Negative. I've got nothing.\nBRAVO COMM: Bravo. Negative on my end too.\nOLIVIA: (Dobbins grabs the ransom from Doctor Carson) All units, move! Move!\n(all agents converge on the warehouse. Hickey crashes the brown sedan through the garage door, rolls it, and the vehicle burst into flames. Peter leaves Walter to chase the money as it departs the area. Olivia pursues Dobbins deeper inside the building. )\nTOM DOBBINS: (to Olivia when she approaches, as he repeatedly tries to fire an empty pistol into his lower jaw) Help me! Help me.\n(elsewhere on the grounds, Peter runs around the corner of a building, forced to a halt and unable to move)\nTYLER CARSON: You can lose the stupid headphones. (pops a pill) They don't work. (grabs the briefcase full of money) Take me to your car. (Walter's station wagon accelerates thru the gravel as Peter is kidnapped)\nOLIVIA: (outside. talking in to handheld radio) Agent Balik, this is Agent Dunham.\nAGENT BALIK: (radio) Copy. Go for Balik.\nOLIVIA: Any sign of Tyler Carson?\nAGENT BALIK: Negative. We did two full sweeps. This place is abandoned.\nWALTER: (approaches) Olivia? Agent Dunham. Where is he?\nOLIVIA: Tyler? We're still looking for him, Walter.\nWALTER: No, no, no, I don't mean Tyler. I mean Peter. I thought he was with you. He's gone. I can't find him anywhere.\nOLIVIA: (into handheld radio) Uh, has anyone seen Peter Bishop?\n(inside. under interrogation)\nTOM DOBBINS: I told you, we were the hostages in that car.\nOLIVIA: Tyler Carson wanted you to kidnap him?\nTOM DOBBINS: I'm saying he made us do it. He worked us like puppets. He forced us to drive. He made us watch all those people die!\nBROYLES: What about the ransom call?\nTOM DOBBINS: I told you, he made us say what he wanted!\nOLIVIA: How did he do that, exactly?\nTOM DOBBINS: I don't know how he does it. You think I wanted to saw off my own finger? He made me do it when I tried to get away. (hold-ups bandaged hand, minus a few digits) And that friend of yours you keep talking about. You better pray he's not with that kid.\nTYLER CARSON: Head hurts pretty bad, huh? (Peter groans and grimaces while driving) That's what happens when you try to fight it. I can make it stop if you do what I say.\nPETER: (forced) Yes. Oh... (relieved)\nTYLER CARSON: Keep driving straight.\nPETER: You know, your father's worried about you.\nTYLER CARSON: Awesome.\nPETER: Come on, kid, let's pull over and talk about -- (forced to accelerate)\nTYLER CARSON: Hey, bad idea!\nPETER: What are you doing? (forced to swerve thru traffic)\nTYLER CARSON: Let's see how fast this piece of junk can go.\nPETER: Kid, you're gonna kill us!\nTYLER CARSON: (aiming to wreck the back of a truck) Are you ready to behave?\nPETER: Yes! (released from control, he slams the brakes and stops the car)\nTYLER CARSON: Just so we're clear... I can make you do whatever I want. I can control all of you, or just part of you.\nPETER: You know what, kid... you're a real son of a bitch.\nOLIVIA: (in Nina's office) It's Tyler. Tyler is the kidnapper. This was taken from a traffic cam on I-95. He's the one controlling people, and he's taken Peter hostage.\nNINA: How could this have happened?\nOLIVIA: The son of one of your top scientists can control people's minds? Surely that's not a coincidence.\nNINA: That doesn't seem possible. But Doctor Carson works in aerospace. But on one of his projects, he's been collaborating with the Pharmaceutical Division.\nOLIVIA: What project?\nNINA: (later, in a testing area) This is our flight simulation deck. What you're watching is a live test of our prototype hands-free guidance system.\nOLIVIA: Hands-free navigation. So who's controlling the jet?\nNINA: Electrodes in the pilot's helmet are picking up on his thought patterns, which send commands to an onboard computer.\nJAMES: The pilot has been given a pharmaceutical enhancement -- a drug to amplify his brainwaves. Which makes it easier for the electrodes in the helmet to read them.\nWALTER: Doctor Carson, did you, perchance, expose your son to this so-called pharmaceutical enhancement?\nNINA: Massive Dynamic has strict testing protocols. Family members are absolutely ruled out as test subjects.\nJAMES: Oh, my god. I took some samples home for further research. Tyler might have found them.\nPETER: (driving the car willingly) I got a question. How far away can you control people?\nTYLER CARSON: You mean, how far do you have to run? Nice try.\nPETER: When did you figure out that you were able to --\nTYLER CARSON: I'm not telling you anything, alright?\nPETER: Hey, genius, the second you took me, they knew that you were behind it all.\nTYLER CARSON: Whatever. You had no idea that I was the one in charge.\nPETER: Yeah. You managed to kidnap yourself -- congratulations. You're a criminal mastermind.\nTYLER CARSON: Screw you.\nPETER: You really haven't thought this out, have you? I mean, you don't even have a plan.\nTYLER CARSON: Shut up. You sound just like my father.\nPETER: Oh, come on. That's what this is about? Some sort of vendetta against your Dad? Do you really think that you're the first kid whose father didn't think he was good enough, or smart enough? Take a number.\nJAMES CARSON: ...but it doesn't make sense because even if tyler did take the drugs, they're designed to work on computer systems, not on other human beings.\nWALTER: The brain is a computer, Doctor. It's an organic computer. It can be hijacked like any other. (approaches. angry) So how old is this boy? Fifteen? Still going through puberty? Yes?\nJAMES CARSON: Yes.\nWALTER: Yes! His system flooded with hormones affecting his neural transmitters. Opening up the pathways for the uptake of psychoactive chemicals, yes?\nJAMES CARSON: I suppose it's possible. Yes.\nWALTER: Oh, it is. It's possible, alright. And was he, by chance, taking any prescription medication? Psychostimulants, perhaps?\nJAMES CARSON: Yes.\nWALTER: Yes!\nJAMES CARSON: Tyler was taking medication for Attention Deficit Disorder.\nWALTER: (smoltering) ...well, puberty, A.D.D. medication, and an untested brainwave enhancer. It's a mind control cocktail. Because of this man's inability to be a proper parent, his son has kidnapped mine!\nNINA: Walter!\nPETER: You know, I used to hate my father too. I know what it's like.\nTYLER CARSON: I need a driver, alright? Not a big brother. (after lights and sirens start behind them) Don't stop.\nPETER: Kid, this has been a ton of fun, but let's get real here. It cannot go on forever.\nTYLER CARSON: I say it's not even close to finished. (concedes) Pull over.\nPETER: Let me take care of this.\nTYLER CARSON: If you don't, I will.\nPETER: (after rolling window) Evening, officer.\nOFFICER JENKS: Sir, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.\nPETER: Sure.\nOFFICER JENKS: Put your hands on the car.\nPETER: (politely) I'm sorry, Officer, did I do something wrong?\nOFFICER JENKS: (unyielding) I said up against the car. You got any kind of weapon on you, you should tell me now.\n(Tyler influences the officer to place his pistol on the car next to Peter)\nPETER: Tyler! (as he is forced to pick-up and point the pistol at the officer) Tyler! Tyler, please. Do not force me to shoot this man.\nTYLER CARSON: He'll tell them where we are. They'll try to stop us.\nPETER: Please! Please! Come on, Tyler. There's gotta be another way.\nOFFICER JENKS: (as Peter pistol-whips him) Unh!\nTYLER CARSON: (curtly) Something like that?\nOLIVIA: (on the phone) We lost them on the New Jersey Turnpike heading South towards Swedesboro. We have a chopper shadowing the vehicle. We need all assets rerouted to that vicinity. Let me know if you spot him. Thanks. (hangs-up) Astrid? You tell the state troopers if they spot them, to keep their distance. Stay just within visual range. And make sure they know that peter is not the target.\nASTRID: Yeah.\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: Agent Dunham, you're needed in Miz Sharp's office.\nOLIVIA: (enters office) What's wrong?\nBROYLES: The Director's just classified Tyler Carson as a national security threat. Fringe Division has been ordered to stand down. Any intercept will be handled by special forces.\nOLIVIA: But we're the only reason they have any clue what's really going on. How can they take us off now?\nBROYLES: New information has come to light about Tyler's plans. Turns out he purchased two one-way tickets to Costa Rica, which he bought before abducting Peter. Headquarters believes the boy may be working with a foreign handler.\nOLIVIA: With respect, all the evidence points towards an angry kid.\nBROYLES: Best-case scenario, we have a highly intelligent malcontent on a killing spree. Besides, the Director thinks it's worse. Tyler may have been recruited to deliver a multi-million dollar defense project to our country's enemies.\nOLIVIA: (reading the memo he handed her) \"overwhelming force will be brought to bear if necessary\"? You know what this means. Peter could be collateral damage.\nBROYLES: But regardless, we need to contain the situation on our own before it's too late.\nOLIVIA: (joining him in a quiet room) Walter? Have you made any headway?\nWALTER: (solemn) I can't lose him again.\nOLIVIA: Walter... I know you're worried. We all are. But we can get Peter back. We just need you to find a way to disable Tyler.\nWALTER: Peter always helps me. I don't know what to do. How do I do this without Peter? He always helps me.\nOLIVIA: He helps me too. But you can do this.\nNINA: Walter... I know you're scared. But you're the only one that can help him.\nWALTER: Maybe I could use an EMF scrambler to disrupt his beta wave transmissions.\nNINA: Sounds like a good place to start.\nASTRID: (enters room) Olivia, I think I found something. They just brought Tyler's computer in. He's been doing some pretty strange searches.\nOLIVIA: (standing next to monitor as Astrid works) This is what he was looking for? Obituaries and death notices?\nASTRID: All are women who died fourteen years ago in car accidents.\nOLIVIA: Look, all these women died in their mid-twenties.\nASTRID: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: So that would make them what, about forty now if they were alive?\nASTRID: What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: I don't know yet. Can you pull up his most recent search?\nASTRID: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: What do you know about Renee Davies? Who is she?\nJAMES CARSON: She's my ex-wife. Tyler's mother. (looks at news article in his hand) Where'd you find this?\nOLIVIA: It was on Tyler's computer.\n(sitting next to a runway as a pair legs dances by, eating steak from cheap plates)\nTYLER CARSON: This was a good idea.\nPETER: Yeah, I was fifteen once too. But I had to talk my way into places like this. You know, there are plenty of easier ways to get money.\nTYLER CARSON: Yeah, but it wouldn't have been as fun.\nPETER: Fun? Faking your kidnapping... jacking your dad's company... killing cops and innocent bystanders --\nTYLER CARSON: That wasn't part of the plan. Okay? They just... Got in the way.\nPETER: You know, I get it. I mean, you wanted to torture your dad, right? But the thing just got away from you. Blew up in your face.\nTYLER CARSON: It's not done yet.\nPETER: What did your daddy do to you anyway? Didn't pay you enough attention? Forgot your birthday? Didn't play ball with you enough?\nTYLER CARSON: He lied to me my entire life.\nPETER: Let's not get dramatic.\nTYLER CARSON: He told me my mother was dead.\nJAMES CARSON: But you have to understand, she was a mess. She was on drugs, off drugs. I mean, I never knew what she was gonna do next. When Tyler was a baby, she would literally disappear for weeks at a time. And then finally she -- she just never came back.\nOLIVIA: Does Tyler know what happened?\nJAMES CARSON: I didn't know! I -- I just always assumed that she would end up dead of an overdose somewhere. And then when Tyler was old enough to start asking about her, I told him that she died in a car wreck. I thought it was for the best. So he wouldn't know that his mother abandoned him.\nTYLER CARSON: About a month ago I found my birth certificate. Learned her name. And then I tried to find her. Guess what I found.\nPETER: That she was never really dead at all.\nTYLER CARSON: She lives in Maryland. She's some sort of rehab counselor.\nPETER: So what, you think if you find her... the two of you are just gonna live happily ever after?\nTYLER CARSON: We're gonna be a family again --\nPETER: Those cops you killed, they have families too. They got wives, they got -- (goes quiet as Tyler takes control of his mind, has him pick-up his steak and makes Peter stab it into the seat of the chair right next to him)\nTYLER CARSON: That would have been in your leg, if I didn't need you to drive. Let's go.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we know where Tyler's going. Please tell me you've got something better to stop him with than what you're wearing. (looks at his aluminum foil hat)\nWALTER: Oh, this has nothing to do with the case. (softly) I don't trust them here. I think they're trying to read my thoughts.\nASTRID: (chimes-in) Massive Dynamic gives me the creeps too.\nWALTER: According to Doctor Carson's data, the pilots that were treated with this drug were highly responsive to magnetic fields. So we are modifying an electromagnetic pulse... to target his brainwaves.\nOLIVIA: What does that mean?\nASTRID: We're gonna crash his brain.\nWALTER: This device will wipe his brain of all thought. Uh, for a short period. He won't be able to think. He will become severely disoriented. He may even vomit.\nASTRID: Which, hopefully, will give you the window you need to take him down.\nOLIVIA: Okay, let's pack it up. We're leaving.\nWALTER: Good.\nTYLER CARSON: Renee Davies?\nRENEE DAVIES: (stands-up from her gardening chore) Yes. Can I help you?\nTYLER CARSON: Mom... It's me, Tyler. Your son.\nRENEE DAVIES: Oh, my God.\nTYLER CARSON: I found you!\nRENEE DAVIES: (eyeballs Peter) Who's this?\nPETER: You mind if we go inside?\nRENEE DAVIES: Of course.\nMom, listen, I don't blame you for leaving, alright? I blame him.\nRENEE DAVIES: I don't understand --\nTYLER CARSON: Dad. He didn't want me to be with you.\nRENEE DAVIES: Oh, no, Tyler. It wasn't like that.\nTYLER CARSON: But it's okay now. I'm here. We can go.\nRENEE DAVIES: Go? Go where?\nTYLER CARSON: Anywhere. Another country.\nSETH DAVIES: Hey, Honey, what's going on?\nRENEE DAVIES: Seth. We have some guests.\nSETH DAVIES: Hi.\nTYLER CARSON: Who the hell's this?\nPETER: It's about time for us to go, Tyler -- what do you say?\nTYLER CARSON: I think I see who's the problem here.\nPETER: Tyler... (against his will, he is forced to retrieve the pistol from Tyler's bag and aim it at Seth) Tyler, what are you doing?\nBROYLES: (to Olivia as they arrive at the house) You go in the back, I'll take the front. I need to disable Tyler now. No time to wait for Doctor Bishop. I'm going in. (breaks open the front door with stun gun leveled at the teen) Tyler, it's over! (shoots and stuns him. Tyler pulls the electrodes out and forces Peter to shoot Broyles)\nTYLER CARSON: We're outta here. And you're driving. (they leave thru the front)\nOLIVIA: (enters thru back and finds Broyles on the floor holding his bloody arm) Sir!\nBROYLES: He took Peter. Go after them.\nOLIVIA: Sir, we need to stop the bleeding.\nASTRID: (over radio) Agent Broyles, Doctor Bishop and I are approaching the house.\nBROYLES: The bullet went clean through, and I said go!\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir. (runs to the curb, finds Astrid and gets in the back of her sedan) Tyler just took off with Peter. Let's go.\nWALTER: (as he spys his station wagon turning a corner on residential street) Olivia, is that my car?\nASTRID: It's them. (pursues quickly)\nOLIVIA: (from the back seat) If we can disrupt Tyler's brainwaves, how close do we need to be?\nWALTER: No further than twenty feet, and the effect will only last a few seconds. (prepares and aims his brainwave gun) Ready.\nOLIVIA: Okay, do it. Do it now.\n(Walter aims and activates the device, Tyler begins to doze and Peter uses the momentary release from control to crash his father's car into a large pole)\nWALTER: (hovering over the unconscious Peter at the side of the road) Peter? Peter? Peter, Son... are you with me? Peter, Son...? (as Peter comes to) There you are. That was quick thinking. You always prove to be more resourceful than I give you credit for.\nPETER: (groggy) Is that supposed to be some sort of compliment? (looks over as the gurney being loaded into an ambulance) How's Tyler?\nWALTER: He was knocked unconscious in the crash. Probably a concussion. We gave him a sedative to make sure he stays under.\nPETER: (remembering) Agent Broyles.\nOLIVIA: See what happens when you get out from behind the desk?\nBROYLES: (as the paramedic finishess bandaging his arm) I've been shot before. First time by one of the good guys, though. Lucky for me you're a lousy shot.\nPETER: (approaching) The kid wanted to shoot you in the head. Lucky for you I was able to pull it off-center a bit. (pausing) You're gonna hold this over my head for a long time, aren't you?\nBROYLES: Somehow, you'll make it up to me.\nPETER: (on the phone) Okay, thanks, Olivia. Yeah, I'll tell Walter. (hangs-up)\nWALTER: (over the stove) Was I right? Did Tyler lose the power once the drug wore off?\nPETER: Yeah, you were right. Which is a good thing, I guess. That means he won't do any time. Kid goes on a killing spree, and all they're gonna do is make him talk it out with a bunch of shrinks.\nWALTER: (brings over a plate of food) How many do you want?\nPETER: I'm not hungry. I don't need any crepes.\nWALTER: Oh, don't be ridiculous. You were abducted. Of course you need crepes!\nPETER: I'm okay, Walter. (somber)\nWALTER: Whenever your mother made them, you called them creeps... drove her batty. She was a strong woman, your mother.\n(Nina sits comfortably in her office and types a message to William, on a thirty year-old computer monitor. Carson works in a lab and is reviewing developmental reports with photographs of several different Tylers in them, each report pairs a Tyler with a different Massive Dynamic scientist. Included is a report with he and his Tyler (#3). As Nina finishes her correspondence, Carson roles a gurney with Tyler #? on it behind closed doors)\nNINA: \"William, I don't know if you've been receiving these messages, but I continue to hope. I wanted to update you on the status of the Penrose-Carson experiments.One of the Tylers did, in fact, display a rather dramatic ability for mind control. But before we became aware of his ability, there were some unintended consequences. Among them, he was able to locate records of his surrogate mother, and, unfortunately, made a misguided attempt to reunite with her. In light of this, I am suspending the experiments indefinitely. You were right -- mind control is possible, given the right conditions. So despite the unfortunate circumstances, we can consider the project a success. As always, I hope this finds you in good health. Warmest Regards, Nina.\""

I've never seen anything like them before.\nAUGUST: They're from somewhere far away. (when offered an American Flag lapel pin) I don't have any money.\nPIN SELLER: Oh, that's okay. I'm gonna give you one of these anyway. There. Oh, that's great.\nAUGUST: Thank you. (August continues to observe then approaches a woman) Come with me, please.\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: Excuse me? What are you doing? Get off me! What are you doing? Help me. Help me. Hey! Let go. Help me.\nCONCERNED BYSTANDER: Hey, let her go.\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: Somebody help, please!\n(August shoots the man with his pulse gun)\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: Somebody. Help! Please help me. Help me. Please. Help me! Help. Somebody. (gasps)\nSECURITY MAN: Stop! Stop. (gunshot) (gunfire) (gun clicking) (car door shuts) (engine turns over) (wheels screeching)\nELLA: (waking Olivia from her nap on the couch) Morning.\nOLIVIA: (chuckles) Good morning, funny face. (sits up) You ready for our day?\nELLA: Yep. (hops and sits on the couch) This is the map mom left for us. Yep. There's four roller coasters.\nOLIVIA: Oh, no, no, no. We agreed. No roller coasters. You can go on any other ride you like, but no roller coasters, 'cause I am scared of the roller coasters. (making Ella giggle) Oh, you think that's funny? You think that that is funny?\nELLA: Okay, no roller coasters.\nOLIVIA: (Olivia laughs, then answers ringing cell phone) Dunham. Where? Uh, no, I'll tell Walter and Peter. (hangs-up. to Ella) So. We're gonna have to take a rain check.\nELLA: That's okay, Aunt Liv. I know you have an important job.\nOLIVIA: Well, I'm gonna call the Jacobson's. And see if they can babysit. And then I'll--\nELLA: Make pancakes?\nOLIVIA: Yes. (laughs and picks Ella off the ground to carry) and I'll make you pancakes.\nPETER: Are you sure it was him? (finishes dressing)\nOLIVIA: Uh, we don't have the security footage yet, But an eyewitness said that he was wearing a gray suit and a hat, quote - one of those old ones from the '60s.\nPETER: (sits to put on socks and shoes) You don't have any information on the girl?\nOLIVIA: No. The police showed her picture around the museum, But no one knew who she was. Hey, is Walter awake?\nPETER: (scoffs) oh, yeah. He's in -- (blender turns on) the kitchen. And talking to him is not gonna be easy.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nPETER: (walks to kitchen) Walter! We have company.\nWALTER: Oh, hello, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Walter, hey. (blender stops) I need you to tell me what you know about the man we call \"the Observer.\" You once referred to him as your friend. And it seems that he may have kidnapped a woman.\nWALTER: They call it \"the strawberry supreme.\"\nPETER: His favorite ice cream store shut down. He made me wait in line with him for four hours yesterday. Just so he could have one last milkshake.\nWALTER: They have a secret ingredient. (loading the blender with more ingredients) It's -- It's mundane but it's-- oh, it's sublime. And I am trying to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory senses to try to recreate it.\nOLIVIA: Walter? Can you come with me?\nOLIVIA: We've recorded him at over three dozen fringe events. (places photos in front of Walter) Do you remember him?\nWALTER: Of course. But there's nothing more than I told you before. Peter and I were in a car crash...\nPETER: ...in a frozen lake, when I was a boy.\nWALTER: We were drowning, And... He dove in and saved us. But you say he's kidnapped a woman?\nOLIVIA: We think he may have.\nPETER: Why? What are you thinking, Walter?\nASTRID: (enters from room) Hey, guys? The footage from the abduction has been downloaded. (Peter and Olivia follow her back to her computer) Also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum that had some kind of weird writing in it.\nOLIVIA: And they think it was his?\nASTRID: Well, they don't know, But Agent Broyles is sending it over.\nOLIVIA: Have we I.D.'d the victim?\nASTRID: No, not yet. (Walter joins them and they study security footage)\nOLIVIA: Wait a minute, Astrid. Can you zoom in? (Astrid types) Now freeze it. Peter, that isn't him. That's a different guy.\nPETER: There's more than one Observer. (to Astrid) Okay. Stop. Ho -- hold on. What just happened right there? (Astrid slows the footage)\nOLIVIA: Was he hit? (Astrid zooms in the focus of the security footage at the museum on the bald man. as he starts to enter his vehicle, he catches the bullet headed for his face with his fingertips)\nPETER: Who are these people?\n(inside a room at the quaint two story motel, Christine revives and August begins to tie her with rope to the footboard of the bed)\nCHRISTINE\/AUGUST: (synchronized) Please don't hurt me. Why are you doing this? Please let me go. I promise I won't tell anyone. You don't have to do this.\nAUGUST: To me.\nCHRISTINE\/AUGUST: (synchronized) Please.\nAUGUST: (ties a gag over her mouth) It will be safer if you stay quiet. (Christine begins to cry as August put on his hat and leaves)\nBROYLES: (sitting on a bench and looking through a file with Olivia) Her name's Christine Hollis. Twenty-seven years old in the Masters Program for Fine Arts at B.U. As far as we can tell, she's no one special. Her parents are deceased. No siblings, no arrest record. $2,700 in her bank account. Nothing unusual about her at all.\nOLIVIA: Well, do we have a home address?\nBROYLES: We're working on it now.\nOLIVIA: Assuming she's still alive.\nBROYLES: We have no reason yet to think otherwise.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's just it, isn't it? I mean, we don't know what to think. I -- I'm lost. Years ago, one of them saved Walter and Peter. Walter doesn't know why, or he can't remember. But beyond that, everything we know about these guys, the little that there is suggests that they just watch. They don't get involved. But now...\nBROYLES: Figure out why he took this girl. What makes her the exception. Do that, and I think you'll find him.\nPETER: (approaches with the notebook) Hey, I think we may have a lead on the Observer. Walter, look at this in his book. I think that might be blood.\nWALTER: You might be right, son. The scalpel, please.\nPETER: Did he ever tell you why he saved us? The Observer.\nWALTER: (hesitates) No. (takes the notebook and moves to another workstation)\nPETER: (follows Walter) We're close, Walter. Whatever's going on, whatever William Bell was warning Olivia about. These people have the answers, I know it. I can feel it.\nASTRID: (looking at her computer screen) This does not make any sense.\nPETER: (joins her) What?\nASTRID: His handwriting. So far, I have counted twelve hundred and forty-six distinct characters, and not a single one of them repeats.\nPETER: Alright. Not all of us majored in Linguistics.\nASTRID: It means that every written language is based on repetition. So without repeated symbols, language is not possible.\nPETER: Well, maybe it's a code.\n(Walter finds something in the notebook and keeps quiet)\nASTRID: Maybe. But if so, it is the most complicated code I have ever seen. The computer can't make any sense of this either.\nOLIVIA: (entering the lab) Hey, what you got?\nPETER: Nothing concrete on the symbols yet. But we found a blood sample in the book.\nOLIVIA: The kidnapper's blood?\nPETER: Not sure. Walter's analyzing it now.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: Well, we can't be certain until we run the labs, but I've noticed the blood has an orange tint, perhaps a sign of hemophilia.\nOLIVIA: Well, if it is his blood and if he's a hemophiliac, Then maybe he was treated in a hospital, so there could be a record.\nPETER: I'll call Broyles. Have him put together a list of all the known hemophiliacs in the area.\nASTRID: Hey, guys, I think I found something. It looks like someone else has been investigating these symbols too.\nOLIVIA: What? Who is it? (Olivia looks at Astrid's work)\nBRANDON: (exiting an elevator with Olivia and Peter in-tow) Yeah, these things have been blowing my mind for a while now. (to Olivia) Do you see the little half-circle with wings? That appears on a cuneiform tablet at the Iraqi National Museum. It's one of mankind's earliest attempts at writing. And, uh, do you see this little triangular curlicue thingy? That's etched on the Iiron Pillar of Delhi. 900, B.C. It's pretty weird, right? (turns to Peter) So Nina Sharp says you're FBI too. Uh... you don't look FBI.\nOLIVIA: (to Brandon) So you have no idea what any of them mean.\nBRANDON: What the symbols mean?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nBRANDON: No, I have no idea. But I found something else. (continues his briefing at a computer screen) We all remember Paul Revere's ride, \"one if by land, two if by sea,\" But before that, he was famous for his engraving of the Boston Massacre, 1770. (calls up a painted picture of the 1770 battle. a bald man is behind the ranks of Red Coats)\nPETER: Oh, come on.\nOLIVIA: Well, that could be anybody.\nBRANDON: (calls up another painting with a bald man at the peasant uprising) Marie Antoinette. 1793. (calls up an image of another bald man in the crowd) Sarajevo, 1914. Minutes before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot, kicking off World War I.\nOLIVIA: (a little befuddled) So they have been around forever.\nBRANDON: (earnestly) Or else they're not limited by our human perception of time. Are you with me? (initiates a simple demonstration) We think of time as linear, right? Life is a journey. You're born, and then you die. And to get from one end to the other, (connects a clear to tube to a container with water and spills the fluid through the straight tube) there's only one way through. (water splatters his shoes and the floor) Unless... you look at it like this... (fills tube and removes it from container, blocking both ends) and then... you can see at any point. It's all happening at once. (rotates tube around)\nOLIVIA: So they're traveling through time.\nBRANDON: No. It's more like they're observing time. (empties tube) I think these guys show up at important moments. Um, historical, technological, scientific. But it's rare. Maybe two dozen different definite occurrences in the past five thousand years of human history. But recently, I've charted twenty-six sightings in the past three months alone. It kind of makes you wonder.\nPETER: Why now?\nBRANDON: And what's about to happen?\nWAITRESS: (approaches the Observers table) More hot sauce, gentlemen?\nTHE OBSERVER: Thank you.\nWAITRESS: Sure thing. (leaves the sauce and departs as both Observers start to cover their meals with hot sauce)\nJULY: (arrives, removes hat, places it down with his briefcase then sits) We have a situation with August.\nDECEMBER: (studies images of August abducting a young woman) Who is she?\nJULY: I don't know. But she's supposed to be on Tropos Air, Flight 821.\nDECEMBER: Why did he abduct her?\nJULY: We don't know -- and the flight has already left the terminal.\nDECEMBER: Then he's created an irregularity. We'll need to repair it. (to The Observer) Contact Donald. (The Observer opens his communication device and starts pushing buttons)\n(Donald Long walks out of a market with a bag of groceries. His communication device activates and three green lights illuminate, followed by a red light. Long puts his groceries in the trunk of his vehicle and removes a bulky equipment case. Inside the vehicle he opens the case, activates the device and prepares his pistol with ammunition and a barrel silencer. The dot-matrix printer in his equipment case prints an image of Christine Hollis. He removes the document from the printer to take with him.)\n(standing and chatting as Peter walks around and inspects)\nDANIELLE: I just don't understand it. Why would anyone want to kidnap Christine?\nOLIVIA: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. So you two aren't roommates?\nDANIELLE: No. We're friends. Taking a bunch of sculpture classes together. I'm subletting her room while she's away, or was supposed to be away.\nOLIVIA: Where was she supposed to be?\nDANIELLE: Italy. She was supposed to fly today. She was going to spend the semester, studying ceramics in Rome.\nOLIVIA: Well, do you have a copy of her itinerary? Her flight to Rome, or maybe where she was gonna be staying?\nDANIELLE: She emailed me one. I can print out a copy for you.\nPETER: (holds out framed picture taken from the mantle) Is this Christine?\nDANIELLE: Yeah. It's a terrible story, actually. Her family was visiting relatives in San Francisco. A few hours after that photo was taken, there was a big earthquake.\nPETER: The one in '89?\nDANIELLE: They were driving on that bridge. When it happened, when it collapsed. Her parents were both killed. That's the last photo she has of them. I'll, um, get you her travel information. (leaves room)\nPETER: Take a look at this. Behind the father. (in the background of the photo, a bald man in a simple dark suit and Fedora hat is watching the Hollis family)\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: (struggles with the rope and her wrists and the footboard of the bed) Come on. (groans) Come on! (the wooden base of the bed splinters and she tumbles to floor, still gagged and bound. the door opens)\nAUGUST: (enters with a large bag of fast food) I thought you might be hungry. (helps her to a chair, removes the gag and examines her wrists) You've hurt yourself.\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: Why are you doing this? What do you want from me?\nAUGUST: (turns on the television) It would be easier to show you.\nTELEVISION ANNOUNCER: ...popularity polls continue to show huge support for the President as the economy rallies and terrorism declines. The poll found that 63% of Americans are happy with the president...\nAUGUST: It will be just a minute now.\nWOMAN ON TELEVISION: And believe he will continue find ways to improve the economy and generate new jobs.\nOLIVIA: (verbally activating her vehicles automatic dialing feature) Phone.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Phone. Please say a command.\nOLIVIA: Call the Jacobson's.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Calling the Jacobson's.\nPETER: (studying the 1989 Hollis picture) Whatever these Observers do to keep from aging, they should market it. They'd make a fortune.\nOLIVIA: So what does it mean, that he has been keeping tabs on this girl for twenty years?\nKEN JACOBSON: (on vehicle speaker phone) Hello?\nOLIVIA: Oh, Ken, hi. It's Olivia Dunham. I'm just calling to check in and say hi to my niece.\nKEN JACOBSON: Oh. Jane took her out for ice cream. You want me to call her and have her--\nOLIVIA: Uh, no, no, uh -- just let her know that I called.\nKEN JACOBSON: Sure thing. (ends call)\nPETER: Rachel's out of town?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. For the weekend.\nPETER: (reads her body language) And?\nOLIVIA: And what?\nPETER: You do that thing with your mouth when you're upset.\nOLIVIA: (snorts) Oh, Ella and I had this whole day at the amusement park planned, and then dinner after. She was completely understanding when I told her that I had to work. (pauses. remembers) When my mom took me to my first movie when I was six, I was so excited. She bought me a box of popcorn, and we took our seats. You know, they used to have that curtain before the movie started? It was this beautiful red velvet. We sat there eating popcorn. (giggles) And after a couple minutes, I turned to her and said, \"Mommy, this is the best movie ever.\" I didn't understand that it hadn't started. (pauses) It's one of my favorite memories of my mother.\nPETER: (sympathetic) Don't worry, you'll make plenty of memories with Ella.\nRADIO ANNOUNCER: ...new information on Tropos Air Flight 821, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean two hours outside Rome, Italy. The plane contained 211 passengers and six crew members, all of whom are assumed to be dead. Flight 821 departed...\nPETER: (studies Olivia again) What?\nRADIO ANNOUNCER: ...Logan International Airport at Ten-Forty-Five A.M. Eastern Standard Time, and was scheduled...\nOLIVIA: Okay, Christine's itinerary, it's just in my glove box.\nRADIO ANNOUNCER: ...to land at the Leonardo Da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport early this morning. The plane was in the air for just under...\nPETER: (reviews the itinerary) Flight 821. Boston to Rome. She was supposed to be on that flight.\nTELEVISION ANNOUNCER: ...rescue teams and divers continue to scour the wreckage. We will continue to bring you live coverage of this disaster as it comes across our desk. Representatives of Tropos Air...\nAUGUST: You were going to die.\nWOMAN ON TELEVISION: We will bring you live coverage just as soon as it happens. Right now, what you're--\nAUGUST: I saved you.\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: (sitting still. stunned) How did you--\nAUGUST: You're not safe. Yet. There is something I need to do. (stands) I have to go out. I would prefer not to gag you. (places gag in her mouth) But it is for your own protection. (ties gag and leaves)\nOLIVIA: (entering the lab together) What if he did? I mean, what if he somehow knew the plane was gonna crash?\nPETER: So you think this Brandon guy was right? That they can see the events before they happen.\nWALTER: (overhearing the details) I'm sorry, what plane crash?\nPETER: (to Walter) Christine Hollis was supposed to be on a plane that crashed just off the coast of Italy. Two hundred people were killed.\nWALTER: Oh, dear.\nOLIVIA: I mean, what if he wasn't trying to kidnap her? What if he was trying to save her life?\nPETER: What is so special about her? Why save her? Why did one of them save us?\nASTRID: (returning. hands over a piece of paper) Walter! I've got the results of the blood sample from the book.\nWALTER: Oh. Oh. (studies the paper. chuckles) High concentration of capsaicin, which means it's not blood at all, It's Chile pepper juice. He must have spilled some in the book.\nPETER: Well, that's great news. So we'll add messy to the A.P.B.\nWALTER: No, it is good news. Concentration at 970,000 on the Scoville Scale, that's one of the hottest Chile peppers there is. I hypothesize a Naga Jolokia from India, otherwise known as the King Cobra Chile. I once ate one. The flatulence was horrible. Very embarrassing.\nOLIVIA: Walter. Are these peppers sold in Boston?\nWALTER: Oh, I -- I imagine so. though I don't suspect one could grow them here.\nOLIVIA: Astrid?\nASTRID: Locate anyone who's importing those peppers locally. Got it.\n(August joins a group of Observers sitting and waiting for him)\nDECEMBER: (somewhat annoyed) Well. It appears you've been busy.\nDECEMBER: (to August, standing rigidly next to the table) Your actions took us all by surprise. I take it you've come here to explain yourself.\nAUGUST: Then you are aware of the plane crash.\nDECEMBER: Of course. Christine Hollis. Who is she?\nAUGUST: I have observed this woman for much of her life. She is unique.\nTHE OBSERVER: They are all unique. That is not reason to interfere with the course her life was meant to take.\nAUGUST: We have interfered before.\nTHE OBSERVER: Only to correct a mistake of our own making. She has no future.\nAUGUST: Then why do I see it? (looks at July) Why do I see that she is important?\nDECEMBER: Your perception must be in error.\nAUGUST: Perhaps.\nDECEMBER: Your oversight will be forgiven, But Miss Hollis must be corrected. We've already seen to it.\nPETER: You should eat something. (places a snack on the research papers at Olivia's desk)\nOLIVIA: Thanks. You know, if there's something significant about this girl, I just don't see it. After her parents died, she's taken in by her mother's best friend, who was a veterinarian in Worcester. She got decent grades in college, and interned at art galleries in the summer. I think she's just like anyone else.\nASTRID: (entering from lab) Hey, guys? I think I found something. There's King Cobra Chiles. Three Boston restaurants imported them last year, and one private citizen.\nPETER: Who?\nASTRID: I don't know. He paid with a money order. But we have an address. It's an apartment in Cambridge.\nOLIVIA: Well, can you give the address to Broyles and get him to have a back-up team standing by in case we need them?\nASTRID: (as Olivia and Peter prepare to leave the lab) Sure thing.\nWALTER: Taste this, please. (offers her a spoonful. watches her grimace) No. That's what I was afraid of.\nASTRID: Whoo-- what is that?\nWALTER: French vanilla ice cream and cough syrup. Well, no, no, you see-- I suspect that this-- The secret ingredient is wild cherries, and I didn't have any fresh cherries. Unless you'd make a trip to the market.\nASTRID: (succinctly) If I do, I am no longer your taste tester.\nWALTER: Ooh. Deal.\n(Astrid grabs her coat and heads to the exit. Walter watches her go then grabs his coat to leave)\n(Donald Long enters an apartment building, climbs the stairs to the second level, picks the lock on a Augusts' front door, then enters with his silenced pistol drawn. he closes the door and locks it behind him. he moves from room to room and studies what he finds. One wall has multiple photos of Hollis growing-up, and recent photos. another room has a pull-string toy monkey that bangs cymbals loudly)\n(Walter enters and looks to meet the man that sent him the coded message. he stands at the table, then sits to join him)\nAUGUST: You got my message. I suspected that a likeness of a nitrogen molecule would attract your attention.\nWALTER: (slightly intimidated) Please don't take my son. Your friend and I had a deal. We had an arrangement. I know what I did was wrong, but--\nAUGUST: (a little surprised) That is not why I contacted you. I need your help.\nWALTER: My help? (relieved) Well. In that case, I should call him. And Agent Dunham. They'll want to know I'm talking to you.\nAUGUST: I suspect that they might be occupied right now.\n(Peter and Olivia enter the building and head to Augusts' door. Long is still inside and finds a phone directory with a page of motel listings. Peter kicks open the door to the apartment and Olivia enters with her pistol leveled. Olivia is decoyed into the bathroom by the clacking sound of the pull-string toy. Peter snoops around and is ambushed by Long. the assassin puts the silenced pistol to the back of Peter's skull and whispers)\nDONALD LONG: On your knees. Down on the ground. (cocks the hammer on his pistol)\nPETER: Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. (quickly turns and hacks the assassin's gun hand away from his head)\n(Olivia hears the gun shot and the fist fight, then finds Peter uninjured. Long has departed the building and quickly vanished outside.\nWALTER: (sitting at a table near the windows) What is it that requires my help?\nAUGUST: I have interfered in the natural course of events. To correct that, the others will try to kill Christine Hollis until they succeed. If we run, they will find us. If I stop the assassin, they will send another. I cannot see any course of action that will prevent... (upset) her death.\nWALTER: (eager) What makes you think I can help?\nAUGUST: Because you have solved such a matter before. You saw beyond the limitations of your problems.\nWALTER: (confessing) Not really. I just missed my son. May I ask what is so important about Miss Hollis?\nAUGUST: I cannot explain the reason. I merely see it. I have never experienced such... certainty. But the others, they say she is of no consequence.\nWALTER: Well, in that case, if you cannot persuade the others of your conviction, then you must do something to prove it. You must make her important. And of course whatever you do, you must be prepared to face the consequences.\nPETER: (after checking a closet full of suits and shirts) The gunman leave a trail? (checks the bump on his skull)\nOLIVIA: No. I called in his description to the P.D., but I expect he's long gone by now. Broyles is sending in a CSU team to dust this place for fingerprints.\nPETER: Well, I doubt he's gonna show up on any database at least none from this century.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nPETER: What that guy Brandon said about them being around for a long time. (holds up an old newspaper that was stacked on the floor) 1884, apparently it was a great year for blubber. (displays a headline about a predicted record year for whaling)\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: (after August returns to the room and removes her gag) What? What is it? (kneels before her and removes the ropes from her wrists)\nAUGUST: Do you... trust me?\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: (honestly) Yes.\nAUGUST: Then you must do exactly... as I say.\nAGENT: (to other CSU technicians combing the apartment) So far, we just pulled two off the door. We got a possible match over here.\nOLIVIA: (looking at numerous old newspaper articles attached to the wall) Any ideas?\nPETER: What are they looking for? We're looking for them, but they're looking for something too. That's why they keep on showing up. So what are they looking for?\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham. Where? (to Peter) Someone just called in a description of in our second Observer. He was spotted at a motel in Lowell. (they leave)\n(the assassin arrives in his vehicle after dark. he grabs his pistol and exits the car. the page from the phone directory rests on the passenger seat. half the motels have been crossed-off. Long kicks open the door to the room Hollis has been held in and sees the ropes from her wrists on the floor. he suspects someone is hiding in closet and aims pistol at it. August bursts from the closet and fires his pulse weapon before Long can fire his pistol. Long is hit and flies backward into the door frame. August holster his weapon and leaves immediately. Seconds later, Long gets up, groggy from the blast and leaves to follow August. August believes he is being followed so turns and aims his weapon at the stairwell. Long sticks his out from behind the corner of the building and August fires, hitting a motel sign as Long ducks back around the corner)\nDONALD LONG: (catches-up in the parking lot and levels his weapon) What are you doing? Tell me where she is. Just tell me where she is. You know I'm just trying to do my job. I have no quarrel with you. (August looks at an approaching car)\nDONALD LONG: You insane?\nAUGUST: (raises his weapon again and points it at Long) Good-bye. (takes three bullets to the chest. Olivia exits her car and takes cover behind a vehicle parked next to her)\nOLIVIA: FBI!\n(Olivia and Donald Long exchange gunshots. Olivia grunts. August grabs Peter's hand and gives him the gun. Olivia hears overhead footsteps. Peter shoots at Donald Long. Olivia shoots him twice. Donald Long falls down)\nOLIVIA: Christine Hollis? Christine? Christine Hollis? Christine. I'm Agent Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI. It's gonna be alright.\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: What about the man? The one who took me.\nOLIVIA: Let's get you home.\n(August and The Observer drive from the motel)\nAUGUST: Will she be safe now?\nTHE OBSERVER: Who is she? Why did you save her?\nAUGUST: I saw her many years ago. She was a child. Her parents had just been killed. She was crying. But she... she was brave. She crossed my mind... Somehow. She never left it. I think... it's what they call... feelings. I think... I love her. Will she be safe now?\nTHE OBSERVER: Yes. You made her important. She is responsible for the death of one of us.\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: So who was he? How am I supposed to make sense of any of this? Him - the plane - the guy who came after us.\nPETER: Did he say anything to you? Anything? Did he tell you why he saved you?\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: No.\nWALTER: He... he asked me to give you something. The bald man... in the event that he couldn't. (hands her a toy from her childhood)\nCHRISTINE HOLLIS: (smells stuffed toy) My dad... won this for me playing skee-ball. I was holding on to it in the backseat when the bridge collapsed.\nWALTER: Christine. I think you'll be safe now.\nPETER: (in the hallway after the chat with Christine) Hmm? When did you see The Observer? And why didn't you tell me?\nWALTER: What do you mean? I just did tell you.\nPETER: That's not good enough. We are so close. I can't let these guys get away again. They have the answers. I know they do.\nWALTER: Don't worry Son. You will get your answer. Why don't we go for a long drive together? Perhaps to pick up a tutti frutti milkshake.\nBROYLES: The man you shot was named Donald Long. Ballistics tied his gun to six unsolved homicides up and down the East Coast. The earliest one dates back ten years.\nOLIVIA: An assassin.\nBROYLES: Maybe.\nOLIVIA: Well, do we know who hired him this time?\nBROYLES: We don't know. Nothing in his car, or on his person gave any indication.\nOLIVIA: What about The Observer's gun?\nBROYLES: Our techs had never seen anything like it. They can't seem to make it fire. The best we can figure, Peter shot off the last round. There's one more thing. The tip-off that The Observer was spotted at the motel, it was called in from one of the motel phones.\nOLIVIA: What if he was trying to protect Christine? And if he realized he couldn't do it on his own?\nBROYLES: Yeah. That's what I thought.\nOLIVIA: If it's okay with you, I -- I'd like to take the rest of the day off.\nBROYLES: Sure. Big plans?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nELLA: Don't worry, Aunt Liv. (as the roller coaster reaches a highpoint) I'll hold your hand. (giggles)\nOLIVIA: You'd better.\nELLA: Oh, I'm not gonna-- no, no, no, no! (laughing then screaming as the roller coaster accelerates)\nDECEMBER: (standing near the ride and watch the two. to The Observer) Look how happy she is. It's a shame things are about to get so hard for her."

Will you take me to Ping-On Street?\nWOMAN: (in Cantonese. hesitant) You want to go to Ping-On Street? (points over his shoulder) Go down... just there...\n(he presses on his way through the noisy night, finds the address he is looking for and rings the intercom. he is buzzed in)\nWU LAN: (accepting a warming blanket. in Cantonese) Did any of the others make it?\nMING CHE: (in Cantonese) You are the first.\nWU LAN: They're dead. They're all dead.\nMING CHE: Wait until the morning. There may be hope. You may stay here with me, my friend. (he escorts the man into a large bunk room in the basement) There is running water. A toilet there. I will get you dry clothes... and something to eat. You can lie down here.\nWU LAN: My stomach hurts.\nMING CHE: Your stomach? You should lie down.\nWU LAN: My stomach hurts...\nMING CHE: Lie down. Lie down and rest.\nWU LAN: (severely distressed) Help me! What is happening to me?! (crying) It hurts... it hurts... my stomach.\n(as the man screams repeatedly, Che dons heavy gloves and brandishes large shears. he cuts the shirt from the man's chest to witness his abdomen - distended and wriggling about. a large squid-like parasite crawls out of Lan's mouth and Che retrieves it)\nPETER: (getting out the station wagon and approaching Olivia) Sorry I'm late.\nOLIVIA: Where's Walter?\nPETER: He's practicing some self-actualization.\nOLIVIA: In a taxi?\nPETER: Yeah, that's part of it. He's also cooking for himself now, cleaning up after himself. You should have him tell you why picking out his own wardrobe is an important sign of independence. So how many are there? Is it bad?\nOLIVIA: Did you eat?\nPETER: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's unfortunate.\nWALTER: (approaching from the nearby parking area) Hello, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Hello, Walter.\nPETER: You made it. (summoning him as he strolls past) Walter!\nWALTER: (ired) I saw you following the taxi in the station wagon.\nPETER: I wasn't following you, Walter. We were coming to the same place.\nWALTER: You don't trust me.\n(on the rocky shoreline of the inlet to the bay, the team walks among the bodies that litter the area, and are briefed by the boss)\nBROYLES: It's a Chinese merchant ship registered in Hong Kong. Four hours ago, it ran aground and caught fire. Strong current, freezing water. They died attempting to swim ashore. We pulled out twenty-seven bodies so far. At first, it appeared they all died of hypothermia. And then we found these. (to an officer at work gathering evidence) Excuse us, agent. (to Walter, about a body with a large squid-like creature in its' mouth) Doctor Bishop, have you ever seen anything like this?\nWALTER: It's similar to a tiny parasite found in livestock. I've never seen them this size, or in humans. (grabs it and pulls the two foot long parasite from the throat of the corpse. to Peter, trying to hand him the parasite) I want this creature transported back to my lab. It might still be alive.\nNEARBY AGENT: (pulling Mei Lin from the water and calling for assistance) Hey, this woman's still breathing!\nWALTER: (rushing to help with the rest of the team) Step aside please. We haven't much time. She's infected. (clearing the woman's mouth of obstructions) We've got to get this organism out of her.\nPARAMEDIC: (to others lifting the unconscious woman) Go!\n(bodies, bloodied at the mouth, lay still on several tables in a makeshift operating room. the large parasites are being collected alive by Che and placed in barrels of fluid)\nMING CHE: (to the newest refugee to find his door) Here. Before you get sick. (wraps a blanket around the shoulders of the wet man)\nSECOND MAN: (shivers) The boat. There was an accident. Did any of the others come?\nMING CHE: No. You're the first. (lying)\nTAO CHEN: (walking the corridor to the patient's room) My name's Tao Chen. I'm from the Chinese Consulate.\nPETER: The woman we pulled from the water, how long has she been awake?\nTAO CHEN: About an hour.\nOLIVIA: Is she talking?\nTAO CHEN: Just a little. Her name is Mei Lin. She's from outside of Hong Kong.\nPETER: She happen to mention how she got a gigantic worm stuck in her stomach?\nTAO CHEN: Doctor said she just had a severe case of dehydration. No worm.\nOLIVIA: She wasn't infected?\nMEI LIN: (sitting in her bed she explains her situation, in Cantonese)\nTAO CHEN: (translating) She says they came for work and a better life.\nMEI LIN: (asks a question)\nPETER: (answers her in Cantonese. then translates for Olivia) She asked if we're gonna arrest her. I told her we're just here to help.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) I didn't know you spoke Cantonese.\nPETER: (to Olivia) Well get to know me a bit.\nTAO CHEN: (asks a question in Cantonese)\nMEI LIN: (answers the question)\nTAO CHEN: (translates) She says she doesn't know. The men on the boat -- they knew.\nMEI LIN: (explains further)\nTAO CHEN: (translates) They gave her medicine for seasickness. Everyone got it. But her father was a fisherman -- so she was used to the sea -- so she didn't take it. (speaking foreign language)\nMEI LIN: (cries, talks and looks at a photo of her husband and daughter)\nTAO CHEN: She wants you to help her find her daughter and husband. She -- she doesn't know what happened to her family.\nMEI LIN: (continues her story)\nTAO CHEN: (translates) Crewmen said they were two days behind on another boat.\nOLIVIA: There's another boat?\nPETER: Yeah, so chances are they're infected too.\nOLIVIA: Okay, that gives us maybe thirty-six hours before it lands.\nASTRID: (helping a specimen onto and off of a weight scale) Seven pounds and ten ounces. Walter, this is our largest worm yet.\nWALTER: Parasitic worm to be precise. Truly, Agent Farnsworth, it never ceases to amaze me the infinite variation that Mother Nature gives us. She truly has quite a disturbing sense of humor.\nASTRID: Considering your new pet, I think Mother Nature's a real bitch. (door closes)\nPETER: (entering with Olivia) How's it going in here?\nASTRID: (sarcastically joking) You mean here at Bishop's Live Bait?\nPETER: Actually, I think these things would scare off the fish, don't you?\nOLIVIA: Walter, we spoke to the woman we found on the beach and she said that everyone on that boat took some sort of... capsule medicine.\nPETER: Actually, Mei Lin's the only one who didn't take the capsule and she's the only one who didn't get affected. So do you think it's possible that that could've been inside the capsule?\nWALTER: Of course. It makes perfect sense. (as he dissects a specimen) If the time of gestation is equal to the time of transport, it would explain why the creatures need the host. These bodies provide nutrition, warmth, and protective shelter. They enable the parasite to grow.\nPETER: Are you saying that these people were used as some sort of human incubator?\nWALTER: Quite ingenious, really. And yes to your question. It is possible for the larvae of the parasite to fit into a capsule. It would allow the parasite to grow on the journey here.\nOLIVIA: Which leaves why? Why would someone be smuggling these in? (looks at her beeping pager) It's Broyles. The Coast Guard found a manifest on the sunken Chinese ship. They traced it to a local shipyard. Somebody is in custody now.\nPETER: (leaves with Olivia) Hey, Walter, find out everything else you can on those worms, alright?\nWALTER: Parasitic worms.\n(at his makeshift lab, Ming Che harvest body parts from the recovered parasitic worms. he pours a fine powder into a paper wrapper, folds the paper around it and seals the package with a label)\nBROYLES: (standing in the observation area talking to Olivia and Peter, he shares what he has learned about the Triad thug handcuffed in the adjacent room) We found him at the shipyard where the boat was supposed to dock. He had just finished burning every document in the place. We're letting him sweat before we question him.\nPETER: He's not gonna talk. He's a triad gang member. They've got a strict code of honor.\nBROYLES: Triad? You sure?\nPETER: Yeah, his whole biography's written on him in ink. He's like a decorated soldier. See the mark on his arm there - the Extra Powerful Hook - that means he's killed five people. (jokingly) He also enjoys Broadway shows, long walks on the beach. (joke over) The one on his neck, it says Sun Hong Triad.\nOLIVIA: Sun Hong is known for smuggling heroin out of the Golden Triangle, not trafficking people.\nBROYLES: Then they're expanding their business.\nPETER: What if Sun Hong Triad are still dealing in narcotics?\nOLIVIA: How's that?\nPETER: Walter said these people were implanted with the worm on purpose. That seems to imply that they're valuable, right? Certain species of parasite have been known to naturally secrete opiates. If someone had figured out how to harvest those...\nBROYLES: You think those worms are some kind of new street drug?\n(the thug pulls a razor blade from the roof of his mouth)\nOLIVIA: (racing into the nearby room) He's got a razor blade!\nBROYLES: (on his handheld radio) This is Broyles! We have a code blue in Interview Three. We need security and paramedics immediately.\nOLIVIA: (enters the room to find that the criminal has slit his own throat) Oh. Oh!\nPETER: (trying to place pressure on the twelve inch wound as the man falls forward) Ah!\nWALTER: (handling an active parasite, with assistance) If only all parasitic worms were full of narcotics. Careful, careful! Not too deep.\nASTRID: (trying to inject the creature) I got it, Walter. Just... hold still.\nWALTER: Well, given the high cost of transporting the creature, it must be quite a high.\nASTRID: Walter, you are not smoking this thing.\nWALTER: Ah. Now that should do the trick.\nASTRID: Yeah?\nWALTER: Now with some luck, we'll find the active ingredient. (as the creature latches onto his arm) Oh!\nASTRID: Oh, my God. Walter.\nWALTER: (as the parasite settles) No, no, no. Wait, wait. The initial feeling is quite something. (grunts)\nASTRID: Walter, this thing is feeding on you.\nWALTER: This is -- this is -- this is rather pleasant.\nASTRID: Ah! (as she peels it off his arm)\nWALTER: (looking up to find a dismayed visitor) Agent Broyles, I didn't see you there.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop. Agent Farnsworth. Where can I find Agent Dunham?\nASTRID: (flustered) Uh, she's in the back with Peter. Sir.\nOLIVIA: (over a desk of research talking to Peter) So the question is if there is a black market for this drug, then who's buying it? (as Broyles enters) Sir.\nBROYLES: (hands her a file) That's everything the Bureau has on the Sun Hong triad. There's also information on the triad's suspected leader. He goes by the name of John Hsu. His present whereabouts are unknown.\nOLIVIA: These are corporate bank documents.\nBROYLES: Shell companies to shield his criminal activity.\nPETER: What about the boat carrying Mei Lin's family? Any word?\nBROYLES: Nothing. The Coast Guard has begun boarding and searching all vessels coming into New England. Two hundred ships by the count. No small task.\nPETER: More like a needle in a haystack. So we have about twenty hours before the worms come out.\nOLIVIA: There was a wire two weeks ago from a bank here in Boston. It looks like a private account in Beacon Hill transferred $500,000 paid into Beijing Executive Construction.\nPETER: Two weeks ago is about the same time the traffickers left Kowloon.\nBROYLES: Sounds like someone's financing those shipments.\nPETER: (pulling-up to a nice house in an affluent neighborhood) So this is where the other end of a triad bank wire leads.\nOLIVIA: Not what I pictured either. (as the front door is opened) Hi. Are your parents home?\nMATT JARVIS: Who are you?\nPETER: We're the FBI. Who are you?\nMATT JARVIS: I'm Matt. Um, can I see like, a badge? (checks Olivia's credentials) Mom, some FBI people are here! (casual. polite) Come on in.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: (sitting with Olivia in the living room as Peter saunters nearby) As my financial advisor explained it to me, there was money to be made in Beijing construction projects. I invested a half a million dollars with this company.\nOLIVIA: Did you ever meet a man named John Hsu? He was the head of the company you invested in.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: No. Never.\nOLIVIA: Maybe your husband then.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: He passed away shortly after Matt was born.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: (unaware that Peter is snooping) Did I do something wrong?\nOLIVIA: We suspect Mister Su of running a smuggling ring - trafficking Chinese nationals into the U.S., and using these front corporations to fund it.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: Oh, my God. I had no idea. I swear to both of you, my attorney reviewed all the documents and he assured me it was a sound investment.\nOLIVIA: These corporations look legitimate from the outside. May we have the name and number of your attorney? We'll need to ask him a few questions. (Peter eyeballs some clues)\nELIZABETH JARVIS: Of course. I'm sure he'd be as surprised by this as I am. If I can do anything to help...\nOLIVIA: Thank you. (standing to leave) We appreciate it.\n(the two leave the house and head back to the car)\nOLIVIA: What were you doing in there? Checking for dust?\nPETER: Not sure yet.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I want to stop by the hospital... check on Mei Lin.\nPETER: Okay. You drop me at the lab first?\nOLIVIA: (as they reach the car) Sure.\nPETER: (returns and approaches his father) Walter, what do you think the connection is between an excessive compulsive germaphobe and our worms? (sees Walter's new choice of shoes) Nice kicks.\nWALTER: Thank you. That's an excellent question. I have a theory.\nPETER: (notices four large punctures on Walter's forearm) What happened to you?\nASTRID: Your father got bitten by that thing and he refuses to get it checked out. (approaches the duo) Walter, what if you're infected with one of those worms?\nWALTER: I've tested my blood and liver function. I'm fine. In fact, my white cell count is through the roof, I have several new antibodies in my blood, and even the gas I had is gone.\nPETER: And you think it's the worm that did all that to you?\nWALTER: The creature, Peter, is not an illicit narcotic at all. It's medicine. (bluntly) Astrid, the picture. Show Peter, please.\nASTRID: (sitting with Peter at a computer monitor) Ancylostoma Duodenale. An intestinal hookworm. It's about ten millimeters long.\nWALTER: Chinese medicine. Ancylostoma could be used for the treatment of chronic asthma. People are purposefully infected and walk around their entire lives with it.\nPETER: Well, what does that have to do with our parasites?\nWALTER: Our parasites are a new species... bio-engineered from this hookworm.\nPETER: You mean somebody made these.\nWALTER: Designed them to grow in humans. In fact, I don't believe that they could grow anywhere else. I believe that it's the parasite's lymph gland that is the real prize. It secretes a remarkable immune-boosting enzyme.\nPETER: Immune-boosting? So you might take that if you had, say, a severe phobia of germs.\nWALTER: Or if you wanted to treat any number of immune deficiency disorders.\nPETER: Going somewhere, Walter?\nWALTER: (dressing to depart) I am. The phone book lists five herbalists in Chinatown, three of which sell our Ancylostoma Hookworm for the treatment of asthma. I am going to collect samples for genetic comparison.\nPETER: Why don't you give me those addresses? I'll go check them out.\nWALTER: You don't believe I can do it. Well, I can. (admonishing) Don't you dare follow me. (returns. humble) Can I please borrow some change for the bus fare?\nOLIVIA: (showing photos of the triad thug and his tattoo) Miss Lin, do you recognize these?\nTAO CHEN: (translates the question for Mei Lin)\nMEI LIN: (replies)\nTAO CHEN: (translates for Olivia) She said the man who put them on the fishing boat had one. What does it mean?\nOLIVIA: It's a gang tattoo. We think that the gang may be using people to smuggle drugs into the country.\nTAO CHEN: (translates for Mei Lin)\nMEI LIN: (comments. holds out image of her family)\nTAO CHEN: (starts to translate for Olivia) She said her husband and her daughter...\nOLIVIA: (interrupts) ...I think I understand. (looks into Mei Lin's eyes) We will do everything that we can.\n(in a crowded cargohold, refugees sleep. Mei Lin's daughter tells her father that she doesn't feel well. he calms her and tells her to sleep. somberly she looks around, plays with her toy bird, watches a nearby man sleep and snore. his abdomen becomes grossly distended. something inside him writhes. her eyes go wide open)\nOLIVIA: (just returning) Where is everybody?\nPETER: Uh, Walter's out self-actualizing again. Astrid's keeping an eye on him.\nOLIVIA: (looks at the monitor with medical air filtration data) What's this?\nPETER: You remember at Elizabeth Jarvis' house you asked me what I was looking at? Did you see all those hand sanitizers?\nOLIVIA: No.\nPETER: All the windows were hermetically sealed. Hepa filters. Oxygen tanks.\nOLIVIA: You saw oxygen tanks?\nPETER: Well, no. But I'm sure they're there somewhere.\nOLIVIA: Okay, and if they were?\nPETER: Walter says that these worms boost the immune system, right? If you're buying hand sanitizer in bulk and hermetically sealing all your windows, you're either Howard Hughes or you're actually sick.\nOLIVIA: Okay, let's go pick up Elizabeth Jarvis and get a warrant to search her house.\nPETER: Actually, I've got a better idea.\nPETER: (catching the teen shooting hoops in front of his house) Bend your knees more.\nMATT JARVIS: What are you doing here?\nOLIVIA: We wanted to ask you a couple questions about your mother.\nMATT JARVIS: Yeah, well, she's not here right now. And I know that I don't have to answer any of your questions without my mom or lawyer here.\nPETER: Then you can just talk to me. I'm not actually an FBI agent. Just a couple of guys hanging out on the court.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna go make a phone call. I have to go talk to a judge about a warrant. (she walks off)\nPETER: (returns the ball) There you go. I know you don't want to talk to us 'cause you're just trying to protect your mother, Matt. She's your only family. I understand that. I've been there.\nMATT JARVIS: Hmm. I doubt it.\nPETER: I was raised by my mother too. It's scary. You're worried that if you lose her, then you have no one. But those people that your mother gave money to, they're scary people. We're investigating them and that's not gonna stop. They're gonna try to cover their tracks. (softly) I want to make sure that your mother isn't one of those tracks.\nMATT JARVIS: You think that could happen?\nPETER: I need you to tell me then... - Is your mom sick? What is it? She has some sort of immune deficiency disorder?\nMATT JARVIS: No. (reveals scar on ribs) The treatments are for me.\n(Walter has been visiting herbalists. he exists one shop, extracts his list to determine his next stop and sees his lab partner nearby)\nWALTER: Agent Farnsworth.\nASTRID: Walter, what a... what a coincidence.\nWALTER: (somewhat upset) It's not a coincidence at all. You were following me. Peter had you follow me.\nASTRID: (lying poorly) No. I have a... I have a friend that lives right down... by the, uh... the Chinese restaurant. (gives-up on her lie) Walter. We're worried about you.\nWALTER: Does it occur to you that perhaps I want to be alone? That perhaps I want to live my life with a semblance of dignity and self-respect? If I want to go get a hot dog, so be it. I may go grocery shopping. I may even join a gym.\nASTRID: Walter. (sincerely) I'm sorry.\nWALTER: Well, since you're here, you may as well accompany me to the next herbalist on my list. But as a friend, not a supervisor.\nASTRID: Agreed, Walter.\nWALTER: (delighted) I love Chinatown. (chuckles as the two march off)\nOLIVIA: (standing below an elevated roadway, the duo shares what it has learned) Matt Jarvis suffers from a rare immune deficiency disorder. His body doesn't produce enough white blood cells to fight off infection.\nPETER: Yeah, technically speaking, this kid should be living in a giant plastic baggie. But we just shot hoops with him this afternoon.\nBROYLES: So these parasites are being harvested to treat his condition.\nPETER: Well, from what he says, they insert a medicinal powder directly into his spleen. Walter thinks the medicine's made out of a gland inside the worm.\nOLIVIA: So Matt's usually treated once a month. His next surgery is due in two days, right on schedule with when the next boat's due to arrive.\nBROYLES: Does the surgeon have a name?\nOLIVIA: Doctor Che.\nWALTER: (over a basket of wiggling worms) Ancylostoma Duodenale. Hookworm. Aren't they magnificent?\nASTRID: At this size, maybe.\nWALTER: Quite right. You haven't seen anything \u2018til you've seen one of these four feet long. (catching Ming Che's ear) What do I owe you?\nMING CHE: That'll be fifteen dollars, please. (very suspicious)\nASTRID: I got this.\nWALTER: No, It's okay. I have just enough money left. (empties wallet) Thank you. (hands over cash) Good day. (leaves with Astrid)\n(Che immediately dials on cell phone. A triad thug steps into the busy street listening to his cell phone, just as the Observer walks by)\nWALTER: (standing in front of a street vendor's cart waiting for two servings) I'm going to enjoy this. Provided, of course, the beans have been properly soaked to leech toxicity.\nASTRID: (not looking forward to her serving) For the record, I wanted ice cream.\nWALTER: Oh, look. Lacquered cricket boxes. (wanders away behind Astrid)\nSTREET VENDOR: You want Omega-3? I put in fish head.\nASTRID: Um, no, I will pass. Thank you. Walter. Here you go. Walter. (he is nowhere to be seen) Walter.\nBROYLES: Given what her kid said, I want you to lean on Elizabeth Jarvis. We're running out of time before that boat arrives.\nPETER: (answer ringing phone) So... how much rice candy did Walter eat?\nASTRID: (calling. upset. still on the busy street) I lost him. I turned my back for one second and he wasn't there any more. I -- I've looked for him everywhere, Peter.\nWALTER: Did he know that you were following him?\nASTRID: Yeah, he did at first... and he was fine with it. But he lulled me into a false sense of security...\nPETER: ...just so he could ditch you. Well, you know how he likes to prove a point. (sighs) He's got plenty of change for the bus. He's got his travel kit on him. All his emergency numbers. He should be fine. He's got to learn how to cross the street by himself sometime.\nASTRID: Okay. Okay, I'm gonna -- gonna head back to the lab and see if he's there, okay?\nASTRID: (enters the lab. anxious) Walter. (looks around) Walter. (searches the inner offices) Walter. (hears noises in the lab. sees triad thugs recovering the parasites they smuggled. she is approached by one thug)\n(Walter is busy at a public payphone. he is repeatedly failing to make contact with his son)\nUNKNOWN MAN: (on his end of the call) Hello.\nWALTER: Hello, Peter? It -- it -- it's Walter, your father.\nUNKNOWN MAN: Wrong number. (hangs-up)\nWALTER: (trying to call again) He -- hello, Peter. It's me, Walter, your father. (non-English reply) Excuse me? (ringing on the line)\nUNKNOWN WOMAN: (on her end of the call) Hello.\nWALTER: I \u2013 I - I fear I may have dialed the wrong number again. My name is Walter -- (line clicks off. no more change in his pocket, he takes a seat at the bus stop and Forrest Gump's his way into a conversation with Fao, a gentle lady nearly his age. she studies his somber mood) The number five bus hasn't stopped here for over two hours. Not that it matters. I used up all my bus fare to dial seven wrong numbers.\nFAO: (comments politely in Cantonese)\nWALTER: Can't remember Peter's number. It's got three 5s, a 1, a 0, two 7s. (nearly in tears) But for the life of me, I can't remember the correct sequence.\nPETER: (to young Farnsworth as she lay unconscious on the floor of the lab strewn with broken glass and damaged equipment) Astrid. Astrid. I think she's coming to.\nOLIVIA: Astrid. Astrid. What happened?\nASTRID: Ooh.\nPETER: I'm gonna call you an ambulance. (starts to dial)\nASTRID: No. Don't. I'm okay, Peter. (sits up groggily with a bloodied lip and scalp laceration) I'm okay. I don't need an ambulance.\nPETER: Who did this to you?\nASTRID: I don't know. It was, uh, two big Asian guys with tattoos.\nOLIVIA: Triad.\nASTRID: I don't know how they knew we had the worm.\nPETER: They must've followed you back from Chinatown. (answers cell phone) Hello. Walter Bishop - hai. (in Cantonese... this is Peter Bishop... etc... to caller. then to Olivia and Astrid) It's Walter. He's down in Chinatown. Apparently he's fine. (finishes with caller) Astrid, you sure you're okay? (leaves the lab) I'm going down to pick him up.\nOLIVIA: I'm going to talk to Elizabeth Jarvis. (to Peter) Let's stay in touch.\nPETER: You got it.\nOLIVIA: (following her into the kitchen) Mrs. Jarvis, we know you're withholding information.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: I already told you everything.\nOLIVIA: Actually, your son told us everything.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: I can't help you, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: I've got two dozen Chinese nationals dead, a federal agent assaulted, and another boat with God knows how many people about to die on it.\nELIZABETH JARVIS: You don't understand. This treatment... Matt won't live long without it.\nOLIVIA: We rescued a Chinese woman. Her daughter is on that other boat. She's gonna die too. Who's been treating your son?\nPETER: (knocks loudly and announces himself in Cantonese and, once the door is open, asks) Is my father here?\nFAO: (in Cantonese) Come in please. He has been waiting for you. Come in.\nWALTER: (sitting at a table in a silk robe) Peter. Hello, my son. Allow me to introduce you. My hostess's name is Fao.\nFAO: (in Cantonese) He could not remember your number correctly. We made many calls until we reached you.\nPETER: Walter, the numbers are in your pocket. How many times have I told you that? I put them there. Don't you remember that?\nWALTER: No. No, I don't.\nPETER: Walter, you -- you just -- Are you okay?\nWALTER: Yes. Yes, I'm fine.\nFAO: (in Cantonese. smiling. to Peter) Certainly I do not let strangers into my home. But he seemed very upset.\nWALTER: (standing, with his folded clothes in his hands. graciously. bows to Fao) The noodles are delicious. You really should try them, Peter.\n(on the sidewalk outside the apartment, as they leave)\nWALTER: Hope I didn't cause Agent Farnsworth too much distress.\nPETER: No, she had other things on her mind. Wouldn't happen to remember any of the addresses of those herbalist shops you visited, would you?\nWALTER: Certainly not. That's -- that's why I held on to this. (pulls list from pocket) Uh, uh, Astrid only went to me -- with me to the -- the third one, Ming Che's. They had quite a selection of hookworms. Although I confess I exaggerated a bit when I told them that ours was four foot long.\nPETER: You told someone we have a four foot worm?\nWALTER: It's not even two feet.\nPETER: That's how they followed Astrid. Ming Che on Ping-On Street.\nWALTER: (concerned) What do you mean? Astrid was followed?\nPETER: (answers cell phone) Bishop.\nOLIVIA: Hey, is Walter alright?\nPETER: Yeah, he's fine. Where are you?\nOLIVIA: The boat with Mei Lin's family on it just docked. Elizabeth Jarvis gave us a phone number. We tracked a few shore-to-ship calls off that. We're just about to commence the raid.\nPETER: Okay. I got another lead I'm tracking down.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Well, I'll call you after.\nPETER: Bye. (ends call)\nWALTER: (more concerned. nervous) Peter. Peter, what do you mean Astrid was followed?\nPETER: Just get in the car, Walter. I'll tell you later.\n(the tactical raid team screeches to an arrival just as the frieghter is being secured to the piering and the vessel is boarded, searched and siezed)\nCHAOS: (during the boarding) Move... move... move... move! Clear. Get down!\nBROYLES: (once aboard) I want a search bow to stern. Clear the lower decks. Find these people. You three with me.\n(as Olivia and her squad head into the cargohold, weapons drawn)\nTAC RADIO #1: Upper deck clear.\nTAC RADIO #2: Main deck's clear.\nTAC RADIO #3: Top deck's clear.\nTAC RADIO #1: Copy.\n(below decks in the very simple quarters, Olivia finds no refugees, just a child's toy... a bird)\nBROYLES: (from the gangway above) Agent Dunham. There are no trafficked people on this ship.\nOLIVIA: But there were. We're just too late.\nWALTER: (to Peter, as he parks near the herbalists shop late in the evening) Why are we stopping here?\nPETER: Is this the place?\nWALTER: Yes, but I need to get back to the lab. I need to check on Agent Farnsworth.\nPETER: She's alright, Walter. (noticing a panel van nearby begins to empty of refugees, headed into the store. his cell phone buzzes)\nOLIVIA: (on phone from the docks) Peter. Yeah, we had the right vessel, but they were already gone.\nPETER: Yeah. I know. They're here. I just saw them get unloaded through the alley.\nOLIVIA: Where are you?\nPETER: We're at a Chinese herbalist shop Ping-On street. Astrid was followed back to the lab from here.\nOLIVIA: We're on our way. (hangs-up)\nPETER: Okay, Walter. I need you to stay here. Olivia and Broyles are on their way.\nWALTER: Uh, no. This is not a good idea, son.\nPETER: I'll be careful. Stay in the car. (Walter locks the car doors after Peter leaves)\n(Peter picks the lock on a door and enters the makeshift lab. He finds a dozen or so people strapped to tables. Ming prepares a gagged woman for parasite removal and Peter attacks him, knocking him to the ground)\nPETER: (in Cantonese to the terrified woman) You're gonna be okay. I'll get you out of here. (Peter is subdued)\nWALTER: (locks the car doors after Peter leaves and sings softly to himself) ...goes to all the shows, steps right in to the lions' den and tell them all he knows, puts his head in the lions' den...\nMING CHE: (Peter is strapped to a table. nose is bloodied. Ming prepares a worm for Peter to ingest) Someone must know you're here. They coming soon?\nPETER: (turning from the worm inches from his mouth) Nobody else knows I'm here.\nMING CHE: Somehow I don't believe you.\nPETER: (smart-alecky) Oh, that's a shame. Most people find me very trustworthy. (Ming nods and Pan Che grabs Peter by the face to force open his mouth. outside, the assault team arrives and prepares to raid the shop)\nMING CHE: Open. Open. If you try to chew this, it will kill you. (places the worm in Peter's mouth. Pan holds Bishops mouth closed) Swallow!\nOLIVIA: (door to the room bursts open) F-B-I- !!\nAGENT: Keep your hands where I can see them.\nOLIVIA: Gun !! (as Ming draws a pistol. she shoots him twice in the chest)\nBROYLES: (to Pan Che) On your knees. Hands behind your head.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter, as he spits the worm out) Are you okay?\nPETER: (panting) Yeah. Yeah. I am now.\nWALTER: (entering from outside) Astrid. Astrid.\nASTRID: Walter. Thought I lost you. Don't worry about this place. Okay, I'm, uh, I'm gonna clean this up. (somberly)\nPETER: Peter said you were followed. (sees her injured face) Oh, dear God. I'm so sorry. I didn't know.\nASTRID: Walter, it's not your fault. (both deeply saddened, Walter gives her a big paternal hug)\nBROYLES: (walking the corridor) What's the status of the Chinese nationals?\nOLIVIA: Well, some are still in surgery. The rest in the ICU. Only time will tell. The doctor says it's a good prognosis for Mei Lin's daughter and husband. What's gonna happen to them?\nBROYLES: The State Department has agreed to grant them all political asylum.\nPETER: With all those people carrying Ming Che's medicine, he must've been treating other people like Matt Jarvis.\nBROYLES: We turned up more financial records at his shop that trace back to six other patients with immune deficiency. They're being questioned now.\nOLIVIA: Did we find anything else in his shop that could lead us to John Hsu?\nBROYLES: What we found is that there is no John Hsu. He's an alias -- used as a front for all of Ming Che's financial dealings. Good work, you two.\nOLIVIA: There's still something I need to take care of... 'scuse me. (she joins Mei Lin and her daughter in their room. Olivia returns the toy bird that the girl left on her freighter. everyone smiles)\nWALTER: (waking his son who is asleep on the couch) Peter.\nPETER: (grunts to life. groggy. turns on the light. stretches) What time is it, Walter?\nWALTER: (confessing) I want so badly to be independent again... to live like a man, not a child. Not to have my son watching after me all the time. Not that I don't appreciate all that you do for me. That's not the way it's supposed to be.\nPETER: Walter...\nWALTER: ...let me finish. I've been out of the institution for a year now. And I've just begun my journey back towards being whole. But I fear there are still times when I will get lost. So -- so I have implanted a tracking device in my neck. (points to the bandage below his left ear)\nPETER: You did what? (disappointed) Oh, Walter.\nWALTER: And here is the transponder so you can find me. I should let you get back to sleep. (leaves the room)\nPETER: Good night, Walter.\nWALTER: Good night, my son. (transponder beeps slowly)"

What kind of flowers?\nJOSEPH SLATER: Uh, I'm not sure.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Thank you, Mister Slater. It will come. (preparing medical tools)\nJOSEPH SLATER: Heather -- the flowers in her hair. The fl -- the flowers in her hair are heather.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Oh, I think so. Yes. (to his aide) Container. (to Slater as he takes foreceps to the back of his scalp) Now hold very still. I assure you there will be no pain. (pulls a bloody piece of tissue from the back of Slater's exposed brain. places the extracted tissue in a gelatinous suspension, then, to his aide) Let's close him up. (removes latex gloves)\nTHIN MAN: (to Newton) Hold on. (to his tactical radio) Yeah?\nSMITH: (outside the facility, in to his radio) We've got activity.\n(inside, Newton's aide removes his pistol as an orderly approaches Slater's room)\nORDERLY: Code Gray, Corridor \u2018B\u2019 (then grunts as he is shot twice in the chest)\nTHIN MAN: (returning to Newton and Slater) We have two minutes, maybe three.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (to the silent Slater) Oh, my sincere apologies. (abandoning his patient before he has completed the medical procedure) I'd rather not leave you in such a state.\n(the inside team scurries to the nearest exit, packing their medical equipment as they go. outside, they hop into the waiting van and Smith drives them away)\nNURSE HOLBROOK: (responding to the security call, she enters the patient's room) Mister S - Slater?\nJOSEPH SLATER: (turning to face her with a third of his skull removed and much of his brain exposed. quietly) ... help me.\nOLIVIA: (approaches the gate at the Mental Health Institute and stops to identify herself to security) Special Agent Olivia Dunham with the F.B.I. -- these two men are consultants -- Peter Bishop and Doctor Walter Bishop. We're here to investigate the break-in.\nSECURITY GUARD: (to the good doctor in the backseat) And you're Doctor Bishop?\nWALTER: Yes. And I'm perfectly sane.\nDOCTOR WEST: (walking the halls with the science team) Joseph Slater has been a patient here for the last fourteen years. When he was admitted, he was diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia.\nOLIVIA: His file said that he suffered from delusions, false memories, severe emotional swings.\nDOCTOR WEST: Every classical symptom of the condition -- he exhibited each one.\nOLIVIA: Until last night.\nDOCTOR WEST: That's right. And within an hour, after discovering what had been done to Mister Slater, the change in his behavior is nothing short of remarkable.\nPETER: So basically, two guys broke in, cut a big hole in his head and did what, drove him sane?\nDOCTOR WEST: As unlikely as it sounds, yes. And just as strange, we can't find evidence that they did anything to him. Mister Slater's brain is structurally intact. We ran blood tests, tox screens -- nothing came back unusual.\nOLIVIA: We'll need to see his medical reports. And also his personal history. Of course.\n(Walter is distracted by some commotion nearby - a pateint drops something \"aah!\" -- a caregiver responds \"Sir? Oh, boy. Everything's gonna be okay.\")\nWALTER: (anxiously) Doctor, I'd like to see the patient.\nPETER: That's where we're going right now, Walter, to see Mister Slater.\nWALTER: No, Peter, we're going to see a sane man. (to Doctor West) I'd like to see him when he was a patient.\nJOSEPH SLATER: (in the Doctor's office. on videotape) No, no, no, the girl in the red dress... chrysanthemums in her hair. Her mother grows them in a box on the window sill.\nDOCTOR WEST: (on tape with Slater) And where does this little girl live?\nJOSEPH SLATER: Across the street.\nDOCTOR WEST: No, Joseph, she doesn't.\nJOSEPH SLATER: She -- she moved.\nDOCTOR WEST: She was never there.\nJOSEPH SLATER: (psychotic outburst) What did you do with her? What did you do? What did you do with her? You give her back. Give her back! Bring her back! Bring her back! Bring her ba-- (end tape as Walter watches, visibly upset at the man's condition)\nOLIVIA: (later, as everyone talks to the healthy Slater in-person) ...and you can't describe either of the men?\nJOSEPH SLATER: No. To be honest, I can barely remember them. My first clear memory of last night, I was turning from my window, and Miss Holbrook was standing there -- one of the nurses, she was scared. And they raced me to the Medical Ward. But what struck me was that I felt unburdened, like my mind had had a spring cleaning, like I was suddenly...\nWALTER: ...free.\nJOSEPH SLATER: Yes. And I seem to remember them being... pleasant -- polite even -- but beyond that, nothing. I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: That's okay.\nDOCTOR WEST: (to Olivia) Anything else?\nOLIVIA: No. Not right now. Thank you.\nDOCTOR WEST: Okay, in that case, Mister Slater, your wife is here.\nJOSEPH SLATER: They tell me that she came to visit me twice a week. I think I remember being horrible to her.\nDOCTOR WEST: I think it'll be fine. She's right outside.\nJOSEPH SLATER: Thank you. (leaves the room)\nWALTER: He's a lucky man. Seventeen years that I was in St. Claire's, never a single visitor.\nPETER: Walter...\nWALTER: Oh, I wasn't trying to make you feel guilty, son. It was just an observation.\nOLIVIA: Walter, have you had any theories on how this man is suddenly sane?\nWALTER: No. Not yet, but I'm eager to. A remedy for insanity, as you can imagine, I have thought long and hard about it.\nOLIVIA: (standing in the security monitor room) There they are.\nPETER: Huh. You see that lock? Can you zoom in right there? (points to the monitor) That's a Lypticro-Crypto. It's top of the line. And these guys took it down like it's a bicycle lock. Whoever these guys are, they're either very smart, very rich, or very well-connected.\nOLIVIA: (to the security technician as the brain harvesters defeat the security system) Can you play that bit back?\nPETER: (to Olivia) What?\nOLIVIA: Freeze it right there, when he turns around. I know that face. (to the security technician) Can I use this? (asking him to step outside while she inspects further) And some privacy, if you don't mind. (she starts to type. Walter looks on... sampling a pudding cup he has obtained)\nPETER: (referring to the image of Thomas Newton on the screen) You know him?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nPETER: Where do you know him from?\nOLIVIA: From Laston-Hennings Cryonics.\nWALTER: Are you referring to the theft of the frozen heads?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. William Bell told me that the people from over there, the people that tried to kill me, that killed Charlie, they were looking for someone.\nWALTER: Belly said they were looking for their leader...(?)\nOLIVIA: Well, I've been combing through Laston-Hennings' files, trying to figure out, of all the heads they took, which was the one that they wanted? I've been looking at these faces For the last two months.\nPETER: Are you really trying to tell us that he is one of the heads that they stole? (she nods) Fine. Let's say for a second that you're right. Frozen heads don't just get up and walk into places. I mean, the dead don't rise out of their graves and perform midnight brain surgery.\nOLIVIA: No, I know they don't. But this one did. (reads the mnitor) Thomas Jerome Newton.\nWALTER: (somewhat amazed) Wow.\nBROYLES: Newton. So what do we know about him so far?\nOLIVIA: Besides his name, nothing. Thomas Jerome Newton was the name on record at Laston-Hennings Cryonics. But it was an alias. It led nowhere. Now, William Bell told me the man with that marking would try to open a corridor from our universe to the other side. I managed to infer that the results would be less than desirable.\nBROYLES: Exactly how much less desirable?\nOLIVIA: Global destruction... biblical proportions.\nBROYLES: So what's that have to do with sneaking into a mental hospital to perform brain surgery on a schizophrenic?\nPETER: You're leaving out the part where they apparently cured him. As opening moves go, that one's pretty strange.\nBROYLES: Where's Doctor Bishop on this?\nPETER: He's trying to figure out exactly how they cured Slater. If he can do that, maybe we can anticipate Newton's next move.\nOLIVIA: There's no maybe. I don't know what Newton's up to, but I know what I have to do. I have to stop him.\nWALTER: Mister Slater's referring doctor was a psychiatrist called Simon Paris. Let's see if you could locate Doctor Paris, please, dear. I have some questions about Mister Slater's medical history before his admission to Hennington.\nASTRID: Sure. Why, what are you looking for?\nWALTER: Not sure. Something that would induce the delusional thinking.\nASTRID: Some thing?\nWALTER: Something or someone.\nASTRID: (starts a computer search) You mean you think that someone made him crazy on purpose?\nWALTER: (casual) It's a theory. The truth is there is no cure for madness -- it's a fantasy. The road back from madness is a struggle. Only the luckiest of people find their way, more or less, back to the world you live in. And from what we saw of Mister Slater, well, my only supposition is that he wasn't mad to begin with.\nASTRID: There is no Simon Paris in the A.M.A. database. He's not on the membership roster. Does that mean that he died?\nWALTER: It shouldn't. Even if he had, there should still be a record. Um, Mister Paris' RX number will be on Mister Slater's initial prescription when he was admitted. Check the pharmacy records.\nASTRID: Why would someone do that, Walter -- make someone crazy?\nWALTER: Any number of reasons. It would make them insusceptible to interrogation.\nASTRID: Huh, according to this, fourteen years ago, Doctor Paris set up an indefinite prescription of medications for Mister Slater. No termination date. Now, this is interesting. (reads from monitor) In the same week, he wrote the same prescription for two other patients.\nWALTER: In the same week?\nASTRID: At two other hospitals. I'll call Olivia. (dials cell phone)\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: (walking with Peter and Olivia) ...and when I woke up, I felt like I had been out drinking the night before. Only the night lasted fourteen years.\nOLIVIA: (references a file) It says here that you suffered from a severe form of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: Yeah, \u2018Arithmomania\u2019 they call it.\nPETER: You're obsessed with numbers.\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: Just one, actually -- I'd see it everywhere, hear it everywhere. I could never get it out of my head. Twenty-eight, twenty-eight. Then, uh, last Tuesday morning, I woke up, and it was gone, just like that. Suddenly I was free.\nPETER: And your doctors have no explanation?\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: Between you and me, I think that's why they're keeping me here. One of them is probably hoping to get a paper out of it. So what does this have to do with the F.B.I. ?\nOLIVIA: we're not sure. Maybe nothing. But do you mind if we take a look at your head?\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: My head?\nOLIVIA: It should only take a minute. Is there somewhere that you could sit down?\nPETER: (examines the scalp of the seated woman) Excuse me.\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: What are you looking for?\nPETER: It's here. A fresh scar, but there are no sutures. Looks more like the burn from a surgical laser.\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: I don't understand. What kind of scar? What are you saying happened to me?\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Crampton, did you have any visitors during your stay here?\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: My husband, my son.\nOLIVIA: But what about the doctor who referred you -- Doctor Paris?\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: No. Never. I only saw him a couple times before he sent me here.\nPETER: But it was Doctor Paris who diagnosed the Arithmomania, right?\nDEBORAH CRAMPTON: Oh, no. He saw me for mild depression, postpartum. Told me I needed to rest a few weeks and sent me here. The Arithmomania just started one day.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: How we doing?\nSMITH: It should work, but we took too long getting to Slater. The first specimen's dying. The nutrient bath won't keep it alive for more than another five hours, six if we're lucky.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Then we better get moving. (connects another brain sample to a nutrient bath)\nPETER: (looking through a patient file) Third patient, Stuart Gordon. Just like Mrs. Crampton. Fourteen years ago, Doctor Paris refers him to a mental hospital with the psychiatric equivalent of a cough, which then develops into full-blown schizophrenia. Two days ago, he miraculously recovers. Apparently Mister Gordon thought he was the actor Sydney Greenstreet -- and walked around quotingCasablanca. That's funny.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: He looks a lot more like Peter Lorre. (holds out photo) That's a joke.\nOLIVIA: You know, all my life I've been able to understand what drives people -- their emotions, like greed or envy or revenge. But Newton -- these people we're up against... how can I fight what I can't understand?\nPETER: Olivia, I know you think you're alone in this. Maybe that's because of what Bell told you. Maybe that's just your personality. But this isn't just your fight.\nASTRID: (after hanging-up) That was Olivia. Stuart Gordon is just like the others. Two days ago, he woke up perfectly sane. He's got a fresh scar on the back of his head.\nWALTER: I must have missed something. (studies data) When did Mister Slater have an organ transplant?\nASTRID: I'm sorry?\nWALTER: Oh, one of the drugs that Doctor Paris prescribed is Sirolimus -- it's an anti-rejection drug. It's only given to organ-transplant patients. It's absolutely useless for a paranoid schizophrenic. It suggests that not only has Doctor Paris vanished, he's a quack! Unless he's a genius.\nASTRID: What?\nWALTER: (to Astrid) Organ transplants. (after Peter and Olivia return) The human brain. Well, half of one. (studies lab sample) But it's useless dead, because when you remove brain tissue from a living body, you can keep it alive for a short time in a nutrient suspension. But eventually it will die. It's a problem I've tried to solve many times without success.\nPETER: Keeping a human brain alive?\nWALTER: It's very tricky. You see, it's not enough to simply give it blood and oxygen. You have to give it electrical stimulation as well. But... Doctor Paris found a solution. He stored the brain tissue inside of another brain.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, I don't follow. What brain tissue?\nWALTER: Our mental patients'. Mister Slater, Mrs. Crampton, and Mister Condon.\nASTRID: Gordon.\nWALTER: These are a few years old. (refers to imaging) But you see the slight discoloration here?\nPETER: mm-hmm.\nWALTER: Normally that would be interpreted as machine error. But this is not a machine error. This is foreign tissue.\nASTRID: That's why they were all on anti-rejection drugs.\nOLIVIA: So the surgeries that Newton performed...\nPETER: He was removing transplanted brain tissue.\nWALTER: And my hypothesis explains the patients' madness. Putting the tissue of one person into the brain of another is -- It's like putting a motorcycle engine into a car. It's simply incompatible.\nPETER: Of course, because the host mind would have no way to process the new information. Thus, the mental distress. The false memories, delusions. But as soon as you remove the foreign tissue, then they're fine.\nWALTER: Correct.\nASTRID: (answers ringing cell phone) Agent Farnsworth.\nDOCTOR WEST: (on her phone) Hi, this is Doctor West. You asked me to see if we had any information on Doctor Paris at our facility -- we didn't.\nASTRID: Oh, alright. Well, thank you for...\nDOCTOR WEST: ...I'm not finished. We also checked with some of our affiliated facilities.\nASTRID: Oh?\nOLIVIA: (to Walter) Well, that just leaves more questions. Why cut out someone's brain and store it inside other people? And whose brain is it?\nWALTER: That's a good question, of course. And I have no idea.\nASTRID: (summons Peter for a quiet chat after the phone call) Peter, can I, uh, speak to you a moment? (both look at Walter after Astrid shares her news)\nPETER: Walter, you said that you never had any visitors in your time at St. Claire's, right?\nWALTER: That's right.\nPETER: According to their records, Doctor Paris visited you on six separate occasions. (everyone appears concerned) You mind if I take a look at your head?\nWALTER: Okay.\nPETER: (moves the hair around to search his father's scalp) It's there. It - it's different. It's older. But... (sighs) there's definitely a scar.\nDOCTOR WEST: From your chart, it appears that you've been through this procedure before, several times, in fact.\nWALTER: This is not a good idea, Peter. These M.R.I. machines have magnets that rip the metal out of the patients. And I have that tracking chip implanted in my neck -- the GPS locator. I...\nPETER: ... you have absolutely nothing to worry about, because it's made out of silicon. And you know as well as I do that it won't be affected by the machine. Maybe some Valium would help.\nWALTER: You know, I don't do Valium nearly enough. That's a good idea. I'll have 50 milligrams, please.\nDOCTOR WEST: Well, that's -- that's quite a high dosage.\nWALTER: I have quite a high tolerance.\nDOCTOR WEST: Alright.\nPETER: You're going to be fine.\nWALTER: Yeah.\nPETER: It's a routine procedure. And the Valium will take care of any claustrophobia you might be feeling.\nWALTER: I'm not worried about claustrophobia, Peter. What do you think that man did to me?\nPETER: I don't know, Walter. But we're going to find out, okay? (watches from the observation room as the procedure begins)\nOLIVIA: (joins Peter later as he sits alone next to the MRI machine) You okay?\nPETER: Yeah. Walter wanted to stick around and wait for the results, but there's Walter on drugs, and then there's Walter on drugs. I had Astrid take him home. You see the look on his face when we were talking to Mister Slater? What do you think that's like for him... wishing that he could turn back the clock to before he went crazy? He's just sane enough to realize how much he's lost.\nOLIVIA: I don't mean to sound callous, but... from what I know of your father, going crazy made him a better person. It certainly made him a better father.\nPETER: I should have visited him in St. Claire's.\nOLIVIA: I think you're making up for that now.\nDOCTOR WEST: (joins the two in the room) I've reviewed the scans of your father's brain.\nPETER: And?\nDOCTOR WEST: You should take a look. (as they stand in front of the MRI images) I - I've never seen anything like it. Three scars, all on the same side in the left temporal lobe.\nPETER: These incisions go all the way down into the gray matter.\nDOCTOR WEST: I'm not following.\nPETER: Walter didn't have brain tissue implanted. He had it removed.\nDOCTOR WEST: Yes, from the hippocampus. And as far as I can tell, there would be no medical reason for it.\nOLIVIA: So what does it do... the hippocampus?\nDOCTOR WEST: It controls our inhibitions, Helps store long-term memory, contributes to our sense of spatial awareness.\nPETER: Doctor, do you have the scans of the other three patients?\nDOCTOR WEST: Sure.\nOLIVIA: What are you thinking?\nPETER: Hold on one second. (starts overlaying images) This is the piece they put in Slater. Look... it's a perfect fit. (points to alignment between patients and parts)\nWALTER: I took too much Valium. Confusion, dizziness, nausea. I think I must have miscalculated the dose.\nASTRID: Maybe we should take you to a hospital, Walter.\nWALTER: I don't want to go to a hospital. I need Violet Sedan Chair.\nASTRID: Walter, you're not making any sense.\nWALTER: My dear, Violet Sedan Chair... it's a band. Their debut album... always helps me come down from a Valium high. It's in the lab. We should go -- (straining)\nASTRID: Walter...\nWALTER: No, you -- you do the driving. I might puke in your car.\nASTRID: Why don't you stay here and rest and let me get it?\nWALTER: (sitting down) That might be the best.\nASTRID: I'll be back. (leaving the home)\nOLIVIA: It must be Paris. He must have removed pieces of Walter's brain. But why? And -- and why preserve them?\nPETER: Memory. The hippocampus -- memory storage. Bell told you that Newton wants to open a door to the other side, right? Well, we already know that Walter's done that. He just can't remember how. That is why he can't remember. He literally had the memories removed.\nOLIVIA: No way. So then how does Newton read them?\nPETER: In theory, he shouldn't be able to. But in theory, he should still be a frozen head. So in the Department of How to Make Impossible Things Possible, what would he need to do? He would need to... implant the memories into a brain that could interpret them.\nOLIVIA: Walter. (start to depart the hospital)\nASTRID: (answers cell phone while driving) Hello?\nPETER: Astrid, where are you and Walter?\nASTRID: I'm going to the lab. He's at your house. He sent me to get him an album. How long ago?\nASTRID: Five minutes ago.\nPETER: You've got to get back there. Walter is in danger.\nASTRID: I'm on my way. (makes an aggressive u-turn with the car)\nWALTER: (gets up to answer the loud knocking on his door) Calm down, Agent Farnsworth. You don't have to wake the whole neighborhood. (opens door)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (smugly) Hello, Doctor Bishop.\nASTRID: Peter. He was already gone when I got here. I'm sorry. Peter, I - I shouldn't have left him.\nPETER: It's not your fault. You didn't know. I've got an idea. Last week when Walter got lost, he did exactly what you'd expect Walter to do. He implanted a transponder chip into his neck so that if he ever got lost, I could find him. He can't be far. Let's go.\nSMITH: Hold still, please. This wont hurt a bit.\nWALTER: I'm sorry, do we know each other?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Oh, we will.\nTHIN MAN: This is a mild sedative, something to calm your nerves.\nWALTER: I've already had fifty milligrams of Valium.\nTHIN MAN: Then this should be very enjoyable. (injects Walter)\n(Olivia drives as Peter uses the tracking device)\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: Dunham, what's your '20'?\nOLIVIA: We're two blocks South of the Boylston \"T\" stop.\nBROYLES: Boston PD is sending an Entry and Apprehension Unit. I'm sending them to your location.\nPETER: (to Olivia) Keep going. Keep going, and take the next left you see.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (continuing to probe Walter in the makeshift lab) The human brain is a fascinating organ. But it's not static. Removal will damage a section. It reroutes the connections and grows in new pathways. Now, figuring out where the old connections once were can be very tricky. (activates neural scanner)\nPETER: (in car with Olivia. racing to find Walter) Take the next left. (screeching to a stop with the apprehension team close behind, the group races down stairs on a busy public street to a restroom. the tracker beeps faster) Here. He's down here!\nE&A TEAM: Go, go, go! Move, move! Whoa!\nE&A MAN: Checking right.\nPETER: Walter!\nE&A MAN: Clear! (checking the area)\nOLIVIA: (as Peter finds the bloody micro-transponder in a sink) They found the chip.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I'm going to show you a series of photos. When you see an image, I want you to tell me the first thing that comes to mind. There are no right or wrong answers. But please tell me the truth. If you don't, I'll know.\nWALTER: You're using associations to map my brain function, locate my neural pathways. Are you trying to fix me?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I'm afraid not. Tell me what you think when you see this. (shows the first image)\nWALTER: My first semester of Organic Chem. My lab partner and I used to sit up in the back, sniffing benzine fumes. (laughs weakly)\nWALTER: Hmm. Peter. (delighted at image of young boy playing) Peter. (delighted again) Peter. (sad at image of a small coffin)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I'm sorry. I know this is difficult.\nSMITH: It's not working. He's not making the connections. Should I recalibrate the machine?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: No, no, no, no, no. We need to find something more powerful to stimulate his memory. Of course. Human memory is sensory based. Vision alone is not the strongest trigger. Sound and smell actually work better. We need... a proper context.\nOLIVIA: (getting a plan together) Okay, Walter said brain tissue can't survive for long outside a human body.\nBROYLES: Which means they've got to be close. We've raised the alert level at every hospital, emergency care facility, and outpatient clinic in the Greater Boston Area. We're even calling veterinarians.\nOLIVIA: That's assuming that they need a hospital to complete the procedure. With their level of technology, we can't know for sure.\nBROYLES: It's a start, and if we're wrong, we'll have to get creative.\nPETER: (thinking hard) The girl in the red dress. How did I miss this? The girl in the red dress, 28, 28, Sydney Greenstreet. Doctor Paris' patients, they all had obsessions. Slater was always ranting about the girl who lived across the street, the one that we thought never existed. She did exist. She lived across the street from me when I lived in Cambridge as a kid. Her name was Sydney. She lived at 2828 Green Street.\nOLIVIA: So those were Walter's memories.\nPETER: Exactly. Memory is all about -- it's all about context, all about association. Every time Walter asks for a piece of food or music or art, he's trying to recreate a moment in time to help him remember.\nBROYLES: Which suggests what?\nPETER: I don't know. I don't know. But if they're trying to get him to remember how it was that he built a door to the other side, maybe they're -- maybe they're gonna take him to the place that he did it.\nOLIVIA: Reiden Lake -- the lake house?\nPETER: No, no, no. That's where he actually opened the door, but it's not where he had the thought.\nWALTER: This place looks familiar. Last time I was here, it was a different season. The leaves were falling.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Yes, this place exists in both worlds. You see, but on my side, the trees died long ago. And the same thing killed the grass. They call it The Blight.\nWALTER: That's terrible.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Yes it is, isn't it?\nTHIN MAN: Smith is on lookout, and I've taken care of everything else. You're secured.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Good. Now, Doctor Bishop, I can see which areas of your brain can make sense of the data that's stored in these slivers of flesh. In a perfect world, I would simply put it back, but I would never subject you to a process so crude. But this is the only way we can reconnect these pieces of your brain. (electricity buzzing)\nWALTER: ah -- ah... (to electrical stimulus)\nTHIN MAN: The connection is complete.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Now, Doctor Bishop... you do know where you are, don't you?\nWALTER: Of course I do. (with clarity) This is my home. (proudly)\nTHIN MAN: It's working.\nWALTER: Where's my wife? (demanding) Where's my son? (chuckles) You drugged me.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Yes. And now... I have a question for you. You once built a door -- a door that let you walk between worlds. Tell me how you did it.\nWALTER: How are things on your side?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Worse, I'm told. I know why you built it, the door. I know what you lost. Now, are you going to pretend that you're willing to lose him again? Now, tell me about the door.\nSMITH: (from his surveillance vehicle near the house. as Peter and Olivia race by) We've got company.\nTHIN MAN: They're here.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: That's okay. We're done. We've got what we need. (removes the apparatus from Walter's head and packs his equipment) My apologies, Doctor Bishop. (as he injects Walter's arm with poison)\nPETER: (running with Olivia close behind, he smashes through the front door) Walter! Walter! (finds his father on the floor) Walter. Can you hear me? Walter! (slaps his face) Walter, can you hear me? (loudly) Walter!\nWALTER: (opens eyes, groggy) Hello, son. Would you help me?\nPETER: Sure. (sits Walter up and holds him in his arms)\nOLIVIA: (finds the residents of the house tied-up in the back room) It's okay. (pulls tape off the mouth of the man) I'm, uh-- I'm with the F.B.I. .\nMISTER RABEL: They just left. Out the back!\nOLIVIA: (runs out, down the back steps, and into the alley as Newton and his team get into their van and speed-off) Freeze! F.B.I.! (running after the van, she fires once as the van turns and hits the driver in the head. the van hits another vehicle and comes to a stop. Smith charges out the back door with pistols drawn and Olivia shoots him once in the forehead. she approaches the remaining occupant) Come out of there. Okay, step down slowly. (to Newton as he steps out of the vehicle) Keep your hands where I can see them. You so much as twitch, and you won't have a head left to refreeze. (slams him face down on a car hood)\nWALTER: (still struggling inside his old house. looking at the brain specimens in-solution) Are they mine?\nPETER: Yep.\nWALTER: My brain tissue, Peter... it's dying. Whatever was in there... memories I'll never get back.\nPETER: It's alright. You don't need them.\nWALTER: (chuckles) Hello, son. (struggles) Hello, son. (gags and collapses)\nPETER: Walter? Oh! Walter! Hey, Walter, look at me. Walter!\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (curbside with Olivia) I think there's something you should know. It's about Walter Bishop. He's going to die unless you do exactly what I say. I injected him with a neurotoxin, and unless he gets the antidote in four minutes, it will kill him. Call it my fail-safe to ensure my escape.\nOLIVIA: You're bluffing. (answers her cell phone) Hey, it's me.\nPETER: (calling from the house, panicky) They've done something to Walter. I - I don't know what it is, but I think maybe he's been poisoned. His pulse is racing.\nOLIVIA: (to Newton, pistol leveled at him) What did you do to him?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Ask him if he sees a medical kit I left behind.\nPETER: Olivia, you've got to get back here. Please! Please. I need your help.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Peter, listen to me. Do you see a medical kit?\nPETER: Yeah, there's one here on the table. Why?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: There are three vials in the kit. Injected in the correct order, they neutralize the toxin.\nOLIVIA: (aims pistol) Tell me.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: No, no, no, no, no. Not yet. (looks at watch) You have about two minutes until Doctor Bishop dies. at a flat run, I estimate about forty seconds until you get back to him. Now, hand me your phone. When I hear you go back into the house, from Peter's phone, I'll tell you what to do.\nOLIVIA: You're crazy if you think I'm letting you go.\nPETER: Olivia, please, I need your help. I think he's dying. Oh God, Walter. Walter!\nTHOMAS NEWTON: The choice is yours. You can have me... or Walter Bishop.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: One minute, forty-five seconds. Come on Olivia.\nPETER: (on phone) Olivia, please, you\u2019ve got to get back here. I need your help.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Make your choice -- me or Walter Bishop.\nOLIVIA: Go to hell. (throws him her phone, runs back inside to Peter. to Peter) Give me your phone! (on Phone to Newton) Okay, you son of a bitch.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Do you have the medical kit?\nOLIVIA: Got it. Okay, tell me how to do this.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Blue... Yellow... Red.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Blue, yellow, red. (injects Walter)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: And, Olivia, now I know how weak you are. (runs away, hangs-up)\nWALTER: (gasps awake) Peter... I have a terrible headache... and a sudden craving for chicken wings.\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) He was right. I made an emotional choice. I chose my friend over my responsibility. And we have no idea if Walter gave Newton the plans for the door. Walter doesn't remember, and the brain tissue that Newton extracted is dead.\nBROYLES: And Doctor Paris?\nOLIVIA: Nothing. He's vanished. So all we have is more questions. I mean, who is Paris? How did Newton know about Walter's memories? And why did they let Walter live?\nBROYLES: I suspect that's the way this is going to be. The more answers we get, the more questions they'll lead to.\nOLIVIA: We didn't get any answers.\nBROYLES: Sure we did. We've given our enemy a name and a face. That's something. And you saved Doctor Bishop's life. That's something too, because despite what you think, you made a rational choice, not an emotional one. If you had captured Newton, or even killed him, that wouldn't have been the end of this. But there's only one Walter Bishop... and we'll be needing him before this is over. Don't be so hard on yourself. We're gonna be needing you too.\nPETER: (as Walter settles into the machine for additional diagnosis) They just want to make sure that everything's okay.\nWALTER: I know.\nPETER: I should have visited you, Walter, While you were in St. Claire's.\nWALTER: Oh, that's okay, Peter. If you had, I probably wouldn't have remembered anyway.\nPETER: I'll be right outside if you need me. (leaves the imaging room. door close behind him)\n(Walter relaxes and closes his eyes. a flood of memories return to him. he is being prepped for a cranial procedure. Doctor Paris consults with the physician preparing Walter for the surgery.\nO.R. DOCTOR: He's ready, Doctor Paris.\nWILLIAM BELL: His system is completely clean? No sedatives, no antidepressants?\nO.R. DOCTOR: The electrodes are in place.\nWILLIAM BELL: Good. Hello, Walter. Are you comfortable?\nWALTER: Comfortable? I'm frightened, Belly.\nWILLIAM BELL: I wish there was another way, but what you've accomplished... it's just too dangerous.\nWALTER: But what if we ever have to go back?\nWILLIAM BELL: Don't worry. Your memory -- I'll put it in a place that only I can find. Now, listen to me, Walter. You designed a door to the other side. I want you to think about that door."

May the Lord, who frees you from sin save you and, in his goodness, raise you up.\nDOCTOR NEWELL: (to Maureen Donovan) Are you ready? (the somber mom nods yes. and the technician deactivates the electrical life support device. the breathing apparatus stops and the teenage patients vital signs flatline. the attending doctor checks her watch and declares to all) Time of death, 5:21 A.M. (to Maureen Donovan) We have a team assembled and waiting. Ms. Donovan, I'm afraid we need to begin the procedures right away.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: (tearful) I love you. (kisses her daughters cheek)\n(quickly ushering the gurney with the dead teenager through the halls of the hospital)\nMALE TECH: We've gotta hurry up. Core temp's dropped.\nFEMALE TECH: Where's the list?\nMALE TECH: Yep.\nFEMALE TECH: Watch your back, sir. Get her to Harvest.\n(in the post-mortem operating room, preparing to harvest viable organs from the dead teenager)\nFEMALE TECH: We'll be able to coordinate that with the transplant team.\nNURSE: Great. Do we have a time frame?\nFEMALE TECH: Not yet.\nNURSE: Lean it over.\nDOCTOR HALPERIN: (after having cut into the lower anterior of the thoracic cavity) I am going to begin with the kidneys. The heart and lung block are going to come last... - - Clamping off the Renal Artery... now.\nNURSE: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR HALPERIN: Alright, I've got the first one.\nNURSE: (as the dead young woman bolts up, and awake) Oh God! She's alive!\nDOCTOR HALPERIN: Get a trauma team in here!\nLISA DONOVAN: (shouting repeatedly) 6-8-3-3-9-alpha-echo-3-5-8!... ...6-8-3-3-9-alpha-echo-3-5-8!...\n(walking in and getting a briefing from the boss)\nBROYLES: The girl's name is Lisa Donovan. She's a high school Junior. She collapsed during gym class last week and slipped into a coma. Doctors diagnosed a cerebral aneurysm. After she was determined brain-dead, her mother made the decision to take her off life support.\nOLIVIA: And then she woke up from the dead - - screaming random numbers.\nBROYLES: This is Lieutenant Commander Turlough, United States Navy. He's here because it turns out those numbers weren't random. They're an alphanumeric code. The lead surgeon did two tours on an aircraft carrier. He recognized one section as lineal identification for sailors in the U.S. Navy.\nWILL TURLOUGH: That's when I got the call. {displays file and photo) The first half of the sequence is I.D. Information for a Petty Officer named Andrew Rusk. The second half of the sequence are launch codes for ICBM missiles aboard a nuclear submarine. He was stationed on the U.S.S. Gloucester.\nOLIVIA: How did classified launch codes get into the hands of a seventeen year-old girl?\nWILL TURLOUGH: Exactly. That's what I want to ask Rusk. If he's revealing these codes, he's committing high treason. When I tried contacting him, his wife told me she reported him missing.\nBROYLES: That was three days ago.\nPETER: Just to ask the obvious, you've considered the possibility there's some sort of connection between Rusk and the girl?\nWILL TURLOUGH: None that we're aware of. As far as we can tell, there's never been any contact between Lisa Donovan and Andrew Rusk.\nWALTER: Well, I suppose that's where we come in.\nOLIVIA: So how is she?\nBROYLES: Scared, as you can imagine.\n(in the teenager's hospital room)\nLISA DONOVAN: I'm sorry. I've never seen him before.\nOLIVIA: The numbers that you repeated, do you know what they are, or do you remember hearing them before?\nLISA DONOVAN: I don't even remember saying them. I'm sorry.\nPETER: Well, at least they got you some nice balloons.\nLISA DONOVAN: I guess they couldn't find ones that said, \"Welcome Back From The Dead.\"\nPETER: (laughs) Yeah. I imagine those would be more of a special-order kind of thing, don't you think?\nOLIVIA: Lisa, I just have a couple more questions. The man's name is Andrew Rusk. Does that ring any bells?\nLISA DONOVAN: Maya Zvezdochka. Shto Samnoy?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Lisa?\nLISA DONOVAN: Pochimu ya ne magu govorit?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: What's happening?\nPETER: She's speaking Russian.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: But she doesn't speak Russian.\nLISA DONOVAN: Maya Zvezdochka.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Lisa? Are you okay?\nLISA DONOVAN: Mom. What's happening to me?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I don't know. But you're fine now. No more questions, please. She should rest.\nOLIVIA: Of course.\n(walking the corridors)\nWILL TURLOUGH: Rusk is fluent in Russian. He would have learned it during his training.\nPETER: Any idea what Little Star is?\nWILL TURLOUGH: Um...\nPETER: Maya Zvezdochka means Little Star in Russian. I dated a Russian girl for a while. Most of what I picked up was curse words, but...\nOLIVIA: Hey. Where's Walter?\n(after finding his father in the Extended Care Ward)\nPETER: Walter!\nWALTER: Shh. I'm trying to listen.\nPETER: Listening to what? These people are in comas. They can't talk to you.\nWALTER: (to a comatose senior female) Don't judge him. He's my son. And despite his narrow-mindedness, I'm quite proud.\nPETER: Do you honestly think you're communicating with her?\nWALTER: Why shouldn't I be? No one truly understands the nature of human consciousness, Peter. I've read documented cases of coma patients waking up and claiming that they had moved, spirit-like, to remote locations and witnessed events they couldn't possibly have knowledge of. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that's what's happened to the young lady we just saw.\nPETER: Yeah, so... you're saying that you think, while Lisa Donovan died for a moment, her -- what, her spirit somehow left her body and floated over Andrew Rusk while he was in the process of telling somebody else those secret launch codes.\nWALTER: Well, \"floated over\" is a tad specific, but... something like that, yes. It's a theory.\nPETER: It certainly is.\n(outside of Lisa's room)\nOLIVIA: Hi.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Agent Dunham, I apologize if I was rude earlier.\nOLIVIA: How is she?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: They don't have any answers, and now she's running a fever. They want to run more tests. (rueful) We got into a fight the morning she collapsed. I wouldn't let her take the car. All she has is a learner's permit. And then I got the call from school. But by the time I got to the hospital, she was in a coma. You know, I never thought that I would... get a chance to tell her how much I loved her again. -- God gave her back to me.\nOLIVIA: You -- your daughter's been through a lot. And... so have you. I want permission to have Doctor Bishop examine her.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: What for?\nOLIVIA: I think he can help her. I think it might help find Andrew Rusk.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: There's nothing more that she can tell you.\n(in her room, Lisa finds her way to the sink, runs some water and rinses her face, hears a man's voice, then sees Rusk in the mirror when she looks up. she screams)\nMALE VOICE: (hauntingly soft) Maya Zvezdochka.\nLISA DONOVAN: (as her mother and Olivia find her) He was here. That man. He was here.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: (trying to comfort) Shh. Shh.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: (frightened) Andrew Rusk, the man in the picture. He was here. I saw him.\n(walking through the situation room)\nOLIVIA: We've searched the hospitals for Rusk and got nothing. And Maureen Donovan won't let us near her daughter. She said that our disruptive presence is what caused Lisa to hallucinate, seeing Rusk's image in the mirror.\nCHARLIE: How'd she explain her kid speaking Russian? Or knowing ICBM launch codes?\nTERESA RUSK: (intercepting the agents) Oh, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nTERESA RUSK: I was asked to come in. I'm Teresa Rusk.\n(in a private interview room with the agents, she is shown a photo)\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Rusk, do you know this girl?\nTERESA RUSK: I don't think so. No. Why, who is she?\nOLIVIA: Her name's Lisa Donovan. She's from Brighton.\nTERESA RUSK: You think she had something to do with my husband's disappearance?\nOLIVIA: We're not sure. But she has some information that only your husband should know.\nTERESA RUSK: Information?\nCHARLIE: Classified military codes.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Mrs. Rusk...\nTERESA RUSK: ...Teresa.\nOLIVIA: Teresa, do the words Maya Zvezda mean anything to you?\nTERESA RUSK: Where did you hear that?\nOLIVIA: From Lisa Donovan. Do you know what it means?\nTERESA RUSK: \"My Star\" - It's a pet name Andy calls me. I don't understand. Who is this girl? How could she know that? How?\nWALTER: Lisa Donovan's aneurysm occurred in her left frontal lobe. Specifically her Broca's Area.\nASTRID: That's the part of the brain that processes language.\nWALTER: Precisely. But it also has the capacity for something far more intriguing.\n(watching an old reel-to-reel film from a small projector)\nWALTER: (announcing on the old film) Hello, I'm Doctor Walter Bishop. This is Test Subject Number Six.\nPETER: (to his father) What happened to Subjects One through Five?\nWALTER: (to his son) I believe the university settled with them out of court. They probably never had to work again. Not that they could. (continues to explain to all, as the film runs) I was asked to design an experiment to test whether cranial manipulation could increase a person's psychic capability. I applied electrical stimuli to various parts of the brain and measured each psychic response. The point is that my tests proved that manipulation of Broca's Area had the most dramatic effect on a person's ability to create psychic bonds.\nPETER: So you think Lisa Donovan's aneurysm made her psychic.\nWALTER: It's certainly a possibility.\nPETER: Alright, well, let's say that you're correct. Why would she be channeling Rusk? What's so special about him?\nWALTER: That's a good question.\nOLIVIA: Walter, can you prove any of what you're saying? About her being psychic?\nWALTER: Perhaps, if I could examine the girl, but you say her mother has refused that.\nASTRID: (curtly) After watching Walter's scariest home videos, who can blame her?\n(Olivia approaches as services let out, and Maureen helps her still sore daughter down the steps)\nOLIVIA: Hi. How are you feeling?\nLISA DONOVAN: I've been really tired, but good, I guess.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: What are you doing here Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: We think we might have found an explanation for what happened to Lisa in the hospital.\nLISA DONOVAN: Really?\nOLIVIA: We believe that Andrew Rusk may be trying to communicate through you, psychically. We're not sure how or why, but it seems that there's a connection that's been developed between him and your daughter.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Lisa, give Agent Dunham and me a minute alone, please.\nPRIEST: Lisa, I want to introduce you to somebody. (escorts her away)\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Are you a religious woman, Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: No. I'm not.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Then I imagine you sit in judgment of those of us who rely on our faith to guide our decisions about what's best for our loved ones.\nOLIVIA: No. I know what faith can mean to a person. But, I also believe that what's happening to Lisa is real, and if Rusk is a national security risk...\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: ...whatever happened, Agent Dunham, it's over now. And I believe what's best for Lisa is that she put all of this behind her.\nOLIVIA: Here's my card. (hands her a business card) If anything else comes up.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Yeah. (huffing. she walks Lisa away from Olivia. Lisa turns and studies Olivia briefly. the priest nods)\n(sitting a side office with file cabinets. she does paperwork. he ponders)\nOLIVIA: The Tibetan Book of the Dead?\nPETER: Yeah, Walter's been reading up on psychic connections. In the Tibetan teachings, the near-death experiencer can often converse with those who have already died.\nOLIVIA: What do you think?\nPETER: Well... I think it makes a hell of a coaster. (puts his beer bottle on the large leather-bound book) What do I think about what happened to Lisa? I don't think she's alive because god changed his mind.\nOLIVIA: (playful) I'm just waiting to see if lightning strikes you.\nPETER: (chuckles) Yeah. I -- yeah. I mean, who am I to say? Maybe there is actually something to it. People are free to believe whatever they want, right? Lisa's mother certainly does. However, until I see it with my own eyes, I'm gonna put my money on healthy skepticism. (takes a slow sip of beer) You're obviously a believer.\nOLIVIA: My mother believed in God, but all the praying in the world didn't stop my stepfather from terrorizing her. And her faith just seemed to put her in harm's way. I'm worried that Lisa's mother is going to do the same thing. (answers cell phone, stands and walks) Dunham. Hello?\nLISA DONOVAN: Agent Dunham? It's Lisa Donovan.\nOLIVIA: Lisa. Are you okay?\nLISA DONOVAN: It hasn't stopped. I'm seeing him again, Andrew Rusk.\nOLIVIA: Where's your mother?\nLISA DONOVAN: She's at home, but I'm not. I had to come here. I keep seeing this place.\nOLIVIA: Okay, where are you?\n(in a poorly lit salvage yard with rows of expired vehicles stacked three-high in places, the duo enters)\nOLIVIA: Lisa?\nPETER: Lisa, where are you? (searching separately with flashlights, he spots Lisa next to vehicle and hails) Olivia. (to Lisa) Hey, you alright?\nLISA DONOVAN: He -- he was here.\nPETER: Who was here?\nLISA DONOVAN: I can see him.\nPETER: Andrew Rusk?\nLISA DONOVAN: There's someone else. Another man. He has a gun.\nOLIVIA: (as the teen collapses) Lisa?\nLISA DONOVAN: He shot him. He killed him. He killed Andrew Rusk.\nOLIVIA: Lisa, do you know the other man? Did you -- did you see his face?\nLISA DONOVAN: No.\nOLIVIA: (calmly) But you're sure that-- that they were here.\nLISA DONOVAN: Yes.\nPETER: (inspecting nearby) Olivia. Found a 9 millimeter shell casing.\n(later, after law enforcement vehicles have arrived at the yard)\nPETER: (wraps Lisa with a blanket) Here you go. Not the most stylish, I know, but it will keep you warm.\nOLIVIA: So I just talked to your mother, and she is on her way here.\nLISA DONOVAN: Is she mad?\nOLIVIA: No. She's just glad that you're okay.\nCHARLIE: (summons Olivia away from the teen) Hey, Liv.\nLISA DONOVAN: What is it?\nPETER: (corrals the teen) Why don't we just stay here for a second? Come get in the car. You can get warm.\nLAW OFFICER: It's Andrew Rusk.\nCHARLIE: (to Olivia) Your girl was right.\nPETER: (Lisa screams loudly and begins to severely convulse) Olivia, I need some help!\nOLIVIA: (returning) What happened?\nPETER: I don't know. She just started to seize.\nOLIVIA: I just talked to the Medical Examiner. He confirmed that Rusk was killed by a bullet wound to the head. Ruled out suicide.\nPETER: So everything Lisa told us pans out.\nOLIVIA: Except one thing. According to the rigor of the body, Rusk has been dead for three days.\nPETER: Well, then, how would he have been communicating with Lisa Donovan?\nWALTER: Was the Medical Examiner more specific? About the time of death, I mean.\nOLIVIA: Between 5:00 and 7:00 A.M. Why?\nWALTER: Interesting.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: How is she?\nDOCTOR NEWELL: Your daughter suffered a fairly substantial seizure.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Oh, my god.\nDOCTOR NEWELL: But she's responsive now, And her condition is stable. She's lucky. I don't think there's gonna be any permanent damage.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Is this because of her aneurysm?\nDOCTOR NEWELL: No, there's no connection between the two.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I don't understand. You said she was fine, but she keeps getting sicker. What's causing this?\nDOCTOR NEWELL: We'll run some tests, but, with seizures, the cause is often unknowable.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: You mean... This could happen again?\nDOCTOR NEWELL: We just don't know. But you should be able to see Lisa soon.\nWALTER: Excuse me. What time did your daughter's resurrection take place?\nPRIEST: Her resurrection?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Just after 5:00 in the morning.\nWALTER: Exactly as I suspected.\nOLIVIA: Walter. What are you thinking?\nWALTER: I propose that Rusk's murder and Lisa's rebirth happened simultaneously. In fact, it was his suddenly dispatched energy which jumpstarted the girl's body and brought her back to life.\nPRIEST: That's absurd.\nWALTER: Perhaps it is. Mm. Please allow me a moment to entertain my fantasies. They often lead to a truth. It's possible that Rusk's energy brought some of his memories with it. And it is these memories trapped within her, fighting to get out.\nPRIEST: Are you suggesting that Lisa is... Possessed?\nWALTER: I wasn't. But now that you mention it, I wouldn't be surprised if numerous possessions were in fact misdiagnosed cases of a phenomenon we are just now discovering.\nPRIEST: I hardly think that's what's happened here.\nWALTER: Oh, you hardly would because the church doesn't approve of exorcism anymore.\nPETER: Walter.\nPRIEST: (defensive) No, because they are merely superstition --\nWALTER: (angered) Because there are examples of casting out spirits right through the Bible, Father.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Can you help her?\nPRIEST: Maureen, what are you doing?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I have been praying, hoping that Lisa will get better. But she's not. If what you're saying is true, and this man's memories are making Lisa sick, can you -- can you get these memories out? Can you help my daughter?\nWALTER: I will need to have your daughter transferred to my lab.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Okay.\nPETER: Are you sure an exorcism is gonna work, Walter?\nWALTER: No, not at all. Unfortunately, I think I'm wrong. I can't explain the seizures. I believe that Rusk's energy would reanimate the girl and carry his memories, but... It doesn't suggest why she's sick. I was just so angry the way that man challenged me.\nOLIVIA: Walter, her mother is about to check her out of the hospital.\nWALTER: I have no idea what I'm going to do with her.\nPETER: We got to go in there and tell her. Olivia. What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: If Rusk is sick, could that make Lisa sick too?\nPETER: What, like... his illnesses would be transferred along with his spirit? You want to know what I think, or what Walter would think?\nOLIVIA: Either.\nPETER: Well, you read Rusk's file. Is there anything in there to suggest that he was sick?\nOLIVIA: No. But that was the Navy's official medical records.\nPETER: Well, you know me. If you tell me the U.S. Government is covering something up, I'll tell you it must be Tuesday.\nOLIVIA: Commander Turlough, thank you for coming back to talk to me.\nWILL TURLOUGH: Not a problem. Um, I was already here when Agent Broyles told me you found Andy Rusk's body.\nOLIVIA: Listen, why didn't you tell me he was sick?\nWILL TURLOUGH: I -- I'm sorry. Who told you that?\nOLIVIA: You did. Just then. What was wrong with him? Was it something that happened onboard the Gloucester? A young girl's life is on the line.\nWILL TURLOUGH: They were shadowing a Russian naval exercise in North Korean waters six months ago when a coolant line broke, causing a reactor leak. Rusk was locked in the engineering section for sixteen hours before they were able to vent the contamination.\nOLIVIA: Radiation. How could he possibly have survived?\nWILL TURLOUGH: He was airlifted to Pearl Harbor, where he was given a highly experimental radiation inhibitor. He's been on medical leave since the accident.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna need his medical records. The real ones.\nASTRID: We can't keep stalling, Doctor Bishop. You can't think of anything to do?\nWALTER: Maybe I could tell them that my stomach is troubling me.\nASTRID: That is not what I mean.\nPETER: Walter, I have Rusk's medical file here. Does any of that mean anything to you?\nWALTER: Radiation Poisoning -- That's why she had the seizure. The radiation and the synthetic treatments they gave him. I'd wager that's what kept his energy from dispersing.\nPETER: And you think that's how he was able to inhabit Lisa.\nWALTER: Which means we need more drugs. Uh, uh, to calm Lisa's conscious mind. To relax her brain. Which should enable Mr. Rusk's mental energy -- his memories -- to slowly and painlessly leave her mind.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: What kind of drugs?\nWALTER: Benzodiazepine. It's a hypnotic sedative. May cause a slight tingling sensation. It's actually quite pleasant. Besides, your daughter is 17. I'm sure she's sampled far worse by now. Agent Farnsworth, prepare an I.V. drip, uh, 100 mikes to begin per liter.\nPETER: (sitting with the teen and preparing a syringe) This is just gonna make you a little sleepy.\nLISA DONOVAN: So are you, like, a Doctor?\nPETER: No. But I promise you this won't hurt.\nLISA DONOVAN: It's okay. It's kind of nice to have someone not afraid of me.\nPETER: What do you mean?\nLISA DONOVAN: Well, my friends at church. When I walked past them, I could feel them all talking about me behind my back. Kids at school are even worse. Ever since what's happened, they think I'm, like, a freak or something.\nPETER: Well, I don't think you have to worry about us here. We're kind of partial to freaks in this lab.\nOLIVIA: (just arriving in the lab) How's it going?\nWALTER: It's smashing. (sits. milking his lab partner) Gene agrees with me, don't you, Gene?\nLISA DONOVAN: (privately to Peter) So is Agent Dunham, like, your girlfriend?\nPETER: No. No. She's like a friend who's a girl. And who carries a gun.\nOLIVIA:(softly) Walter, Astrid told me that you think you may be able to extract Rusk's thoughts from Lisa's brain.\nWALTER: I believe so. Yes.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, if that's the case, do you think that she would have access to his memories? Maybe describe his last moments.\nWALTER: Oh, you -- you want to find out who killed him.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nWALTER: Well. Well, let's see, shall we? (approaches the patient) Peter.\nPETER: Yeah.\nWALTER: Strap Lisa down, please.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Are straps really necessary?\nWALTER: It's just a precaution.\nPETER: (to Lisa) Just tell me if they're too tight, alright?\nLISA DONOVAN: Okay.\nWALTER: How are you feeling, Lisa?\nLISA DONOVAN: My toes are beginning to tingle and...\nWALTER: Oh, that's good. That means it's working.\nASTRID: Doctor Bishop, we're at six hertz.\nWALTER: Peter.\nPETER: Yeah.\nWALTER: Increase the drip two mikes, please.\nPETER: Done.\nLISA DONOVAN: I don't think I like how this feels.\nOLIVIA: Lisa, it's okay.\nLISA DONOVAN: No. No, I think I want this to stop.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Maybe we should slow this down.\nPETER: You know what, Lisa, this is actually normal. It's okay. Just relax. I'm gonna be right here. You're safe.\nWALTER: Lisa, just -- just close your eyes. Uh, mm. Close your eyes. This is going to help you. Now breathe. Breathe deeply. Just let it go, Lisa. Let it go.\nOLIVIA: Lisa. It's Agent Dunham. Can you hear me? Hi. I want you to think about Andrew Rusk.\nWALTER: Oh, oh, look, look, look. (graph needles jump) This is surprising.\nPETER: Surprising good or surprising bad?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Lisa! She's seizing!\nWALTER: No, she's not.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Lisa. You've gotta stop this right now.\nWALTER: I'm afraid we have to let it run its course.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Where am I?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Lisa. It's mom. I'm right here.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Who... is... Lisa? (fighting at straps)\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Why is she talking this way?\nWALTER: Because I believe this is not your daughter speaking any more.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: What is wrong with my daughter?\nWALTER: Appears that my hypothesis -- Lisa's mind was harboring Mister Rusk's memories -- was wrong. It would seem more likely that Mister Rusk's entire consciousness was transferred to Lisa.\nOLIVIA: His consciousness.\nWALTER: Perhaps his soul.\nPETER: Well, then where is Lisa?\nWALTER: Merely suppressed. Asleep in her own mind.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I want this stopped.\nWALTER: I'm afraid I can't do that.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: What do you mean you can't?\nWALTER: (whispering) We can't stop the experiment. The drugs have taken effect. We must let the experiment complete the system.\nASTRID: Listen, let's go out and get some air, Miss Donovan.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I can't leave her.\nWALTER: (almost scolding) Miss Donovan, you have asked me to help. Please let me do my work.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I can't lose her again.\nWALTER: (calmer) I understand. She's going to be fine. (Astrid and Maureen step out of the lab)\nOLIVIA: Can I talk to him? To Rusk?\nWALTER: I hope so. Maybe the only way to coax him out.\nOLIVIA: My name is Olivia. Do you know your name? I believe that somebody hurt you and I want to find out who that was.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Let me go!\nOLIVIA: Andrew. Andrew. Who killed you? Who did this to you?\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) I called my wife. Told her I was getting a beer. There was someone in my car. In the back seat. Told me -- \"pull over here. get out. walk. I said walk! Get on your knees!\" I'm not going out like that. Let me go! (fights at straps)\nOLIVIA: Andrew. Andrew! Who killed you? Give me a name.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Don't know his name. Just... his blood. His left arm.\nOLIVIA: Walter. Walter.\nWALTER: Peter, turn off the drip.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna call the local hospitals and see if anybody's gone in with an injured left arm.\nLISA DONOVAN: Peter.\nPETER: Hey. She's coming out of it!\nLISA DONOVAN:Hi.\nPETER: Hi.\nLISA DONOVAN: Did it work? Is he gone?\nPETER: Yeah. It's her. Let's get you out of this.\nOLIVIA: (aanswers cell phone) Dunham.\nCHARLIE: (calling from office) We got a hit. Jake Selleg, age thirty-six, walked into a Roxbury E.R. three nights ago. Lacerations on his left arm. You know, Liv, Jake Selleg was Navy too, okay? Now, he trained with SEAL Team Six. That's counter terrorism.\nOLIVIA: That can't be a coincidence. Is he local?\nCHARLIE: He works at a boxing gym in Dorchester.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Can you send me the address?\nCHARLIE: Sending it now.\nOLIVIA: I'll meet you there.\nCHARLIE: On my way.\nSPAR COACH: (to Selleg) That's it. (taking practice punches) Nice. Nice cross.\nOLIVIA: (to a random gym rat) 'scuse me. FBI. I'm Agent Dunham. This is Agent Francis. We're looking for a Jake Selleg. (is directed toward Selleg as he begins to flee)\nCHARLIE: (in pursuit) Hey! Stop! (out of the gym, down the street, tackles Selleg across the hood of a car in traffic. punches him as Olivia draws her pistol on the suspect)\nPETER: Lisa. Hey. (as she stares at the corpse of Rusk) Lisa, there's no need for you to be looking at that.\nLISA DONOVAN: This is him. Rusk.\nPETER: Yeah. Astrid's on her way back right now with your mom. Hopefully, you'll be able to put all this behind you in life and get back to normal soon.\nLISA DONOVAN: Can I have something to drink, please?\nPETER: Of course. (Gene moo's) Guessing you want something other than fresh cow's milk. (she nods yes) Okay. I'll be right back.\n(Walter sits and studies in a side office)\nPETER: Hey, Walter. You drink all the cream sodas again? What's wrong?\nWALTER: Lisa's brain scan. I think she's still sleeping.\nPETER: (reality checking his father) Maybe you should take a look out in the lab.\nWALTER: Well, her brain waves -- It appears that her signal is still being masked by Rusk's dominant pattern.\nPETER: Rusk is still in control? (returns to empty lab) Lisa?\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: (just returning to lab) Where is she? Where's my daughter?\nCHARLIE: (holds up evidence bag for Selleg to see) This is a slug we pulled from Andrew Rusk's head. Our ballistic unit's matching it as we speak from the 9 millimeter we found in your apartment.\nOLIVIA: I guess the Navy did a poor job training you to clean up after your work.\nCHARLIE: Hey. Who ordered you to kill Andrew Rusk?\nOLIVIA: Was he threatening to go public over the meltdown on the Gloucester? Did the Navy have you kill Andrew Rusk?\nJAKE SELLEG: I don't know what you guys are talking about. I spent seven years in the Navy and I never killed a man. But Andrew Rusk deserved it.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean he \"deserved it\"?\nJAKE SELLEG: For what that bastard did to his wife.\n(at the Rusk residence, Lisa has quietly infiltrated with a key hidden outside)\nCHARLIE: Rusk's wife. What does this have to do with her?\nJAKE SELLEG: I hang out at a bar she tends at. She told me about Andy. How he beats on her. One day she came in with a broken arm. She couldn't deal with it any more. No one should have to live like that.\nOLIVIA: Teresa Rusk hired you to kill her husband?\n(at the Rusk residence, Lisa locates and opens a lock box with a pistol in it)\nJAKE SELLEG: In the scrapyard, he kept asking me, why me? I pulled the trigger, but I made sure that I told him that it was Teresa who was sending him to Hell.\nOLIVIA: You said that to Rusk? Before you killed him, you told him his wife hired you?\nJAKE SELLEG: Yes, ma'am.\nCHARLIE: (to door guard) Okay. (to Olivia, walking from the room) Why didn't Rusk tell us that? He told us everything else. Why not that?\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nPETER: (calling from the lab) Olivia, Rusk is still controlling Lisa and she's gone.\nOLIVIA: I think I know where he's going. Rusk's wife had him killed. I think he's going for revenge.\nTERESA RUSK: What the hell are you doing in my house?\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Maya Svyozdichka.\nTERESA RUSK: What did you say to me? How -- how did you know to call me that? You're -- you're that girl. You -- you get out of here. I -- I have a gun.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Upstairs. In a safe. (aims pistol) This gun... that I got you from the service.\nTERESA RUSK: How do you... I -- I don't understand.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Well, neither do I. But I've been given a second chance, and I'm sure as hell not going to waste it. Now get down on your knees.\nTERESA RUSK: Okay.\n(Peter drives quickly to the Rusk house, Teresa is on the floor and has her hands taped)\nTERESA RUSK: Don't do this. Please!\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) You had me killed. (pours fuel around the room) Put down like a dog. I want to hear you say it.\nTERESA RUSK: I didn't have you killed. I don't know what you're talking about!\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) That's the thing about being with someone for twenty years, (empties fuel can) you know when they lie, how they lie. Admit what you did! (ignites match)\nTERESA RUSK: Don't.\nPETER: (cell phone call as he drives) Dunham. It's me. Where are you?\nOLIVIA: (answer call in her vehicle) We're five minutes out. Where are you?\nPETER: I'm just pulling up. (screeches to a halt in front of the Rusk house)\nTERESA RUSK: Please don't do this. Please!\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Admit that you had me killed. (Peter sneaks in quietly) Don't you want to die with a clean conscience?\nTERESA RUSK: Please! Don't!\nPETER: Stop! (Lisa blows out the lit match) Don't do this.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) I'll give you one chance to back out of here... (aims pistol at Peter) ...or we're all going out together.\nPETER: You know I can't do that.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) Then you're making a mistake. (taking serious aim)\nPETER: You don't have to do this.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) I already told you to leave once. I am not gonna tell you again.\n(Olivia and Charlie stop outside and race into the house)\nPETER: You know, I understand. What you said back at the lab. When I was in school, Lisa, I was different too. I was always sick. I didn't have any real friends.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) What the hell are you talking about?\nPETER: I'm telling you that I understand, Lisa.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) You got to stop calling me Lisa.\nPETER: I know what it feels like to feel different all the time.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) I'm gonna count to one.\nPETER: Lisa, listen to me. You've been given a second chance here, but you have to fight for it.\nLISA DONOVAN: (possessed voice of Rusk) One! (from behind, Charlie fires a syringed dart into her shoulder and she collapses)\n(outside the house as Lisa is wheeled to an ambulance)\nLISA DONOVAN: Peter.\nPETER: (walking by her side) Yeah?\nLISA DONOVAN: What happened?\nPETER: Well, I'll tell you all about it, but not right now, okay? Right now you need to rest.\nOLIVIA: So they're gonna take you to the hospital, and get you checked out, and make sure that everything's okay. And then they'll bring you back to the lab. And we'll meet you there. Okay.\nLISA DONOVAN: Okay. (as she is loaded into the ambulance)\nOLIVIA: How'd you know it would work, that you could reach her?\nPETER: Walter's book of Tibetan philosophy. Innermost subtle consciousness is ever present. It never leaves the body even in death.\nOLIVIA: You got a lot of mileage out of a coaster.\nPETER: Yeah. In other words, I threw up a Hail Mary.\nWALTER: Perfectly normal. Singular consciousness. (looking at brainwave graph) Lisa's.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Which means he's gone.\nWALTER: I believe so. I would propose that Mister Rusk stuck around to deal with unfinished business. And once he did, then, well, Lisa was free to finally purge herself of him.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: How can we be sure?\nWALTER: Nisi credideritis, non intelligentis.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: I don't understand.\nWALTER: It's a Latin translation of Isaiah 7:9.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: Unless you believe, you will not understand.\nWALTER: Even as a scientist, sometimes I have to rely on faith.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: God keep you and yours safe, Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: (humbly to Maureen) And you, ma'am. (disconnecting Lisa's electrodes) Come along, Lisa. Time to go home.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: You all set, sweetheart?\nLISA DONOVAN: Yeah. (heads for the exit)\nPETER: (surprised by a big hug from Lisa) Oh. Take care.\nMAUREEN DONOVAN: (to Olivia as she enters the lab) Thank you again, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: It's Olivia. And you're welcome.\nLISA DONOVAN: Thank you. (smaller hug)\nOLIVIA: Bye.\nLISA DONOVAN: (shares a little girl-girl advice) I'll be eighteen in a year. Don't wait too long to make your move. (leaves with her mom)\nOLIVIA: (joins her team as Rusk's corpse is being hauled away) Well, the Navy officially denied our request to launch an investigation into the U.S.S. Gloucester.\nPETER: Well, there's a shocking surprise.\nWALTER: Thinking about his shipmates, I shouldn't worry. I suggest that Mister Rusk's postmortem adventures will prove to be the exception rather than the rule. And if not, then we'll go into the exorcism business. (smiles and wanders away)\nPETER: Is it just me or did you detect a note of excitement in his voice? 'cause I for one cannot wait to get that guy out of here.\n(from the dark skies above, to the noisy, crowded, bright venue below)\nMALE REPSONDER: He just jumped the curve.\n(two vehicles have collided, one inverted on the hood of the other, the driver of one vehicle appears fatally wounded)\nEMT: I'm not getting a pulse on this guy.\nWOUNDED DRIVER: (suddenly gasps for air, life returning to his face) Maya Svyozdichka.\nMALE REPSONDER: What'd he say?\nEMT: I think he's speaking Russian."

What's that mean? ... yeah, I can hear her crying... Try that little rock-twist thing I do. That usually soothes her... It worked? Look at that... (notices a boy walking on the side of the road) ... Uh, sweetheart, I have to go... Yeah. Give here a kiss for me, would you? ... Okay, bye. (stops car near the boy) Hey there. Where you headed? What you doing out here all by yourself? What about your parents? Do they know you're out here?\nTEDDY FALLS: No, sir.\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: What's your name son?\nTEDDY FALLS: Teddy.\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: Why don't you hop in, Teddy? (Teddy sits in the back of the patrol car) So you were running away?\nTEDDY FALLS: Yeah.\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: Well, I took off a few times when I was your age. But I bet there's people out there worried, looking for you. And you know what? It doesn't matter what happened. I'm sure as soon as they see you... (looks in the mirror and sees the deformed face of the boy. He applies the brakes violently)\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: Oh, my god!\nTROOPER CASEY: Oh, God, if I wasn't looking at him myself, I wouldn't believe we caught one.\nTROOPER MADISON: I always thought they were nut jobs. The people who told those stories... Seeing is believing.\nTROOPER CASEY: Where'd he pick him up?\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: Just off of 940. A quarter mile down the road from Edina. Teddy, I'm gonna take your picture. Can you put your juice down and sit up for me?\nTROOPER CASEY: I think we should call the papers, Johnny.\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: He's just a kid.\nTROOPER MADISON: He's one of them. I don't care how old he is, people have a right to know.\nTROOPER JOHN PEKARSKY: We're not calling anyone until this thing goes through proper channels.\nTROOPER MADISON: How much you want to bet somebody in the proper channels leaks it to...\n(two men with shotguns burst into the room and shoot the three troopers)\nTEDDY FALLS (to Pekarsky wounded on the floor): I'm sorry. (one of the two men shoots Pekarsky again)\n(standing next to the passenger window and trying to coax his father from the station wagon)\nPETER: Walter, come on. Let's go.\nWALTER: Why do I have to go in there?\nPETER: Because we're out of milk. And because you haven't left the house in over a week, and you can't just stay inside watching old movies all the time.\nWALTER: Look at all those people, Peter. What if I get lost again? What if he's in there?\nPETER: Walter... He's not in there. And I promise you I will never let you get kidnapped again. Okay?\n(Peter opens the car door but Walter closes it immediately)\nWALTER: No. No. I'm learning to appreciate cowardice. The lion had a point.\nPETER: The lion?\nWALTER: The Cowardly Lion.\nPETER: But again, that was just a movie. And there's no flying monkeys inside the grocery store. (answers cell phone call) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey, can you be ready to go in half an hour? (walking briskly down a public sidewalk)\nPETER: Why? What's up?\nOLIVIA: Three dead cops and a missing kid.\nPETER: Doesn't really sound like our kind of case.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, well, wait 'til you hear about the kid.\nBROYLES: John Pekarsky was the Senior Trooper on duty last night. He uploaded his report to the State Police Database sometime after 9:00. According to the Coroner, Pekarsky and the other two troopers on duty were dead within the hour.\nPETER: And the kid? He was gone.\nBROYLES: I think whoever did this was coming for him.\nOLIVIA: They didn't leave any kind of trail.\nBROYLES: We haven't found a single print or shell casing. And they took the surveillance hard drive.\nPETER: But there was a picture of the kid?\nBROYLES: Pekarsky uploaded it along with his report.\nWALTER: I saw a boy who looked like this once. He was young, like this child, and he played the banjo, I think. It was a haunting melody. (Walter hums melody to Dueling Banjos - Peter continues the melody after him) Yes. You saw it too.\nPETER: Yes, I did. It's a movie, Walter. It's called Deliverance. We saw it together.\nWALTER: Probably not the same boy.\nOLIVIA: According to his report, this kid looked completely normal when Pekarsky picked him up.\nAGENT FRUG: Agent Broyles, we found something you might want to take a look at.\n(moving to another room)\nAGENT FRUG: We found it in their files. There are 30 or 40 reports in there. Strange stories about these deformed people.\nOLIVIA: Well, some of these are 30 years old. \"I saw him change in front of me. Suddenly he was hideous.\"\nBROYLES: Like Trooper Pekarsky reported. \"Misshapen and deformed. It looked like a cousin of Bigfoot.\"\nWALTER: That's clearly wrong. This boy bears no resemblance at all to a Sasquatch. Or a Yeti, for that matter.\nAGENT FRUG: Well, you don't... you don't believe in those creatures?\nWALTER: Why shouldn't I? Just because no one has documented flying monkeys or talking lions yet hardly means they don't exist.\nPETER: Agent Frug, my father's a bit of a shock-doc. Don't let him alarm you.\nOLIVIA: All of these reports were dismissed. There was no cooperation and no hard evidence. But the vast majority of them occurred in the same area. Just outside Edina.\nAGENT FRUG: That's where the boy was picked up, walking out of Edina.\nOLIVIA: I guess that's where we start looking.\nBROYLES: Dunham... whatever these things are, it seems like they've managed to hide themselves for a while. And from the looks of things, they'll do just about anything to keep it that way. Keep it in mind.\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir.\n(on the streets of Edina)\nWALTER: I don't think this is a good idea.\nPETER: It's okay, we're just gonna ask a couple of questions.\nWALTER: There may be werewolves in these hills.\nOLIVIA: Werewolves? Mm.\nWALTER: That trooper reported that the boy changed in front of his eyes. So yes, I believe we may be looking for some kind of therianthrope.\nPETER: It's greek. Refers to a creature that has a metamorphic ability to shift between being a man an a beast. It's mythological, of course.\nWALTER: I saw one once when I was a young man studying in London. I was under the influence of a fairly potent blend of hashish..\nOLIVIA: Guys, hang on a second. (low hum) Do you hear that? That buzz?\nWALTER (humming Prelude from Carmen) : \u00b6 hard artichokes rarely keep \u00b6 \u00b6 norwegian elephants \u00b6 \u00b6 singapore sleep \u00b6\nPETER: Hey, what-- what are you singing?\nWALTER: I have no idea. It just popped into my head. It must be that... that buzzing. I...I can't stop it. (continues humming)\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Sheriff Velchik. Hi. Thank you for meeting us on such short notice.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Oh, of course. I couldn't help but notice that you've gotten acquainted with the Edina hum.\nPETER: Yeah, what is that?\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Military base, about five miles down the road. They have a bunch of big turbine generators that get pretty loud from time to time.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's one mystery solved.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Why don't we have some coffee. Maybe I can help you with the other.\nOLIVIA: So I take it you've heard about what happened last night to the three troopers in Jonestown.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: I understand that the perpetrators took a kid.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\n(Olivia shows a picture of the kid)\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: My god.\nPETER: You've never seen anything like that before?\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: No. I've never seen a photograph of...one of them.\nPETER: Then you have heard the stories?\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Of course. Telling those stories is a bit of a local pastime. You hear 'em all over this part of the state.\nOLIVIA: Well Sheriff, this boy was picked up just outside of your town. And the State Police have 30 or 40 unconfirmed eyewitness reports.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Oh, yeah, we get our fair share of sightings, but I've never been able to confirm them. Nothing like this.\nOLIVIA: Well, we'd like to see those reports.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Of course. Anything I can do.\nROSE FALLS: What is it?\nJOSEPH FALLS: It's nothing.\nROSE FALLS: Joseph?\nJOSEPH FALLS: Federal agents came into the diner. They had a photograph of Teddy. And they're asking questions about the killings.\nROSE FALLS: I told you that wasn't the answer!\nJOSEPH FALLS: What choice did we have?\nROSE FALLS: Well, what are we gonna do?\nJOSEPH FALLS: I don't know yet.\n(Peter and Olivia on car phone talking to Broyles, Walter sleeping in the back)\nBROYLES: We didn't get anything from the autopsies. Looks like the troopers were killed with 12-gauge shotgun blasts.\nOLIVIA: But there's probably a shotgun in every house in this part of the state.\nBROYLES: You make a good point. You went through all the sheriff's reports?\nPETER: Yeah, they've had similar sightings, but nothing conclusive. Though Sheriff Velchik did mention a military base down the road.\nBROYLES: You floating another government conspiracy theory, Mr Bishop?\nPETER: You know me, I never miss a chance for a good conspiracy theory.\nBROYLES: Okay, I'll look into it.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) God, how far away is the hotel? I'm exhausted.\nPETER: I don't know. It's only supposed to be a couple more miles. (pointing to Walter) Though somebody's already decided to call it a night.\nOLIVIA: Well, he's had a big day. You got him out of the house he's working a case. (Walter snores softly)\nPETER: I understand why he's scared. But it just doesn't seem like he's able to snap out of it this time. It reminds me of how he was when we first got him out of St. Claire's. I'm worried that he's starting to go backwards.\nOLIVIA: I think he's starting to appear no less normal than the rest of us. I ran into a guy from high school this morning. You should have seen the look in his eyes when I told him what I did.\nPETER: Like chicks with guns turned him on?\nOLIVIA: More like I was a freak. Like I had suddenly grown a third eye. (chuckles) You ever get the feeling that doing this job just makes you less and less normal?\nPETER: Absolutely. (a vehicle going in the opposite direction suddenly crosses to their side of the road. car horn honks) Olivia! (tires screech, engine hissing, car leaves the road and stops in the woods) Olivia. (faint groaning, Olivia appears unconscious) Olivia! (Walter snores. Peter sees a truck stopping on the road, a man gets out with a shotgun and shoots in the direction of the car. Peter takes Olivia's gun and shoots back)\nWALTER: Are we there yet, Peter?\nPETER: Walter, get down! (a man is now behind the car and shoots again. Peter gets out of the car and shoots back. the man leaves in his truck)\nAGENT FRUG: All pretty quiet in this area. Not much in the way of dead cops and feds being run off the road.\nOLIVIA: But you think you shot it?\nPETER: Maybe. I don't know. But it was able to drive off.\n(cell phone rings)\nAGENT FRUG (on phone): Yeah... we'll be right there.\nAGENT FRUG: One of our agents just found an abandoned pickup truck on the side of the road about a mile from here. Back towards Edina.\n(they drive to where the truck was found)\nAGENT FRUG: Is that the vehicle?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. It was heading straight for us.\nAGENT FRUG: Do we have a preliminary? No plates, no registration. We have a forensic team on the way.\nOLIVIA: We should have them run the truck's VIN number, see if you can track down an owner.\n(Walter walks to the side of the road)\nWALTER: Peter. Peter.\nPETER: What? What is it?\nWALTER (looking at a butterfly): The large blue. Isn't she magnificent! I've never seen one this big on this continent. Look, Olivia. I know a certain lepidopterist who will be simply thrilled. I have to get my kit from the car.\n(Walter humming prelude from Carmen as he walks to the car)\nOLIVIA: Peter, look.\nPETER: It's blood.\n(they search in the forest)\nAGENT: Agent Frug, over here. We got something.\nWALTER: (as his son approaches a still body) Careful, Peter.\n(Peter flips the body over - the man was shot in the neck)\nAGENT FRUG: You said you shot at the creature, right?\nPETER: Yeah... Yeah.\nAGENT FRUG: You sure you saw what you think you saw?\nWALTER: Agent Frug, what happened here is simple. My son shot a beast. We found a man. Obviously the creature transformed in the interim. Peter, do you realize the significance of this? We may have found a creature with metamorphic ability. (humming) \u00b6 hard artichokes rarely keep \u00b6 \u00b6 norwegian elephants \u00b6 \u00b6 singapore sleep \u00b6\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) There was no I.D. on the guy so we're gonna run some prints. You had no choice. First time I killed someone, the guy was a trained killer. If I hadn't pulled the trigger, I'd be dead. I still didn't sleep that night. Or the next. I'm just saying the first time's rough.\nWALTER: Take the ramp down to the left.\n(cow moos)\nPETER: You're good. Just follow the mooing.\n(cell phone rings)\nOLIVIA: Dunham.\nBROYLES: Everyone okay there?\nOLIVIA: More or less. Thanks.\nBROYLES: I got a call from our military liaison. There's something to the rumors of military testing at Edina. Turns out the Army was there in the late '70s conducting a series of classified experiments.\nOLIVIA: Anything to do with metamorphic ability?\nBROYLES: Not that I can tell. The Pentagon files have been almost entirely redacted. I put a call into the D.O.D., but in the meantime I'm faxing what we have.\nPETER: Right down here. Just put it right here. Perfect. Thanks, fellas.\n(Olivia receives fax)\nWALTER: Agent Farnsworth, help me with my kit. I have to get to work, but there's a wonderful specimen in there for my favorite fan of four-winged fauna. I think you'll be quite tickled.\nOLIVIA (showing fax): Peter, look at this. The military experiment they did in Edina was called \"Project Elephant\".\nPETER: Walter's song.\nOLIVIA: Walter... were you involved in any military testing in Edina?\nWALTER: Not that I recall. I'm sure I'd remember something as exciting as human metamorphosis. (trying to unzip the body bag) Another one that won't unzip.\nASTRID: Ugh. Walter, it's very sweet of you to remember how much I love butterflies, but you forgot how much I hate moths.\nWALTER: What have you done to it?\nASTRID: Excuse me?\nWALTER: You saw it, Peter. It... it was an astounding creature! Nothing like this. It's wing is deformed.\nASTRID: Walter, if that's your idea of a joke, it's really not very funny. (she opens the body bag) Aah!\n(face of the dead man - now deformed)\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nWALTER: You'll want to add some wild thyme to the jar, dear. It's possible we could get the moth to transform back. It really was the most beautiful butterfly.\nASTRID: I'll believe that when I see it.\nPETER: Walter, I understand what you're saying about the moth and the man transforming in the same way, but I just don't understand how that could be possible.\nWALTER: It's likely that both developed the ability in response to the same experimental stimulus. Slide.\nPETER: (Peter passes a microscope slide to Walter) You mean the military testing.\nWALTER: Exactly.\nPETER: Well, why would the military be testing a butterfly?\nWALTER: A butterfly has two stages of life. It's one of the few creatures with a demonstrated ability to abruptly change its body structure. That makes it a wonderful alpha test subject. (looks at specimen on slide) That's odd.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: There's no sign of histolysis or histogenesis. Nothing to suggest a metamorphic ability. I just don't understand how he can possibly have transformed himself.\nOLIVIA: So we didn't get a match on the fingerprints, but we did get a hit with the truck's VIN number. It was registered to Joe Falls. But the address on the registration was old. The house had been torn down years ago.\nPETER: But he was from Edina?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Joe Falls? He worked at the mill. Still does odd jobs now and then. You think that that thing that tried to run you off the road-- you think that could be him?\nOLIVIA: It's possible. There was no photograph on his file, so we haven't been able to make a positive I.D. Do you have any idea where he's been living recently?\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: The last I heard, he'd moved to the outskirts of town. But I couldn't say where. I mean, I'm happy to ask around for you.\nOLIVIA: We'd also like to have a look at the town records. See if we can find a last known address or a photo so that we can I.D.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Sure. I'll take you over to Town Hall.\nWALTER: Did you finish the analysis on the blood sample from the moth?\nASTRID: Yes, I did. It had some sort of genetic disorder.\nWALTER: Ah, germline mutation. Just as I thought. This man has the exact same disorder.\nASTRID: Is that what you think let's them... transform?\nWALTER: No, the mutation is what makes them deformed. I have no idea what makes them transform.\nASTRID: Walter?\nWALTER: It's curious. I have this strange feeling that I've seen this mutation before. (humming prelude from Carmen)\nASTRID: Please, not that song again. It's giving me a headache.\nWALTER: Ah, yes... \u00b6 hard artichokes rarely keep \u00b6 \u00b6 norwegian elephants \u00b6 \u00b6 singapore sleep \u00b6 The testing at Edina... Project Elephant. I think that's where I've seen this mutation before. Maybe I did work on Project Elephant, like Agent Dunham said. Hmm. So why did I put them into a song?\nASTRID: Mmm. Wait a second. Walter, what are the words again?\nWALTER: \u00b6 hard artichokes rarely keep \u00b6 \u00b6 norwegian elephants \u00b6 \u00b6 singapore sleep \u00b6 singapore sleep.\nASTRID: Does \"harkness\" mean anything to you?\nWALTER: Harkness is a library at the law school... the song is a mnemonic, yes?\nASTRID: You must have done it on purpose, Walter.\nWALTER: Yes.\nASTRID: So what's at the law school library?\nWALTER: Come along, Astrid. Let's find out.\nPETER: There's nothing in the housing records on a Joe Falls.\nOLIVIA: There's nothing in the tax records either. In fact, the whole \"f\" section is gone. Anyone whose last name starts with \"f.\"\nPETER: You can't just walk in and check these records out.\nOLIVIA: No, but you can steal them. Let's check the federal records. If you lived here, you must be on the census.\nWALTER: This is it. I remember now.\nASTRID: Walter... what happened to you in Edina? You're like a different person since you got back.\nWALTER: I've always found work to be restorative. When Peter was sick, it was the only thing that kept me going. Amazing how it heals the soul.\n(Walter removes a plate below a library shelf)\nWALTER: Oh, look. (he takes out a box) Devil Dogs. I loved these.\nASTRID: Walter, we can get you a fresh one.\n(he takes out another box containing files with photographs of deformed people)\nWALTER: Oh, my, oh...\nASTRID: They're deformed. Just like that man in the lab.\nWALTER: I understand now.\nOLIVIA: There's nothing on Joe Falls in 1990. Anything in 2000?\nPETER: Uh-uh. Anything in there on the current population of Edina?\nOLIVIA: Uh, 1,943. It was on the sign. Why?\nPETER: I don't know, there's just something strange about these census numbers. Between the years of 1990 and 2000, 17 people died, 47 people were born. That's the only change in the population.\n(cell phone rings)\nOLIVIA (on phone): Sheriff. Uh, some of your tax files are missing. Uh, all of the section \"f\", including Falls.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: I may know who's responsible. The local tax collector said that Falls had moved out to the edge of town. He's living in a trailer with his wife and his son.\nOLIVIA: How old is the boy?\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: He said he was seven or eight. I've got an address if you want to meet me.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks. We'll see you there.\n(a crowd has gathered in front of the town hall, waiting for sheriff Velchik)\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: They don't know anything. There's nothing to worry about. It's going to be fine.\nROSE FALLS: You're wrong, Paul. They found out.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Rose, I know you have a special interest in this, but they don't know anything.\nROSE FALLS: They have a photograph. They have proof.\nSHERIFF VELCHIK: Others have come before. I'm gonna take care of this. I'll make it all go away.\n(Astrid drives the Bishop station wagon as they approach the Edina city limit sign)\nASTRID: ...the man and the moth -- didn't transform at all?\nWALTER: No, this is something else entirely. In the late '70s, the Army became obsessed with finding a new way to camouflage soldiers. They started experimenting with electromagnetic pulses.\nASTRID: As their camouflage?\nWALTER: The eye converts electromagnetic energy into something the brain can understand. That's how vision works. Well, the Army thought that if they could generate a massive electromagnetic pulse, then they could effectively scramble the optic nerve... and at the right frequency, make the soldiers invisible to the naked eye.\nASTRID: And you consulted on this project?\nWALTER: Briefly. It was after I left that they realized that prolonged exposure to the pulse has a horrible side effect. An incurable genetic disorder. And this moth and that deformed man are the victims -- or the children of the victims of that experiment.\nASTRID: So how does that explain their ability to change, Walter?\nWALTER: Here, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop here. (she pulls the vehicle over the shoulder, stops, both exit the car and walk forward to the sign) Come. Come. Leave the lights on.\nASTRID: Walter. Walter, what are you doing?\nWALTER: Ah... What do you see?\nASTRID: I see the moth.\nWALTER: Come here, please. (she steps closer and the moth visibly changes to a butterfly) Now what do you see? A friend of mine once wrote that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\nASTRID: How is it doing that?\nWALTER: It isn't. The man and the moth don't change at all. What changes is our perception of them.\nPETER: (on cell phone speaker, calling from Olivia's car as she drives) Walter -- Walter, slow down. You're saying that this electromagnetic pulse allows us to see these deformed people as if they were normal?\nWALTER: (on cell phone with Astrid walking nearby) Yes. Somebody must have perfected the military's camouflage technology to hide the deformities that the first tests created.\nPETER: So then so long as we stay within the range of the pulse...\nWALTER: ...then these poor souls appear totally normal.\nOLIVIA: (on speaker call) So that's the Edina hum. That's the sound that the pulse makes.\nWALTER: Yes. Yes, I believe so.\nOLIVIA: Walter, do you know who could have perfected this technology?\nWALTER: No, no. It would be extremely difficult. Apart from Cobb, no one else would have the expertise.\nPETER: Cobb? Who's Cobb?\nWALTER: Edward Cobb was the scientist who dreamed up Project Elephant. He would be the only one with the imagination and the know-how.\nPETER: Listen, Walter, I want you and Astrid to head back home.\nWALTER: But -- but given my knowledge...\nPETER: Walter, listen to me. Somebody obviously has a lot invested in keeping this thing a secret. They've killed three people already -- they tried to kill us. I don't want to have to worry about you.\nWALTER: Oh, well, that's -- that's very sweet of you, son.\nPETER: I'll see you back at home (end of cell phone conversation)\nASTRID: What did Peter say?\nWALTER: He wants us to head into town to try and find the source of the electromagnetic pulse.\nROSE FALLS: (marches into the office as Velchik and his Deputy are loading their weapons) There's been too much bloodshed already. It's just making things worse.\nPAUL VELCHIK: You got your boy back. Would you rather we'd let them keep him?\nROSE FALLS: You're killing innocent people. It's time to give this up. There are real consequences.\nPAUL VELCHIK: Sure. There are real stakes here. That's why you gotta let me do my job and keep this town safe.\nROSE FALLS: And you think that killing those federal officers is the best way to put a stop to this?\nPAUL VELCHIK: It did the last time. That Federal Marshal a few years ago-- no one came looking for him, did they? We've all got jobs to do, Rose. Stick to the machine. That's your job. (leaves with his Deputy and weapons)\nASTRID: (talking as she drives) Walter... what kind of device are we looking for?\nWALTER: Any number of things could transmit the pulse. A large capacitor bank. Some form of compression generator.\nASTRID: What about a satellite dish? They have them all over town.\nWALTER: ...oh, no. Those are for television, dear. Given how little there is to do here, I imagine they watch a lot of it. What we're looking for is something that could relay the discharge from the microwave conversion of large energy pulses.\nASTRID: What about a -- a big antenna?\nWALTER: Yes, yes, that would do, I suppose.\nASTRID: (pointing to the right of the car) Something like that? (stops the vehicle in front of the Falls residence)\nWALTER: Well done, Astricks.\n(standing at the front door, he knocks)\nASTRID: Are you sure we should just knock on the door like this?\nWALTER: Rose. That was Edward's daughter. He used to carry her around the lab on his shoulders. (to young Teddy, after the boy opens the door) Oh, hello. Is your mother home?\nTEDDY FALLS: No.\nWALTER: Ah. But your mother is Rose? And your grandfather, his name was Edward Cobb?\nTEDDY FALLS: Who are you?\nWALTER: I'm Walter Bishop. Your grandfather was a friend of mine. May we come in? (opens the screen door, enters with Astrid and enters the sitting room. eyes an old picture in a frame) Look, look. That's Edward Cobb. ...and, and, and that's Rose.\nASTRID: Mm.\nWALTER: (to the boy) Do you have more recent pictures of your mother?\nTEDDY FALLS: We don't own a camera.\nWALTER: No, of course. Cameras have no optic nerve. The photos would only show their deformities.\nTEDDY FALLS: You have to go. I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house.\nWALTER: Quite right. But may I use your bathroom?\nTEDDY FALLS: You know my mother will be home soon. You should go.\nWALTER: We will. First I'll go, and then we'll go. But where's the bathroom?\nTEDDY FALLS: Down the hall, second door on the left.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nASTRID: (distracting the child with polite conversation) Is that Operation? (board game) Oh, I loved this game.\nOLIVIA: Joe Falls is in his thirties, so he's too young to be one of the soldiers they tested in that experiment.\nPETER: Yeah, it would have had to have been his father.\nOLIVIA: I guess folks with that kind of deformity don't tend to leave home. (Peter reviews his charts) You still stuck on that census data?\nPETER: There's just something weird about these numbers. I went back thirty years, and it looks like the only time the population goes down is when somebody dies.\nOLIVIA: What about when people move? (stops vehicle)\nPETER: No, that's just it. They don't. Nobody ever leaves this town.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying that you think they're -- that everyone in Edina is one of them?\nPETER: (sees an approaching patrol car. the Deputy is hanging out the window with a shotgun pointed at them. to Olivia) Get down!\n(as they duck, the front windshield erupts from a shotgun blast)\n(ambushed and running from the Sheriff and his Deputy, a shotgun blasts behind them... they find cover in a nearby barn)\nPETER: (running quickly) ...we'll take cover in the barn!\nOLIVIA: Go! Go!\n(back at the Fall's residence, Walter hears a low hum and follows the sound into the basement of the house)\n(in the barn now, Olivia continues to exchange fire with the two Jonestown County officers as she and Peter seek refuge)\nASTRID: (playing Operation with Teddy at the Falls house) Oops. (as the boy fails the game) My turn. I'm going for '\"The Wishbone. (Walter kills the generator in the basement and the hum fades. Astrid -holding her tongue- can now see the boy as he truly is... genetically disfigured)\nWALTER: (returning to the sitting room and noticing the uncamouflaged young lad playing with Astrid) Oh, my.\n(still avoiding the ambush attack in the barn, Olivia shoots Deputy Bill as he enters, then avoids shotgun blasts as the Sheriff charges into the barn)\nPETER: (not wanting to be a shot by a startled Olivia) Easy! Easy! It's just me.\nPAUL VELCHIK: (to Olivia) Drop the gun. I said drop the gun.\nROSE: (steps from the shadows and pumps her shotgun) Paul.\nPAUL VELCHIK: Go home, Rose. (then quickly blasted by Rose)\nROSE: (quietly in her sitting while Teddy sits on the porch with Astrid) The original pulse deformed the whole town. My father couldn't live with himself afterwards. He couldn't leave all those people like that.\nOLIVIA: According to our files, your father resigned from his commission in 1979.\nROSE: Yes. He came back to Edina and worked tirelessly on his machine until he perfected it. Then he offered the inhabitants a choice.\nPETER: A choice?\nROSE: Live as you are, deformed, but free to roam the world or confine yourself to Edina, where the pulse will allow you to hide in broad daylight.\nOLIVIA: And the people voted to stay.\nROSE: They realized the pulse would allow them to look beyond the horror of their deformities and see each other for who they really were. They chose the only normal life they could have.\nPETER: And your father? He chose to stay among you.\nWALTER: He chose because of you, didn't he, Rose? Last time I saw you, you were a little girl. (looks at picture) A perfectly healthy little girl.\nROSE: My mother and I, we lived in Edina. We were part of the experiment.\nOLIVIA: Your father experimented on you?\nROSE: No. The Army never told him they were expanding the scope of the test.\nWALTER: Rose, I remember your father fondly. He believed that invisibility would save lives. And he finally solved the problem.\nROSE: My father tried to create a good life for me here -- for all of us-- and he succeeded.\n(Walter walks out alone and catches Broyles as he arrives)\nBROYLES: (greeting him) Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: You can't make this public, Agent Broyles. We need to let them keep their secret.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, three state troopers were killed...\nWALTER: ...and those responsible were brought to justice. But the rest of these people... you have no idea what will happen to them.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop...\nWALTER: They will have no choice but to study these people. To examine them, to test them, to humiliate them.\nBROYLES: (pausing) Doctor Bishop, did you find the machine? The one that transforms them?\nWALTER: Please, Agent Broyles. These people have been harmed enough. We simply can't...\nBROYLES: ...Doctor Bishop... I don't think you're understanding me. If you didn't find the machine, there's nothing to report.\nWALTER: (growing wiser) Thank you. (as the Feds drive out of town)\nWALTER: remarkable... How Rose was willing to expose her secret to right a wrong. How very brave of her.\nPETER: You did something brave too. The way you spoke up for those people -- you didn't have to do that, Walter. I'm proud of you."

Gonna be a nice one today.\nRADJAN VANDENKEMP: Yeah, yeah, I think so.\nMIKE: Man, you don't look so good. Are you okay? Hey, Linda, I think something's wrong with that guy.\nLINDA: Sir, you have to sign in.\nVINCENT AMES: Linda, call 9-1-1.\nMIKE: (administering CPR pulse to chest) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - - He's... he's dead.\n\u00b6 the wheels on the bus go round and round \u00b6 \u00b6 round and round, round and round... \u00b6\nSCIENCE CENTER WORKER: May I help you?\nASTRID: Yes, uh, I'm looking for someone who seems to have gotten lost.\nSCIENCE CENTER WORKER: Okay, what school is he from?\nASTRID: He's not from any school. He's a man. His name is Doctor Walter Bishop.\nSCIENCE CENTER WORKER: Hmm, I see. A special needs individual.\nASTRID: Heh, you have no idea.\nWALTER: When the Victoria, the last surviving ship, returned to its harbor of departure after the first circumnavigation of the Earth, only 18 of the original 237 men were on board.\nGIRL: What happened to them?\nWALTER: They all died, young lady. Horrible and most likely painful deaths. You see, when you open new doors, there is a price to pay. Now imagine... tonight, you look under your bed, and, lo and behold, you find a monster! And you're immediately eaten. Now, if you hadn't looked for the monster, you wouldn't have found it, and you'd still be happy in your beds, instead of being slowly digested in the stomach sack of the creature. But, with any luck, your sisters or your brothers might have heard your screams, and your endeavor will serve as a valuable lesson for them.\nTEACHER: Excuse me, do you work here?\nWALTER: No, I'm a -- a season pass holder. But thank you. Doctor Walter Bishop. They had no right to revoke my membership. No right.\nASTRID: Walter, you terrified those kids.\nWALTER: These children should know the truth.\nASTRID: Hello. Agent Dunham?\nWALTER: They're tragically coddled and ill-advised.\nASTRID: Have you already told Peter? Okay... we'll be there right away. Come on.\nOLIVIA: Detective, I'm Agent Dunham. This is Peter Bishop.\nKASSEL: Detective Kassel. We've been taking witness statements, trying to figure out what went down.\nOLIVIA: Is the M.E. here yet?\nKASSEL: On his way. It's a Dutch license.\nPETER: Radjan Vandenkemp.\nKASSEL: I've never seen anything like this.\nPETER: Lucky you.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) I'm gonna talk to some of the witnesses. (to female officer) I'm Agent Dunham with the F.B.I.\nFEMALE OFFICER: (to Olivia) Hi. (to Linda) I'll let you two talk.\nOLIVIA: (to female officer) Thank you. (to Linda) Uh... did he have an appointment here at Vitas?\nLINDA: Mm - mm. No one knew him. No one was expecting him. I don't even think he knew where he was going himself. He got off the elevator, seemed confused, and then collapsed.\nPETER: (On the phone) Okay, thanks. (To Olivia) It's Broyles. He's downstairs. He's gonna run VandenKemp and see what he can come up with.\nOLIVIA: Well, see, he didn't know anybody here, and this doesn't seem like the kind of business that you just walk into.\nVINCENT AMES: Excuse me. Can I ask a question?\nOLIVIA: Sure, Mister...\nVINCENT AMES: Uh, Ames. Vincent Ames. I'm the VP of Geotechnical Engineering. Will we be able to leave soon?\nOLIVIA: Not yet, I'm afraid.\nVINCENT AMES: Do we know what happened to him yet?\nOLIVIA: That's what we're trying to figure out. But we'll let you know as soon as you can leave.\nLINDA: (To Olivia) Mike, the courier rode up with him.\nOLIVIA: Which one's Mike?\nLINDA: He's sitting right over here.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, Agent Farnsworth. Got a deceased male, age fifty. We believe he's from the Netherlands. Walked into Vitas Petrol at 7:30 this morning, and his veins ruptured.\nWALTER: Oh! Oh, I see. Well, uh, vasculitis could be a cause. Or, uh, an arteriovenous fistula, which is an abnormal channel between the vessels. Extremely high blood pressure results, resulting in swelling of the veins.\nASTRID: Until they rupture?\nWALTER: No, no, not usually. But then, that's why we're here, I imagine. Don't, no, don't! This building must be quarantined immediately. No one goes in or out. I believe we have a contagion on our hands.\nASTRID: But Olivia and Peter -- They'll be trapped inside.\nWALTER: Quarantine the building, Agent Broyles.\nWALTER: I need to find out more about the first victim, Peter. The Dutchman. If I can find out where he came from, where he was, then I could begin to ascertain what could have infected him.\nPETER: Walter, we don't know yet.\nWALTER: Well, who was he coming to see? Someone up there must know him. Know something.\nPETER: Walter?\nWALTER: The CDC is here. You be careful up there, son.\nPETER: I will. (To Olivia) The CDC is here.\nASTRID: Walter, it's gonna be okay.\nWALTER: We should get to work.\nVINCENT AMES: Why are the police holding us here?\nPETER: We think we're in the midst of a virus contamination. The Centers for Disease Control are here.\nVINCENT AMES: Are you saying we're quarantined?\nOLIVIA: For now, yes.\nLINDA: What happened to Mike?\nOLIVIA: He was infected.\nELAINE: Is he... dead?\nKARL: He was closest to him. He was right over the guy.\nOFFICE WORKER: You were there too, Karl. You were there next to the courier. And Devon and Vincent. You all got his blood on you.\nELAINE: Then why aren't they sick too? How do you explain that?\nOFFICE WORKER: I don't know, Elaine. But I'm sure it's just a matter of time. They shut down the airflow.\nOLIVIA: I asked Detective Kassel to take care of it. It's protocol... in case the virus is airborne. We don't want it to spread through the building. So I'm gonna need to separate you into groups. Those who were near VandenKemp, if you could gather in one of the boardrooms. It's just a precaution until we know what this is and how it's being spread.\nPETER: Come on, let's go!\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Agent Broyles, Arnold McFadden, Field Director, CDC. I understand you've got two people up there. Do we know yet whether this is the result of a bioterrorism event?\nBROYLES: We're looking into that possibility as we speak, but nothing yet.\nCDC ASSISTANT: You wanted me?\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Let's get a team into the lobby. Get blood work underway. Cut a two-block radius with barriers.\nWALTER: I will need at least half a dozen of those samples, young man.\nBILL HUBERT: Excuse me, who are you?\nWALTER: ...and take me to your centrifuge.\nASTRID: Agent Broyles, uh, Walter has been arrested.\nWALTER: Agent Broyles, thank God you're here. Please tell these men to release me.\nPOLICE OFFICER: He breached the security line. Claims he's F.B.I., but he's got no credentials or identification.\nWALTER: I said I was a consultant.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop works with us. His son Peter is inside the building.\nWALTER: I need to get back to the lab. I'm trying to determine what pathogen I'm dealing with. And I need a blood sample -- something to work with.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: I can understand your wanting to assist, Doctor, but I have a great deal of experience with pathogens.\nWALTER: ...and I was Chairman of Biochemistry at Harvard and have little patience for small-minded bureaucrats.\nBROYLES: Walter... that's not helping.\nWALTER: I - I'm sorry. We need more information. My son tells me that several people got blood on them from the infected man. But only one of them died. Why him? Why aren't the others showing symptoms? I must get back to my lab and find out.\nBROYLES: No matter what your impressions are of Doctor Bishop, I assure you he's a valuable asset.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Hubert - you will escort Doctor Bishop to his lab with samples that you will not let out of your sight.\nWALTER: Thank you. Thank you. Quickly, get your pajamas off and -- come on, let's go! Come on. Come on.\nOLIVIA: You know, I can't find the name VandenKemp anywhere in this database.\nPETER: But he must have been here to see somebody. How far back did you go?\nOLIVIA: Two months.\nPETER: They're all calling their families. Wanna call your sister? Just to let her know what's going on?\nOLIVIA: What do you make of this? This guy, Ames, he had two appointments this morning, but he cleared his calendar last minute yesterday. But he's here.\nPETER: That doesn't necessarily mean anything.\nOLIVIA: ...and it doesn't necessarily not mean anything, either.\nDETECTIVE KASSEL: Guys... we have a problem.\nLINDA: What's happening to me?\nPETER: Come on in here. I want you to lay down and just try and rest and relax as best you can, okay?\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna get you some water.\nLINDA: Thank you. Thank you.\nPETER: Be right back.\nOLIVIA: So how much time do you think she has?\nPETER: I don't know, the courier died... maybe a half hour after giving VandenKemp CPR.\nELAINE: She's sick?\nOLIVIA: I'm afraid so.\nOFFICE WORKER: But she didn't get any of the blood on her.\nOLIVIA: You don't know that for sure.\nELAINE: She didn't! She was nowhere near him when he died! Which means we could all have it.\nPETER: But we don't know that. She was friends with the courier, right? Maybe he touched her. He could have infected her. The fact is, we just don't know. But it's important that we all stay calm.\nOLIVIA: Can I talk to you in private, Mister Ames? Okay, I know Mister VandenKemp was here to see you. Your schedule was rearranged yesterday and your morning was cleared out. Why was he here?\nVINCENT AMES: He came here to sell me some information from one of our competitors.\nOLIVIA: What kind of information?\nVINCENT AMES: All he said was it was from a recent reserve find.\nOLIVIA: Well, it's possible that VandenKemp came in contact with the virus there, so do you know which oil reserve? Which competitor was it?\nVINCENT AMES: He wouldn't say. All he said was, 'I have something to show you'. Something I would find very valuable. He was supposed to be gone before the staff came in this morning.\nOLIVIA: Well, where is it, the information?\nVINCENT AMES: I don't know. He didn't have anything with him. It's a very competitive business, Agent Dunham. I know what I did breaks a dozen Federal laws, but I'd rather go to prison than die here.\nOLIVIA: Well, it may be too late to trade one for the other now, Mister Ames.\nBROYLES: Radjan VandenKemp was an oil consultant. He arrived at Logan three days ago on a flight from Dubai. We've already contacted 174 of the 212 passengers on board. No one's shown any signs of infection.\nOLIVIA: Were you able to track his movements?\nBROYLES: He was staying at a Continental Inn. We have agents at the hotel. No symptoms reported there either, but also no indication of any information he was selling.\nOLIVIA: Have you heard from Walter? Has he been able to identify the virus?\nBROYLES: No, not yet, but I'll let you know when I do.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWALTER: If we can isolate the strain, we may be able to understand this virus's personality.\nASTRID: The personality? Walter, it's not a person.\nWALTER: Centrifuge is over there. No, viruses are not people, Astrid. But they seem to have minds of their own. The rabies virus can't survive in water. So it inflicts its host with a paralyzing fear of water.\nASTRID: Walter, that sounds...\nWALTER: Heh, trust me, I know how it sounds. It's almost beyond belief. The more we learn about viruses, the more unbelievable they become. They deny our definitions of living and dead. And their only function seems to be to survive, to replicate. And they use us as a vehicle to do so. It's the folly of humans to believe we're at the top of the food chain. In truth, viruses are.\nBILL HUBERT: The strain won't isolate. The sample was too fragile.\nWALTER: Damn it. I was afraid of that. Well, this is one piece of good news. I believe the virus is not airborne.\nASTRID: No?\nWALTER: No. If it were, there'd be many more people showing signs of infection in that building. We need a better sample.\nPETER: Broyles have anything?\nOLIVIA: No. Whatever VandenKemp was trying to sell, they can't find it.\nPETER: You able to get a hold of Rachel?\nOLIVIA: No. I didn't try. She just went through all this stuff with me in the hospital, and she's still having nightmares about me being dead. What's the point in scaring her again? We are gonna get out of this.\nPETER: That's just like you. Even now, you're protecting her. I thought that was the point of having people who care about you in your life... to have someone to talk to when you're scared.\nOLIVIA: She's out. The receptionist.\nLINDA: Aaaah!\nOLIVIA: Peter... Dunham.\nBROYLES: What the hell's happening up there?\nOLIVIA: Peter, be careful. Peter. Peter, no!\nPETER: Can't wait any longer.\nOLIVIA: Stop it! Get away from him now!\nPETER: I got his blood on me. If I wasn't infected before, I probably am now.\nOLIVIA: Peter, this is insane!\nPETER: They're down there and we're up here. And they're not sending anybody else up. This is our last chance to figure out whatever it was that he came here to try and sell. Rental car keys. Never take anything into a negotiation that can land you in jail. Always leave it in neutral territory.\nBROYLES: The CDC is opening the briefcase now.\nWALTER: You said his car was found in a garage nearby. It's underground?\nBROYLES: That's right.\nWALTER: I believe I have a hypothesis as to how this virus behaves.\nBROYLES: Go on.\nWALTER: Well, the receptionist had a very different reaction to the virus than the other two victims. And I believe I know why. This virus... has to spread itself, but in order to do so, it needs other organisms to infect. VandenKemp arrived alone at the building, and it wasn't until he was in an office full of people that he sprayed. B-but... having successfully infected other people, I believe that the virus now senses that it's contained within the building, and -- and it wants to get outside to continue spreading.\nBROYLES: The virus wants to get outside?\nWALTER: Yes, yeah.\nBROYLES: Doesn't that strike even you as a bit far-fetched?\nWALTER: No... the courier only spewed as he approached the glass doors. And from what you've said, the receptionist showed an irrational desire to get outside, and then she sprayed. The virus compelled her to leave the building. It wanted to get outside.\nBROYLES: You're saying the virus made her jump.\nWALTER: Yes. Yes! I believe so.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Among other things in the briefcase, we found a drill core sample from an exploratory oil dig. This is our virus.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: The sample was stolen from Solum Oil Corp. By normal procedure, it would have been stored in an airtight, protective case.\nBROYLES: Which suggests VandenKemp may have removed it in order to smuggle it out.\nWALTER: Do those documents indicate how far down it came from?\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: It came from ten miles down.\nWALTER: In that case, I believe we're in the presence of a 75,000-year-old terror. One that might have been responsible for wiping out the ice age mammals. Some things are meant to be left alone.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, can you find a cure for it?\nWALTER: Maybe, in time. But right now, we need to keep the safe people safe. Now that I have an isolated sample, I can produce a tox screen. At least we can identify who's been infected.\nTV MOVIE: Would diamonds or emeralds do?\nBILL HUBERT: Agent Dunham, Bill Hubert, CDC.\nOLIVIA: Hi. So, uh, how do you want to do this?\nWALTER: Two groups. We divide alphabetically.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I can do that -- 'a' through 'm's, if you come with me. And the rest can go with Agent Hubert.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Call the State Department. Get approval for a Level-Six eradication.\nCDC ASSISTANT: Level Six?\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: We don't know how to contain it. If anybody on the outside got infected...\nSTEVE: Thank you.\nPETER: No problem. How we doing in here?\nOLIVIA: We're just getting started.\nASTRID: First up, Vincent Ames.\nVINCENT AMES: Ho-how will I know?\nWALTER: If you're infected, the solution will turn black. Swab. Please swab the inside of your cheek. Amber. You're clear.\nOLIVIA: We'll be in touch.\nASTRID: Alright, next is Peter, and then Olivia.\nPETER: Ladies first.\nWALTER: Swab your cheek. You're not infected. Peter. You're okay. You're okay. Okay. Okay. Next.\nPETER: Okay, let's get this first group downstairs. You guys, come with me. Let's go.\nCDC SUIT#1: This is the first batch of uninfected from both testing groups. Nona Norris. Lauren Nossel. Glen Paulsen. Vincent Ames. Olivia Dunham. Peter Bishop.\nCDC SUIT#2: Wait, stop! He's bleeding from the nose. He's infected.\nPETER: I just have to get outside.\nCDC SUIT#2: Stop him! Get him away from the door!\nPETER: I just have to get outside! Uhh! I just have to get outside.\nSTEVE: I'm infected?\nWALTER: I'm afraid so.\nSTEVE: But I wasn't near anyone.\nDETECTIVE KASSEL: Steve, you need to come with me.\nPETER: Olivia, please! Please, you've got to open this door.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I can't. You know that.\nPETER: Look at me. Just look at me. I'm fine. Just look at me.\nOLIVIA: Peter...\nPETER: Olivia... Olivia!\nWALTER: Amber. You're clear.\nASTRID: Olivia, we just finished the tox screens.\nOLIVIA: Peter is infected.\nASTRID: Peter?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, the test was wrong. I-I don't know how, but... but he's bleeding from his nose and he's still in the building.\nASTRID: Okay.\nWALTER: What was that about Peter?\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: The Cambodian Outbreak of '04... killed 7,300 people, most of which could have been avoided if the Chinese authorities had moved quicker. That was Level Four. This is classified as Six. Right now, it's the only option.\nOLIVIA: Uh, they finished the tox screens.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: I heard. 11 civilians infected, and your colleague. I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: So what do we do now?\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Extract the rest of the ones that tested negative, and the State department has authorized us to have the Army move in and contain the rest.\nOLIVIA: The Army?\nBROYLES: Dunham.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: It's the only definitive way to make sure that the virus is eradicated.\nOLIVIA: There are still a dozen people in that building. You cannot tell me that killing them is our only option.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Come with me. Run it for her. This model is based on just one of those people getting out and infecting someone on the outside. This is two weeks from now. We have no symptom blocker, no cure. What solution do you propose, Agent Dunham?\nASTRID: Walter... Walter, you can't take that off.\nWALTER: It doesn't matter. The virus isn't airborne. It's transmitted by bodily fluids -- blood, saliva.\nASTRID: Walter, we are going to figure this out. Peter's gonna be fine.\nBILL HUBERT: It's time to go. We're taking all non-infected personnel out of the building -- now.\nASTRID: Walter, we'll have to help Peter from outside. Come on, Walter, let's go.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, where are you?\nASTRID: Walter won't leave. He thinks he can come up with a cure.\nOLIVIA: Does he have any idea how to do that?\nASTRID: No, not yet.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, they're giving up. The-- the CDC doesn't want to risk contamination, so they're planning on killing everyone inside. You can't be in there.\nASTRID: Walter will figure something out. We're gonna be fine.\nOLIVIA: Astrid...\nWALTER: What did Agent Dunham want?\nASTRID: Nothing.\nWALTER: Help me drag this Dutchman into the kitchen. There's a table in there, and a sink. Homo sapiens persevered 100 millennia ago. So something must have killed this virus. Slower metabolisms, evolving blood types. Unless the wretched virus isn't organism-specific. If I had an animal, a cat or a mouse... No. No, no, no. No, there's no time for that, of course.\nASTRID: Walter... What can I do?\nWALTER: I can't let Peter die again. He's going to. They all will. There's nothing I can do about it.\nASTRID: Walter, do you remember this morning? What you said at the Science Museum. You said that Magellan set sail around the world with a crew of 237 people.\nWALTER: 237. Nearly all of whom died.\nASTRID: Yeah, but 18 of them didn't. That's what you said, Walter. Despite the odds, 18 of them came back to their families.\nWALTER: The rest died of scurvy. A slow, horrific death. Uncontrollable diarrhea, pustulous bleeding. They all died. Except... we're still here. 75,000 years ago, our virus here wiped the planet clean. Then life resumed. So something... must have killed the active virus. Ash.\nASTRID: Astrid.\nWALTER: No... ash. Mount Toba... the biggest volcanic eruption for the last 25 million years. It blocked out the sun. Sulfuric ash rained down all around the world. Sulfur. Sulfur! That could be it.\nASTRID: Where do we get sulfur?\nWALTER: Open the fridge. Now, tell me what we've got to work with.\nASTRID: Um...There's diet soda. There's relish, there's, uh... there's yogurt, there's string cheese, there's horseradish, there's milk...\nWALTER: ...ooh, horseradish! Horseradish, good. Grab that. The glycoside in horseradish is high in sulfur. If I'm right, this should attack the virus. Thank you.\nOLIVIA: Sulfide diluted to four parts per million.\nWALTER: Then apply heat to catalyze the base. 1.5 CC's should be enough.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I got it.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: After we've notified the families of the deceased, we'll release a statement. The virus has been controlled. And we don't have any fear of a further outbreak.\nOLIVIA: Walter found a cure.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: I'll call you back.\nOLIVIA: This is what he needs.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: Sulfide base, neuraminidase blocker. We'd need a chemical supply lab. The closest one's in Wellesley.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: And several hours to synthesize the antidote. I'm sorry, Agent Dunham, we just don't have that long. That glass isn't gonna hold much longer.\nBROYLES: What if we could buy you some time?\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: What are you thinking?\nBROYLES: Fentanyl gas. Pump it inside the building. Knock them out long enough to synthesize a cure. We could have a gas truck here in ten minutes.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: No, even if we could, it wouldn't disperse. The building's ventilation system is down, and I can't risk sending any more of my people inside to turn it on.\nOLIVIA: Then I'll do it.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: That's up to Agent Broyles, not me. You've got fifteen minutes. After that, I can't take the chance.\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir.\n(Olivia races through the bowels of the building with a map, trying to summon an elevator. Peter races from the lobby to the security desk as a woman shouts at the front doors)\nINFECTED WOMAN: Let us out!\n(Peter notices on the security monitor that Olivia has infiltrated the building)\nBROYLES: (on radio) Dunham. The gas truck is here. What's your twenty?\nOLIVIA: (just after she enters) I'm in the elevator, proceeding to the parking garage.\n(screams and shouts continue among the infected. Peter stares at the monitor, then looks around the area trying to figure out a path to intercept Olivia)\nPETER: (attacking Olivia as she walks into the parking garage) Uhh!\nOLIVIA: Ohh! (draws her pistol to defend herself. pleads to her friend) Listen, I'm here to help you.\nPETER: Give me the gun, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Peter, they're gonna shoot you.\nPETER: They're gonna kill us all anyway. (stalking forward. paranoid) The cure is out there. They're lying to us. And you locked me in here.\nOLIVIA: Uhh! (as Peter attacks her) Uhh! (they struggle) Uhh!\nPETER: You betrayed me! (takes a blow to the midsection) Ahh! (her pistol fires into the ceiling)\nOLIVIA: Uhh! (diving for her dropped pistol below a vehicle)\nPETER: (steps on her arm) Hyuh!\nOLIVIA: (in pain) Agh!\nPETER: (after grabbing the pistol) Stay down. (aims at her. dazed, he wanders away)\nBROYLES: (outside on the radio) Dunham. Agent Dunham, can you hear me? (on cell phone) Agent Farnsworth.\nASTRID: (answers phone) Sir.\nBROYLES: Is the ventilation system on yet?\nASTRID: No, sir. It's still off. (holds hand up to vent) Olivia hasn't made it yet.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: We have to move. I gave you fifteen minutes.\nBROYLES: I understand you have operational authority here. But there are people in there that are like family to me. Another ten minutes.\nARNOLD MCFADDEN: I'm sorry.\n(armed teams enter the building)\nASTRID: Here, put this on. (hands mask to Walter)\nWALTER: For what?\nASTRID: Trust me.\n(the gas penetrates the building and an armed team finds Peter unconsious in an elevator)\nWALTER: (adminsters the antidote) You're going to be okay, Peter. Just rest, son. (later, after Peter revives) Son.\nPETER: Thank you. All of you.\nOLIVIA: You feeling better?\nPETER: Olivia... I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: You weren't yourself.\nPETER: It's lucky for me that you were. (Walter walks away distraught)\nASTRID: Walter. (follows him out) Um... Inside... Upstairs... When you said, 'I can't let Peter die again...' what did you mean by that?\nWALTER: Some things are meant to be left alone, Agent Farnsworth."

(hand shake\/kiss)\nMISTER STALLER: Glad you could make it. Good to see you. (hand shake\/hug for Neal)\nLYNN ARRENDT: (old friends arrive with escorts) Hey, take it easy, Nana. There's no hurry.\nNANA STALLER: (fiesty senior matron) You take it easy. This my regular speed.\n(in a private part of the house, bridesmaids attend to the lady of the day as the nuptials draw near)\nELIZA STALLER: Everyone decent in here? (mother of groom knocks on door to enter with video man)\nSHELLEY MILTON: (to future mother-in-law) Come on in, Mrs. Staller.\nELIZA STALLER: Look who I brought, Shelley. (future little brother-in-law carrying video camera) This is how David can see you in your dress before the wedding without the bad luck. Oh... you look stunning.\nSHELLEY MILTON: Thank you so much for... everything.\nELIZA STALLER: I'm so happy you're joining the family. (trying not to tear-up) David is lucky to have you. (girl hug) Okay. I'm crying now. Let's not film this part. (to cameraman) No, no, no. (marches out of the room) Turn it off, turn it off.\n(groomsmen gathered elsewhere in the house gather for adult beverage consumption. the groom seems anxious and may be getting asthmatic)\nDAVID STALLER: Whoa. Whew.\nJOSH STALLER: It'll calm him down. (about the alcohol)\nDAVID STALLER: (wedding day jitters) I didn't think I'd be this nervous.\nJOSH STALLER: Oh... happens to everyone, even me. And, uh, look how I turned out.\n(in the now crowded ceremony and reception area)\nNANA STALLER: Lynn... who is that man? (about the trim, cropped blond hair male standing across the room and surveying the crowd)\nLYNN ARRENDT: I don't know. Must be from Shelley's side.\n(still waiting in the wings)\nJOSH STALLER: Just breathe, man.\nHARRY STALLER: No, where's your inhaler? Where is it? (hands over the inhaler to his brother) It's here. (to the prying cameraman) Harry, just give us a few minutes? Sorry. You're alright. Just a couple minutes. He's okay. He's good. He's okay. (enters the main room with guests and announces) It's okay, it's okay. I can safely say David is not going to run. So just, uh, everybody hang tight. He'll be fine. He's just had a little bit of a reaction...\nNANA STALLER: (drawing on some of her worst memories, she begins to remember the man standing on the other side of the room) It can't be. It can't be. It can't be true.\nLYNN ARRENDT: What's wrong, Nana?\nNANA STALLER: It can't be. It's him. (stands and walks toward the man, pointing at him)\nLYNN ARRENDT: Nana, what are you talking about?\nNANA STALLER: It's -- It's him. (sobbing, she collapses as he stoically looks on) You! You!\nELIZA STALLER: Nana, what's wrong?\nLYNN ARRENDT: Nana, my God, what is it? (as half the guests begin to hack and choke violently)\nELIZA STALLER: Oh, my God. Someone call 911. Josh! Sweetheart! My God! (as the man, Alfred Hoffman, turns and walks from the scene) What is happening?\nBURT MANNING: (greeting her outside the estate amid the official personnel on scene) Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Detective.\nBURT MANNING: Burt Manning. We spoke on the phone.\nOLIVIA: So has anyone touched anything?\nBURT MANNING: M.E.'s inside. We put them in a holding pattern until you got here. It's pretty bad.\nOLIVIA: Do we have a final count on the victims?\nBURT MANNING: Fourteen... so far. (starts to enter the house)\nWALTER: (driving up to the crime scene, distracted, chatty) I quite like weddings. Did I ever tell you about when your mother and I, God rest her soul, got married?\nPETER: No, no, no. I think I missed that one. (jumps curb, hits trash bin) And try to stop driving with both feet. Walter, Walter! (stops)\nWALTER: She was so beautiful, Peter. So beautiful in white. I won't deny I was never happier. I kept my tuxedo in the hope that one day I would have a son who would wear it. You could wear it on your wedding day. (walking from vehicle)\nPETER: Yeah, you know, Walter? Tuxedo styles change.\nWALTER: Oh, nonsense. Purple never goes out of style. And the day may come sooner than you think. Do you think she'll call me Dad?\nPETER: Who?\nWALTER: Agent Dunham.\nPETER: My guess would be no. (approaching Olivia and Manning)\nWALTER: Don't look at me like that. She's just what you need. Someone who can see right through you. Agent Dunham, don't you look lovely today? Doesn't she look lovely, Peter?\nPETER: (flat, appeasing Walter) You look lovely, Agent Dunham.\nWALTER: Doctor Walter Bishop. (shakes Manning's hand) How do you do?\nOLIVIA: Lose a bet? (letting Walter drive the car)\nPETER: It was either that or flying lessons.\nWALTER: (inside, inspecting the dead) Swelling of the vitreous humor.\nPETER: Mm-hmm. (inspecting his corpse)\nWALTER: Petechial hemorrhaging.\nPETER: Yeah, not to mention the blue skin. It's definitely asphyxiation.\nWALTER: The airway's clear.\nPETER: Yeah, same here.\nWALTER: No fluid in the lungs.\nOLIVIA: So all the victims that I've identified so far are on the groom's side. I mean, maybe they came in contact with something before the wedding.\nPETER: Anaphylactic shock. Maybe they're all having an allergic reaction to something they ate or drank.\nWALTER: That would be logical, if they were all exposed at the same time, I suppose.\nOLIVIA: I'll have the detectives reconstruct where they all were. We may find a connection. (looks at a branding tattoo on a victim) She was a Holocaust survivor.\nWALTER: That's dreadful -- to survive a thing like that... (somber) and finish up like this.\nOLIVIA: Walter, do you think this could be a deliberate attack?\nWALTER: I don't know yet. All I know for certain is that these fourteen people suffocated in a room full of air.\nPETER: There's gotta be something they all ate or drank. There, maybe that.\nOLIVIA: God, it's hard to believe that a few hours ago this was actually a happy place.\n(they hear some rustling from a pantry, open the door and find the groom struggling to catch his breath. he collapses to the floor)\nOLIVIA: Oh, my God! We need a medic on the second floor!\nPETER: Alright.\nOLIVIA: He's dropped his inhaler. Grab it.\nWALTER: It's curious. (opening bodybag) All fifteen victims. So they're all blood relatives, then.\nASTRID: (reading from computer monitor) Yes. All of the victims are direct descendants of Eva Staller.\nWALTER: Holocaust survivor.\nASTRID: And anyone not related to her survived, along with one grandchild who I think might be illegitimate.\nWALTER: Therefore, not a blood relative, or I suspect he would have perished too. (scapels open a wedding part corpse) Ostrich, can you come here, dear? What color is this? The blood?\nASTRID: It's blue.\nWALTER: Good. Then I'm not imagining it. Something has bonded with the hemoglobin in the blood, changing its color and robbing the body of oxygen. I believe these people literally suffocated from the inside out. (takes a quick shot from the inhaler)\nASTRID: Walter! No, that might... be what killed him.\nWALTER: No, that kept him alive longer than the others. I suspect it temporarily weakened the toxin. That still leaves the how. How was the toxin delivered?\nOLIVIA: (sitting quietly as Peter walks through the area) Mrs. Staller, I understand that you were in charge of the guest list? Did you notice anyone who shouldn't have been at the wedding? Someone who wasn't invited.\nELIZA STALLER: No. Of course, I don't know the bride's entire family. Although, my mother-in-law, she was very upset with someone before -- a man I had never seen before. I thought she was just having a moment.\nOLIVIA: If we showed you the wedding video, do you think that you would be able to point him out?\nELIZA STALLER: I could try. (to Peter as he inspects the candles) It's jasmine. Shelley picked out the scent. Represents happiness and love. Do you mind giving me a moment?\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nELIZA STALLER: I'll help you with the video. (leaves the room)\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: She just said all the rest of the candles in this place are jasmine, right?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nPETER: Smell that. (she does) This one's cinnamon.\nPETER: And?\nWALTER: Patience, son. Just like when you were a little boy, your mother used to say you had ants in your pants. Put that in the spectrometer. (hands Peter a sealed sample)\nPETER: Okay.\nOLIVIA: (sitting with Astrid at the computer) That's the man that Mrs. Staller identified. Can you make it clearer?\nASTRID: I can try. Oh, that's the best I can do.\nOLIVIA: Alright. Well, upload it to the Joint Law Enforcement Database and maybe we'll get a hit.\nASTRID: Alright.\nPETER: Walter. Come here. Take a look at this.\nWALTER: (joins Peter at his monitor) Oh... that is interesting. (spectral graphs on screen) You were right. This is our toxin. Appears to be a variant of -- what is that? Hydrogen cyanide? The candle would suggest that it was activated by heat, and then dispersed into the air.\nOLIVIA: Well, if it was in the air, how come it only killed some of the guests?\nWALTER: (sincerely) Good question.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: Chemical weapons. Death by asphyxiation. The Nazis. I knew this was familiar.\nOLIVIA: The Nazis?\nWALTER: The Nazis were scientific pioneers. They attempted to advance every branch of science -- Molecular bombs, flying saucers, eternal youth. Before DNA was even discovered, Josef Mengele wanted to create a weapon capable of targeting specific victims, a weapon capable of -- of picking people out in a crowd, just like what happened here. It seems that science may have finally caught up with Nazi ambition.\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Staller was a Holocaust survivor. Do you think that that's...\nWALTER: ...relevant? I don't know, Olivia. Of course, I'm not saying that this is the work of the Nazis. Nor suddenly am I convinced that this was just a murder. A wedding is the perfect laboratory. You have your target group, the Stallers, and you have your control group, everyone else.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying that you think this was a science experiment?\nWALTER: It's a theory. And one that I think I can prove.\nOLIVIA: How?\nWALTER: A scientist always tries to recreate his results. If I'm right, this will happen again.\nCASHIER: (to the mother-daughter team at her counter) One soy latte, one orange juice, two yogurts.\nJORDAN'S MOM: Say thank you, Jordan.\nJORDAN: Thank you.\nALFRED HOFFMAN: (next in line as the ladies move to a table) I'd like a cup of tea, please. And, uh, make sure the water is very hot.\nCASHIER: Sure thing. What kind of tea?\nALFRED HOFFMAN: Oh, I don't know, uh... you pick. (pleasantly smiling) Whichever is your favorite. Oh, and please... make sure the water is very hot.\nJORDAN'S MOM: So do you like her? Mrs. Greenwalt?\nJORDAN: Yeah, she's nice. But she always makes us take a nap after lunch.\nJORDAN'S MOM: Well, maybe you need time to get your energy back.\nJORDAN: I think Mrs. Greenwalt is the one who's sleepy.\nALFRED HOFFMAN: (after sitting at an adjacent table) She's very smart, your daughter.\nJORDAN'S MOM: Yeah, she is.\nALFRED HOFFMAN: Soon you'll be outsmarting the teachers.\nJORDAN'S MOM: Well, we're already there. We're talking about skipping her up a grade.\nALFRED HOFFMAN: Yeah, well, don't be in too much of a hurry. (shakes a small vial of liquid he removed from his pocket) These days are precious. (pours the vial contents into his very hot tea) Soon all you will have... are pictures.\nJORDAN'S MOM: Hmm, that smells good. Is that cinnamon?\nALFRED HOFFMAN: Yeah. Something like that. (as the tea starts to fog and bubble)\nBROYLES: Nine victims. Suffocated just like the wedding in Brookline. (walking past ambulances, emergency responders)\nOLIVIA: Except unlike the Stallers, none of these people were related to each other.\nPETER: You might have to rework that hypothesis, Walter. Maybe this toxin isn't transmitted genetically. (walking past the young girl from inside the diner as she is treated)\nWALTER: It's just a theory, Peter.\nOLIVIA: Any surveillance?\nBROYLES: No cameras inside or on the street. Could be why our suspect chose this place.\nOLIVIA: No candles, I suppose.\nBROYLES: Not a single one.\nPETER: Hey, Walter, is there any other way that this toxin could be delivered?\nWALTER: Any number of ways, I would think. It simply requires a heat source to disperse it into the air. (looking for evidence)\nOLIVIA: (looking at Hoffman's purchase) What about a cup of tea?\nWALTER: Oh, yes, thank you. Hmm? Oh! Oh, yes, yes, that would work. As long as the water was hot enough.\nOLIVIA: Cinnamon.\nBROYLES: I want this cup dusted for prints immediately.\nFORENSICS TECH: Yes, sir. Right away.\nWALTER: (inspecting a female victim) Peter, can you help me? That man there, what color are his eyes?\nPETER: (rolls man over and prys open eyelids) Brown.\nWALTER: I was right after all. It is a targeted toxin. They all have brown eyes. That's the common genetic trait. Check the survivors, but I'm sure I'm right. It's a good thing you weren't here at the time, Agent Broyles, or you would be dead too.\nOLIVIA: So first it was a family. Now it's people with brown eyes. Why is he targeting these people? You said you think it's an experiment. So what-- He's just killing these people to prove that he can?\nWALTER: Perhaps. I'm going to drive us back to the lab. I think I have an idea.\nPETER: Walter... why don't I drive? An idea about what?\nWALTER: I don't know yet.\n(across the street from the diner, Hoffman engages an officer behind the police barricade)\nALFRED HOFFMAN: Excuse me, officer. That man over there. He's named Bischoff.\nPOLICE OFFICER: You mean Doctor Bishop.\nALFRED HOFFMAN: Doctor Bishop.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Did you need something?\nALFRED HOFFMAN: No, I'm just trying to place him. He looks just like his father. (wry smile)\nWALTER: (to Olivia as she returns) Oh! Is that the teacup?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. But, uh, they could only pull a partial print, so no good to run through any databases.\nWALTER: Oh. That's unfortunate. But you are just in time.\nOLIVIA: Just in time for what?\nPETER: Show and tell, apparently.\nWALTER: (claps hands and starts to brief to an image on a large display) This is a molecular model of the toxin. This blue portion, that's the deadly part. This red part, that... that's the targeted group. Um, in the first instance, the Staller family -- Agent Farnsworth? And in this instance, people with brown eyes.\nOLIVIA: Because he can program the toxin to target whatever group he wants.\nWALTER: Any group with \u2013 common physical characteristics or genetic similarities, yes. Um, tall people, short people, fat people, skinny people, black people, brown people, or white people --\nPETER: Hey, Walter. We get it.\nWALTER: Oh... well, anyway, whoever created this was apparently proud of his work. Although I don't know why he should be, I mean -- apart from the genetic targeting, the toxin itself is quite rudimentary. It's a blend of chromium trioxide and hydrogen cyanide.\nPETER: Chromium trioxide? That's highly regulated. If this guy was buying it in any quantity...\nOLIVIA: Astrid, can you --\nASTRID: (as she heads to her workstation) Dig up any companies that deal with chromium trioxide.\nOLIVIA: So, Walter, what were you saying about him being proud of his work?\nWALTER: Ah. See this? (points to a small pigtail feature on the molecular map) That's a carbon chain. It's inert. It's the signature of the creator. Some chemists spell out their initials in molecules. Others create a symbol.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying that we may be able to identify whoever made this?\nWALTER: (takes a closer look) Well, yes, but this could be anybody's. Well, it looks like a stylized \"S\", or a snake.\nPETER: Actually... looks more like a seahorse to me.\nWALTER: Heh, heh, a sea horse. I suppose it could --\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nWALTER: (seriously concerned) Das Seepferdchen. The seahorse. I know who created this toxin.\nPETER: Hey, Walter. Wait, Walter... what's going on? (chase his father into his office)\nWALTER: They called him \"the seahorse\" because he was a great swimmer.\nPETER: Okay, good for him. But who is he?\nWALTER: My father. (looks around his desk) Doctor Robert Bishop.\nPETER: Wait, wait, wait, your father?\nWALTER: I told you these were Nazi experiments. My father was a scientific pioneer at the University of Berlin. (hands large box to Peter)\nPETER: Yes, I know, who came here in 1933, which is long before the Nazis ever took power.\nWALTER: It was 1943. Given the nature of his work, I fudged the date a little.\nPETER: Walter, what are you telling me? That my grandfather was a Nazi? (carries box out)\nWALTER: Technically, yes. Actually... he worked as a spy for the Allies, sabotaging German research and -- and smuggling scientific information to the Americans. I... I knew I recognized the experiment. I must have seen the formula in one of my father's books. (carrying more boxes)\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you saying that you think your father helped develop the formula for this toxin?\nWALTER: It would seem so. (starts searching books from the boxes) But of course, at the time, it was just theoretical. DNA itself was theoretical. That formula has to be here somewhere. These are all of my father's favorite books, first editions of Goethe, Thomas Mann--\nPETER: And you're sure that all those notes were hidden inside of German novels?\nWALTER: Oh, yes. Yes, it was the only way he could smuggle them out of Germany when he left.\nPETER: You're not gonna find those books in there. (boxes)\nWALTER: Oh, no, no. They will be here. These are all the books in my library.\nPETER: No, they won't. (stops the box search) Walter. They're not in there. I sold those books. All of them. About ten years ago. (regretful)\nWALTER: You sold them. Why?\nPETER: I needed money.\nWALTER: Money? They were my books. (growing anger) He left them to me. He knew how dangerous they were.\nPETER: The odds that this case has anything to do with your father's work --\nWALTER: (snapping) The very thing that he was trying to stop, you put back into the world.\nPETER: We don't know that for sure.\nWALTER: Yes, we do! Of course we do. How else would whoever is doing this have gotten hold of the formula? And because I failed to protect it, my father's work is killing people. (very diasappointed)\n(later, in the shadows of Walter's residence, Alfred Hoffman helps himself to an apple... and Walter's sweater)\nBROYLES: (on phone from office) So the killer is using a toxin based on a formula created by Doctor Bishop's father?\nPETER: (on speaker phone from car) Just another skeleton in the Bishop family closet. It's in a book I sold. (exits vehicle for the store)\nOLIVIA: (grabs phone and exits car) So the formula is very complex. We believe that the killer must have found it in one of the books. If we can trace the books, then hopefully we can find him.\nBROYLES: Then do it. Quickly.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (hangs up phone)\nPETER: We'll find those books. (enters store)\nEDWARD MARKHAM: (climbing down from ladder) Come on, Bishop! You sold me those books, like, ten years ago. How am I supposed to know where they are now?\nPETER: Because, Markham, you're exactly the kind of fastidious packrat who keeps a handwritten log of every book he's ever sold.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Such a way with words. (approaches counter) How is it that a beautiful lady like you is stuck with this guy?\nOLIVIA: Uh, it's my job.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Well, I got plenty of books on how to rethink your career. What color is your parachute?... Do what you are...\nPETER: That's thoughtful of you. I really need you to find out who it was who bought those books.\nOLIVIA: Whoever did may be in the midst of a killing spree.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Hmm, sounds serious. Give me a minute, I'll see what I can find.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: You didn't really sell Walter's books for money, did you? Walter's got heaps of valuable stuff. Why did you just sell his books?\nPETER: It was a long time ago. Walter was still in St. Claire, so I wasn't exactly very fond of him at the time. (rueful) Those books were amongst his favorite possessions. And no, to answer your question, I'm not proud of it.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: They were sold last year. (returns with sales info) The name I got is Eric Franko. Lives over in Kendall Square. He struck me as a real weirdo.\nPETER: Coming from you, that's saying something. I owe you one.\n(Hoffman is busy in his lab with a small aluminum canister. Peter and Olivia approach Franko's home and knock on the door)\nOLIVIA: (after flashing a light in the dark front window) Doesn't look like he's here.\nPETER: Well, why don't we just poke around for a bit? (starts to pick lock)\nOLIVIA: (Olivia leads in with pistol drawn to a room full of fascist memorabilia and art work. Franco startles the two as he walks in via a side door) Freeze! FBI! Get down on your knees.\nERIC FRANKO: (drops to knees, hands raised) Don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me. (later, explaining calmly) I'm not a Nazi. I'm an artist. It's about the banality of evil, uh, like the Nuremberg trials showing history's tyrants as these regular schmucks.\nPETER: That is deep. Where are the books you bought from Markham? The German novels.\nERIC FRANKO: The ones with all the creepy stuff inside. The Alice in Wonderland meets the, uh -- the evil Nazi experiment? Well, you're looking at one of them. (points to modern art piece) Uh, so what do those books have to do with the FBI?\nPETER: It's a long story.\nOLIVIA: So none of these have ever been displayed. You're the only person who's ever seen them.\nERIC FRANKO: Sadly, the, uh, contemporary art scene has yet to, um -- fully recognize my particular contributions.\nPETER: I'd like to get these books back -- or what's left of them. I'll pay you whatever you had to pay for them.\nERIC FRANKO: Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, uh... It's gonna take me a while to, uh, dig them all up, uh... but you should also know the collage is for sale. (after getting called on his bluff) Or I could donate it.\nWALTER: Your grandfather was a fan of modern art. (image of fascist dictator) But I don't think he would have appreciated this.\nPETER: I'm sorry, Walter.\nWALTER: Apology not accepted. (sits to study the image) Of course, this means the perpetrator didn't get the formula from the books.\nOLIVIA: No, we don't see how he could have.\nWALTER: Then how on Earth did he recreate the formula using my father's signature, no less?\nASTRID: (returns from side office) No match on the killer's DNA, Walter.\nWALTER: Great. More bad news.\nOLIVIA: Wait, I don't understand. His DNA? Where did you get his DNA?\nASTRID: Doctor Bishop was able to get some from the partial fingerprints \u2013 from the skin cells in the oil. That's pretty amazing.\nWALTER: Not my best work, I'm afraid. The telomere degradation suggested that the man was over a hundred years old, which is fascinating, but not a likely possibility.\nPETER: Hey, Walter, you said this toxin could be programmed to target any genetic trait, right?\nWALTER: Yes.\nPETER: Well, could it be programmed to target more than one? Say, green eyes and brown hair at the same time?\nWALTER: Yes, I suppose it could.\nOLIVIA: What are you thinking?\nPETER: Das Herrenvolk. The master race. The Nazis' ultimate goal. The purification of the German people and the white race.\nOLIVIA: So Nazi science for a Nazi agenda.\nPETER: All of Hitler's dreams in one little toxin.\n(Hoffman walks alone into a dark back alley with a small paper bag in his hand. several trash can fires burn and he is approached by a surly resident when as he squats to empty the paper bag)\nALLEY DWELLER: Hey! What are you doing there?\nALFRED HOFFMAN: I'm conducting a test.. to monitor the dispersion rate of my experiment. Please... you can watch.\n(Hoffman lights the canister he has placed on the ground, and after a few seconds, a large white plume of smoke explodes into the enclosed area. the local man is dead. his dog is unhappy)\nPETER: Walter. What are you doing to those rats?\nWALTER: Killing them. Well, hopefully only the white ones.\nASTRID: I thought you were trying to block the toxin.\nWALTER: I am. But I have to replicate it before I can figure out how to stop it.\nOLIVIA: (enters from a side door) Uh, Astrid couldn't find any companies that purchased chromium trioxide within the past six months. But our EPA contact suggested we search for sodium chromate?\nWALTER: Of course. It's a sister compound. You treat it with sulphuric acid, you get chromium trioxide.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, here are three local buyers. (puts list out for Walter to read) Do you recognize any of them?\nWALTER: Those two -- pharmaceutical companies. This one I've never heard of. (points finger at a Hoffman Biological address)\nPETER: (reading from list) Shipping address is 3340 Eastham Road. Newton, Mass? That's a residential address.\nOLIVIA: (dials out on cell phone) Uh, sir? It's Dunham. Uh, I think we have a location.\n(Hoffman sits in his lab, listening to classical music, and works at preparing a fraudulent identification badge. in the roadway in front of his house, vehicles arrive and a tactical raiding team enters the house with chemical warfare protection masks donned. the science team follow them in. inside, Hoffman hears the commotion from his laboratory in the basement. )\nOLIVIA: Are we clear, Agent Doble?\nAGENT DOBLE: (testing the air and removing his mask) The air is safe.\nRAIDING OFFICER: We're good! All clear!\n(in the basement, Hoffman gathers a box with his weapons, prepares to depart, and heat a beaker on the stove as he departs. Olivia notices a utility room upstairs and discovers a hidden passage to the basement. the team descends to investigate)\nPETER: Makes your lab look downright homey.\nWALTER: (removing vials from a refrigeration display case) Schwarzes haut, braunes haut, grune augen...\nPETER: ...genetic traits. Eye color, hair color, skin tone -- It's the works.\nWALTER: Creating the master race by process of elimination.\nOLIVIA: Guys? I think I found something. (finds unused facial images) Looks like he was making some kind of I.D.\nPETER: (from a nearby counter) Walter, this is your sweater. Walter? (as his father starts choking) Walter! Oh, Walter.\nOLIVIA: (knocks over the heated beaker to stop the attack against Walter) Get him out of here! We need some help downstairs! We need that oxygen, now!\nWALTER: Oxygen...\nPETER: Yeah. Breathe... Just breathe, Walter. Breathe. Breathe.\n(Hoffman waits patiently in line with reporting wait staff at the Performing Arts Center)\nOLIVIA: Walter, how are you feeling?\nWALTER: You got me out just in time. (breathing normally) I'd like my sweater back.\nPETER: We'll work on that, Walter.\nOLIVIA: Walter, why did he go after you?\nWALTER: I don't know. Perhaps he knew my father betrayed the Nazis.\nPETER: Were you able to get that photo to Broyles?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. He's sending it out wide. I also found this. (hands him a plastic badge protector with a faint image on it)\nPETER: I know that logo.\nSECURITY SCREENER: I have to check the contents of the box.\nALFRED HOFFMAN: (holds out badge for inspection) Of course. (stands still for magnetic wand screening)\nSECURITY SCREENER: (after inspecting the cardboard box full of Sterno-style containers) Alright, go ahead.\nOLIVIA: (en route, talking on speaker phone as she drives) It's the annual World Tolerance Conference at the Boston Center for Performing Arts.\nBROYLES: (on phone at office) Do you know who he's planning to target?\nPETER: (speaker phone) No, with that broad a spectrum of genetic markers, the target group could be anybody.\nOLIVIA: We need to evacuate the building.\nBROYLES: I'll call the Head of Security. But there are any number of foreign dignitaries at that conference, so we need to follow protocol. That'll take time.\nPETER: We may not have it.\n(Walter has lingered in Hoffman's makeshift lab with a technician. he finds an old sweater on the floor, picks it up and studies hit. he lifts his mask and tests the air. he notices a device on the shelf and takes it with him, along with the sweater)\nCONFERENCE SPEAKER: (before the assembled guests at the Arts Cneter) There are many difficulties, but we must continue to confront discrimination and uphold the rights of the oppressed. The theme of this year's conference, Individual and Cultural Rights, was not chosen lightly. (dressed in wait staff attire, Hoffman moves between the warming trays, placing his toxin laced cannisters below them as he goes) This organization has a proud tradition of upholding both human rights and cultural diversity. Yet these goals, at times, may appear difficult. Together, we are committed to the promotion of tolerance.\nASTRID: (joins Walter at the lab while he experiments with the things he gathered from Hoffman's lab) Walter? Whenever you're ready, I'll... take you home.\nWALTER: No. I want you to take me to the Performing Arts Center. (pours a light blue liquid into a test tube) I can stop this.\nOLIVIA: (entering the Arts Center) Okay. (briefs the awaiting forces) We're looking for the man, or the mechanism.\nPETER: A candle, a coffee urn...\nOLIVIA: (flashes badge to security) FBI. (to investigators) So... now, remember, he could be anywhere -- On the floor, on the balconies... anywhere. (on tactical radio after they spilt-up) Peter, there's a candle on every table.\nPETER: (on radio) I know. They've been burning for so long. There's no victims. He must be using something more potent.\nASTRID: (to Walter as they arrive at the Arts Center and he heads in the wrong direction) Walter, the conference is this way.\nWALTER: (continues where he was going to go) No, Astrid. We need to take the higher ground. (she follows him upstairs)\nCANTRELL: (over radio) This is Cantrell in the north-west corner. I've got nothing.\nOLIVIA: (over radio) Nothing here, either. Keep circulating.\nCONFERENCE SPEAKER: (continues as law enforcement searches calmly) ... a difference of values, of religions, and of lifestyles. We must take great care, lest our advocacy become its own form of oppression, one that unjustifiably takes sides. (Hoffman smiles as he drifts among the attendees)\nPETER: (on radio) Olivia, I'm in the bar. It could be anything back here. Candles, coffee pots -- It's a disaster. (sees something) Hold on a second.\nOLIVIA: Peter? (hurries to find him)\nPETER: Whoa! (as he intercepts a wait person lighting a warming tray candle) Let's hold off on those for one second. (to Olivia as he removes the candle from under the tray) I think I got it.\nCONFERENCE SPEAKER: (continues aware of security concerns) ... we are united by a common -- (interrupted by loud coughing)\nOLIVIA: (rushing to the sound) Where's the victim? FBI.\nPETER: Everybody, move!\nOLIVIA: Please. Make room! Make room.\nPETER: I said move! Get outta my way! I need a paramedic!\nALFRED HOFFMAN: (laying on the ground, gasping for life) Bischoff! Traitor! (Walter stands defiantly on the balcony above with the device from Hoffman's lab)\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: Yes, Agent Broyles?\nBROYLES: What you did tonight...\nWALTER: ... was to use the killer's DNA to target him and only him using his own toxin. If you plan to press charges, then so be it. But I don't regret what I did.\nBROYLES: (sternly) Good night, Doctor Bishop. (walks off)\nWALTER: Olivia... That man... (Hoffman) he -- he corrupted my father's work.\nOLIVIA: I understand.\nWALTER: No, no, it was more than that. You see, family is very important to me. There's nothing I wouldn't do. (she walks away)\nWALTER: (as Peter returns with a box of stored items) What's this?\nPETER: It's a present. (placing box on desk) Your father's work. I had Franko give me everything that wasn't totally destroyed.\nWALTER: (starts to inspect the contents) Oh, look, Peter. It's your grandfather. (hands him photo)\nPETER: Robert Bischoff?\nWALTER: That was his name. He changed it when he came over here. Your mother always said that you shared his noble brow. It's a pity you never got to know him. You two would have gotten along very well, I think.\nPETER: (smiles. starts to leave room) You know, there is still one thing that doesn't make any sense. If the formula for the toxin didn't come from your father's notes, how did this guy get it?\nWALTER: Hmm. Perhaps there are some mysteries that are destined to remain unsolved. (earnestly) Thank you for bringing these back. (an image of young Walter hangs on the wall with an older scientist standing in the background)"

Thought you were getting out of here.\nTED PRATCHET: Afraid not. It's gonna be a late one.\nPAULINE HESS: Wait a second. Is that -- is that real coffee? Where did you get that?\nTED PRATCHET: I don't know. I have my sources.\nPAULINE HESS: Aha.\nTED PRATCHET: I've got a cousin in Hawaii. She has a secret stash. She sends me stuff every - (building shakes) - this is getting nuts. What is that, six since yesterday?\nPAULINE HESS: Yeah, well, I'm from California, so I'm used to it, you know?\nTED PRATCHET: But this is New York. Don't you think it's strange?\nPAULINE HESS: Hmm.\nTED PRATCHET: What are they saying on the news?\nPAULINE HESS: That they're just these little quakes, you know? Microquakes. Probably just some byproduct of global warming. Well, see you tomorrow. Oh, and if you, uh, have any extra coffee... call me.\nTED PRATCHET: Good night, Pauline.\nPAULINE HESS: Night.\n(the building shakes harder, Ted covers his prized real coffee, car alarms sound outside, dust and debris fall from the ceiling. his coffee spills onto a set of engineering plans to rebuild the New Pentagon Annex IV. lights shatter. pipes erupt. all of the tremors stop. Ted recovers... pierced in the shoulder by a metal beam and pinned to the floor. Ted is not in his universe anymore - he has collided with this universes' Ted. four arms... four legs... the works)\n(2:03 AM and Peter wanders downstairs with the phone to his ear)\nPETER: You've got to be kidding me.\nOLIVIA: Congratulations, Mister Bishop. (on the phone, putting on her work shoes at her home) You've just won an all-expense-paid trip to New York City.\nPETER: I thought I told your people to take me off your contestant list. (pouring coffee in kitchen)\nOLIVIA: Not according to our records. (putting on jacket) It says here that you're a fan of fine dining and excitement.\nPETER: Do you have a supervisor? Anybody there I could complain to? This has to stop.\nOLIVIA: Did I mention there's excitement?\nPETER: (enter his fathers' sleeping area) Walter, wake up. We just won an all-expense-paid trip to New York City.\nWALTER: That's fantastic. (delighted at the good news) I've never won anything before.\nWALTER: (sitting in the back of the vehicle as they approach) An earthquake in Manhattan. It's possible, but highly unlikely. Perhaps a small comet.\nOLIVIA: Any witnesses?\nBROYLES: (driving the vehicle) Witnesses outside felt the ground shake, but no one saw what happened.\nOLIVIA: (after they park among the emergency vehicles and exit the car) What about the people inside?\nBROYLES: Emergency Services secured this entrance into the building, scouring the place for survivors.\nPETER: How many did they find?\nBROYLES: Zero.\nOLIVIA: (staring up at the exterior of the five-story brick building) It looks...\nWALTER: ...rearranged. Extraordinary.\nOLIVIA: (after entering and searching with flashlights, two faces fused together) Oh, my God.\nBROYLES: I don't suppose you have any idea what could have caused this?\nWALTER: Quantum tectonic event would be my guess. Until now, this phenomenon has just been theoretical.\nBROYLES: A quantum tectonic event?\nWALTER: Well, yes. Imagine a sudden momentary disturbance at a subatomic level. The energy disperses the atoms, literally tearing the very fabric of reality itself.\nPETER: Meaning that all the atoms come apart, but when they reassemble, they come together all wrong.\nOLIVIA: So what are the odds of something like this occurring naturally?\nWALTER: Oh, it's possible. But if so, God has a far more disturbed sense of humor then even I could have imagined.\nFIREFIGHTER: We've got a survivor.\nPARAMEDIC #1: Third floor! Let's move!\n(all personnel race up the stairwell, passing mangled corpses as they go)\nPARAMEDIC #1: He says his name is Ted Prachet.\nTED PRATCHET: Help, please.\nPARAMEDIC #1: (to the man impaled by a metal beam) Hold still, sir. It's important you try not to move, okay?\nTED PRATCHET: Please help.\nPARAMEDIC #1: I don't know if we can cut him loose from that beam. He might not survive.\nTED PRATCHET: Call my wife. Someone please call my wife. I just want to hear her voice.\nBROYLES: Mister Pratchet, I'm Special Agent Broyles with the FBI. This is Agent Dunham. We're going to do everything we can to find your wife and get you out of here safely. (to Olivia) I'll call this in.\nOLIVIA: Mister Pratchet, it would help us a lot if you could describe what happened here.\nTED PRATCHET: Tremors. Just like the other ones. Then a really big one that just kept getting worse. (struggling) I'm so thirsty.\nPARAMEDIC #2: He can't drink anything. Maybe some ice, but no liquids.\nPETER: I'm on it. (as Walter examines the damaged artwork on the wall)\nOLIVIA: Mister Pratchet, did anything unusual happen before the disaster? Maybe someone in the building who shouldn't have been here.\nTED PRATCHET: No. Just the same things everyone saw. Yesterday, the dogs all started howling. Then all those little tremors. The microquakes.\nPETER: Did you hear about any tremors in New York? (as Walter examines a blueprint for the New Pentagon Annex)\nBROYLES: (returning to Olivia) Ted Pratchet doesn't have a wife, and it appears he never did.\nOLIVIA: Makes sense. Trauma from his injuries. He must be delirious.\nWALTER: I don't think so. (to Paramedic) Excuse me, Miss. Thank you. Thank you. (to Prachet) Sir... what year is it?\nTED PRATCHET: Two thousand ten.\nWALTER: Good. Good.\nOLIVIA: (warning) Walter...\nWALTER: And who is The President?\nTED PRATCHET: President Obama.\nWALTER: Mm-hmm. Good. Good. Good, good. Now, I'm sorry to do this --\nPETER: (intervening) Walter. Hey, Walter. What's the point of this?\nWALTER: (cautioning) Peter. (to Pratchet) I'm sorry about this, but it is very important. On September the eleventh, when the terrorists struck, which buildings did they attack?\nTED PRATCHET: The Pentagon.\nWALTER: Uh-huh. And...\nTED PRATCHET: (dying words) The White House.\nWALTER: I think I know what happened here.\nOLIVIA: (moving lump under Pratchet's shirt) Walter, what is that?\n(opens the shirt and sees the face of Ted Pratchet from Manhattan as it gasps for air and dies)\nWALTER: (after closing two sets of eyelids) My theory was wrong. This wasn't a quantum event at all. We're standing in two buildings. One of which comes from the alternate universe.\nWALTER: (standing outside the damaged structure) I've asked them to send Mister Pratchet's bodies back to the lab. Maybe they'll provide some insight into how this thing happened.\nOLIVIA: I already know how this happened.\nWALTER: Oh?\nOLIVIA: Two universes colliding. This is what William Bell warned me about. He said that Newton would try to open a doorway from our universe to the other side and that when it happened this would be the consequence.\nPETER: Two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time.\nOLIVIA: This was Newton. I'm sure of it. He was here.\nASTRID: Walter, I don't think I can do this. I've seen some pretty disturbing things in my time working with you, and I think I've handled them pretty well, but this... I can't do.\nWALTER: Awful, isn't it? Those boxes over there have evidence from the building. You can go through them.\nASTRID: Thank you. Alright, so what am I looking for?\nWALTER: Anything that looks like it doesn't belong.\nASTRID: Okay. I think this qualifies. Richard Nixon on a silver dollar.\nWALTER: That's disturbing.\nASTRID: So when you separate them, Walter, how are you going to tell them apart?\nWALTER: Mister Pratchet from over there was married. He was wearing a wedding ring.\nASTRID: So as far as his wife will ever know, he just disappeared? That is so sad.\nWALTER: Yes, it is.\nASTRID: Wow. Look at this. It's a double-decker car. Does this mean that they drive these over there?\nWALTER: I suppose so.\nASTRID: What?\nWALTER: I know what Newton did. And I'm afraid I've just remembered what's going to happen next.\nOLIVIA: Newton. He was there. This was taken two hours before the incident. He and his men disguised themselves as a construction crew.\nBROYLES: So how do we find him?\nOLIVIA: We're running down VIN numbers. We're looking into equipment rental, but I would like to take a crew back to New York.\nPETER: It's Walter. Hey.\nWALTER: Peter, I need you back at the lab. Agent Dunham as well.\nPETER: Walter, we're right in the middle of something.\nWALTER: Don't argue with me, son. Get back here now, both of you.\nPETER: That is what's so important?\nWALTER: This happened almost twenty-five years ago right here on campus.\nPETER: I know. I've heard this story before. M.I.T. students fused a car to the statue of John Harvard. It was a prank. They had to cut the car away. They never figured out how they did it.\nOLIVIA: This wasn't M.I.T. students, was it? This was one of your experiments?\nWALTER: When Belly and I first tried to generate a stable door between universes, our first test subject was a car -- Belly's old Monte Carlo -- and it did not go well.\nPETER: First times are always sloppy.\nWALTER: It wasn't our first time. Eleven minutes after we successfully made the car disappear, this car appeared from another reality.\nPETER: How do you know that wasn't just pulled from down the block?\nWALTER: It was in 1986. The car had a CD player. It wasn't an option at the time.\nOLIVIA: Okay, assuming what you're saying is true, why? I mean, how did the car appear?\nWALTER: The universe seeks balance. We sent a car over there, so a car of equal mass came back. Now, a building from the other side appeared here. The laws of physics demand both sides of the equation balance. I calculate that a building from this side will be pulled over there, inhabitants and all... within the next... just under 35 hours.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so how do we stop it?\nWALTER: That's the thing, Agent Dunham. We can't.\nOLIVIA: Okay, then we need to evacuate the building. So how do we identify which building it's going to be?\nWALTER: Well, the one thing that Belly and I learned from our experience is that when objects from the other universe cross to our side, they have an energy. Someone once described it as a glimmer. I believe that in the moments before the event when the fabric of the two universes is rubbing together, that the building on this side will begin to take on that glimmer.\nPETER: So then we'd be able to see it?\nWALTER: Well, unfortunately, no. It's not visible to the human eye.\nPETER: Then how the hell are we going to find it, Walter?\nWALTER: We can't, Peter! But you can, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: How can I see it?\nWALTER: Because you saw it once before.\nOLIVIA: Walter, when did I see things from the other side?\nWALTER: Twenty-six years ago when you were a little girl. The Cortexiphan Trials. As I've said, the drug worked on perception. Of the thirty children that William Bell and I experimented on, you were the first with the ability to identify things from the other side. We gave you the ability.\nPETER: Walter, you were conducting illegal drug trials on children. Don't make that sound like charity work.\nOLIVIA: Was it me who described it as a glimmer? Well, I can't see it anymore.\nWALTER: Because I believe you stopped wanting to. When you did, there were consequences, but I was able to elicit the ability once. I believe I may be able to do it again.\nPETER: Don't be ridiculous. You're not experimenting on Olivia, and besides...\nOLIVIA: ...Okay, I'll do it.\nPETER: Olivia!\nOLIVIA: We don't have time, so just tell me what it is I need to do.\nWALTER: First, I need a plane. I need to go to Jacksonville to the lab where Belly and I first conducted the Cortexiphan Trials. It's a daycare center you attended as a child. I should be able to recreate the procedure there.\nPETER: Walter, Jacksonville's a thousand miles away.\nWALTER: It's a thousand sixteen to be exact, not counting the trip to the airport.\nPETER: Look, Walter, I'm sure whatever you need, we can get it here.\nWALTER: What I need is in Jacksonville! Jacksonville is where the process worked. If I am able to do it again, it has to be there.\nBROYLES: A building in Manhattan is just going to disappear?\nOLIVIA: Yes, that's what Walter believes.\nBROYLES: What makes him think whatever he needs to trigger this ability of yours is still inside the facility in Jacksonville?\nOLIVIA: When William Bell founded Massive Dynamic, he bought the building and the entire military base it was sitting on from the government. He shut it down and closed it off. I believe that everything is still inside.\nBROYLES: And you're sure you want to do this? Submit yourself to Doctor Bishop's experiments?\nOLIVIA: I don't see another choice.\nBROYLES: Then how can I help?\nOLIVIA: The events that Ted Pratchet said led up to the incident -- the dogs howling, the small earthquakes -- Walter thinks that they will likely occur again and that we can use them to infer when it's about to happen.\nBROYLES: I'll contact Nina Sharp, ask to her to have Massive Dynamic enlist their Geologic Division to track any seismic activity.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nBROYLES: And Dunham... stay in touch.\nOLIVIA: I will.\nWALTER: Five... twenty... ten... I always use the same combination, though I can't remember the significance. Come. Do you see anything?\nOLIVIA: Like what?\nWALTER: Sixteen items in this room... are from the other side. Perhaps if you look a little closer. Come. Go ahead.\nOLIVIA: Nothing.\nWALTER: Well... we should get started. I was hoping to avoid this.\nOLIVIA: I have a freakishly good memory. I remember everything. But not this. There's just nothing that's familiar.\nPETER: Maybe that's a good thing.\nWALTER: You just about ready? You may want to change into something more comfortable. Perception is largely an emotional response. How we feel... affects the way we see the world. And so Belly and I reasoned that extreme emotions would stimulate this perception, that acute feelings of fear and love or anger would heighten the awareness. Open the mind, as it were. The drugs help, of course.\nOLIVIA: Is that Cortexiphan?\nWALTER: Start the I.V. drip, please, and lift up.\nPETER: You sure you want to do this?\nWALTER: Oh, wait! Right arm. No, left arm, left arm. When you're under, the drugs will generate an obstacle. I can't tell you what it will be. It will be uniquely yours. Do you understand?\nOLIVIA: I think so.\nWALTER: It will make more sense when you're under. The point is this. That facing that obstacle will elevate your emotional state. Much as running on a treadmill will elevate your heartbeat. And then when I've got you to the proper level, well, then I'll pull you out, okay?\nOLIVIA: I am singing in the rain.\nWALTER: Oh. The drugs are working fast. Perhaps it was the right arm.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: She'll be fine, Peter. Peter... would you turn that around? Thank you. Olivia, I want you to open your eyes. Olivia, can you hear me? If you can hear me, open your eyes. Where are you?\nOLIVIA: I'm in a forest. I can see very tall trees.\nWALTER: That's good. That's good, Olivia. Theta rhythms are normal. Stable neocortex active. It's working.\nOLIVIA: There's someone else here.\nPETER: Is she alright?\nWALTER: No, but she's not supposed to be. In my bag, Peter.\nPETER: Yeah?\nWALTER: The pretzels.\nPETER: Pretzels.\nOLIVIA: Hey. It's alright.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Please. I don't want to do this anymore.\nOLIVIA: You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do. You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do. Wait! Hey!\nPETER: Walter?\nWALTER: Shh. She's close.\nOLIVIA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! It's okay. Shh. Shh. Shh.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Please. Make them stop. Please make them stop it.\nOLIVIA: It's okay. I'm here now. Nothing can hurt you. It's okay. That's better. What's your name?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Olive.\nPOSSESSED YOUNG OLIVIA: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Ah!\nWALTER: Good news. It worked.\nOLIVIA: What the hell is wrong with you? You did this to little children?\nWALTER: We should get to work.\nWALTER: Anything?\nOLIVIA: Nothing. Now what? Should we find some more kids to scare?\nWALTER: I have no idea.\nNINA: Phillip, it's me.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: It started.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWILLIAM BELL: Is she okay?\nWOMAN: She's fine.\nWILLIAM BELL: Hell, do we know what triggered it?\nWALTER: (on video) Obviously she was upset, William. It's okay. It's alright, Olive.\nOLIVIA: That's me. What happened?\nWALTER: This was the first time you saw the other side. You were frightened. Started a fire with your mind. It should have worked. This is the very sort of thing that William and I were preparing for.\nOLIVIA: You abused us, Walter -- me and those other children.\nWALTER: No, we -- we were trying to help you. We were trying to make you more than you were.\nOLIVIA: Is that what you were doing? Or were you searching for answers to questions that you shouldn't have been asking in the first place?\nWALTER: I was a different man then.\nOLIVIA: I was a defenseless child.\nWALTER: Yes, you were. Yes, you were. Olivia, I think I'm starting to understand why the process didn't work. You are different. You're not that frightened child anymore. I thought all we needed was a heightened emotional response from you, but I was wrong. We needed a specific one. Fear. And you're not capable of that anymore. Well, not like she was. What we did to you -- you found a way to protect yourself. You channeled your fear into anger, which is why you are so good at your job. But if you want to save those people, you have to find your way back to that scared little girl.\nOLIVIA: And how do we do that?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nPETER: Hey. Is this a part of Walter's test? Are you alright?\nOLIVIA: No. I'm not afraid of anything anymore.\nNINA: Let me know if anything changes. Four tremors in the last two hours. Most recent measured two-point-six.\nBROYLES: They're increasing in frequency.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry.\nBROYLES: You didn't send that building over here.\nPETER: So what's Plan 'B'?\nBROYLES: We're compiling data. Trying to predict where the next incident will take place. Satellite images, seismic activity, weather patterns.\nPETER: You need a fresh set of eyes?\nNINA: Yes. I'll take you to the lab.\nBROYLES: We've still got time.\nBRANDON: We've been plotting the epicenter of each microquake looking for some sort of pattern.\nPETER: Can you regress any of the data points?\nWALTER: It's a waste of time. Useless attempt to impose order on random, meaningless data. Tried the same thing twenty-five years ago when the car came over, and tried to tell them why. Why there? Why'd it land in the middle of the Quad? The answer is there was no answer.\nPETER: Except mass. The two cars. You said they were the same mass.\nBRANDON: Okay, you two have something going on? Do you want to fill me in?\nPETER: Walter seems to think that the two universes have to be in balance. So a building from over there travels over here. That means a building over here of exactly the same mass has to travel back.\nBRANDON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Raiders Of The Lost Ark. The bag of sand and the idol.\nPETER: Not the metaphor I would have used, but, yes, exactly.\nWALTER: Do you have a pencil?\nBRANDON: I have a pen.\nWALTER: I need satellite data and 3-D imagery to calculate the cubic feet. I'll also need a comprehensive list of all building materials used during construction.\nBRANDON: For every freestanding structure in New York City?\nWALTER: Oh, I think we can rule out the Empire State Building.\nOLIVIA: Hey, Peter. Anything?\nPETER: Good news. We have a plan.\nBRANDON: Okay, he can eliminate the three buildings in Tribeca, because they're way too big.\nPETER: Are they lofts?\nBRANDON: Yeah, why?\nPETER: Lofts have no interior walls. Even though one of the buildings might be bigger, they could be the same mass.\nBRANDON: Yep.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, the guys downstairs on the supercomputer are crunching numbers on the first six buildings, but it's gonna take some time. What else can I do to help?\nWALTER: It's time. It could happen any moment now. Olivia...\nOLIVIA: ...how many buildings are we down to?\nBROYLES: A hundred and forty-seven buildings spread out all over Manhattan. Three hospitals, a cancer treatment center, a nursing home.\nOLIVIA: The NYPD and the Fire Ddepartment have a standing evacuation protocol. With our help, they could clear most of those buildings...\nBROYLES: ...the evacuation itself would kill a lot of these people. Not to mention cause a city-wide panic that might kill thousands more. The largest building on this list has, what, five hundred people?\nOLIVIA: So you think we should just let the building disappear? Let those people disappear?\nBROYLES: There are times when the only choices you have left are bad ones.\nPETER: Hey, I figured if I could shut down all the non-essential functions, I can make these things run faster.\nOLIVIA: It's too late. I failed. I failed and I'm supposed to be the one who can stop things like this.\nPETER: Olivia. You... I've never met anyone who can do the things that you do.\nOLIVIA: Peter. I'm scared.\nPETER: Don't be. What?\nOLIVIA: Peter, I'm scared.\nOLIVIA: (alone. driving quickly) ...it was in the West Village, near the Hudson, I think. I couldn't see exactly where.\nPETER: Was it near the piers?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, a couple of blocks from the river.\nBROYLES: Were there any landmarks? Other buildings nearby there?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, that new tower, the one near the elevated tracks.\nBROYLES: The High Line.\nWALTER: Still too many potential candidates.\nPETER: Whoa! whoa! Hey, Olivia, we need you to narrow it down --\nOLIVIA: I'm trying. Okay, I see it. It's on Washington.\nWALTER: Peter, there was a hotel on Washington.\nBROYLES: What do we have on Washington?\nPETER: No, he's right. Brayson Place Hotel. 13th and Washington, number's right there.\nBROYLES: Call Chief Solomon at the NYPD. Call the Fire Department, and -- hello, yes. This is Special Agent Phillip Broyles with the FBI. You need to evacuate everyone from the building immediately.\nOLIVIA: Is everybody out?\nHOTEL MANAGER: I think so.\nOLIVIA: I guess it's safe to say that you've got the rest of the night off work.\nTV ANNOUNCER: ...not a single casualty when hundreds miraculously escaped what Federal authorities an unscheduled controlled demolition at the Brayson Place Hotel...\nOLIVIA: The conspiracy nuts are gonna have a field day.\nBROYLES: You'd be surprised what you can make the General Public believe. You saved a lot of people.\nOLIVIA: We all did.\nBROYLES: Dunham... this ability you've demonstrated... what finally activated it?\nOLIVIA: I think it was just time.\nPETER: Yeah, Monopoly is great. He loves the colored money. Okay. Thanks again. I'll see you soon. Hey, Walter, that was Astrid. She's gonna come over and play some games with you.\nWALTER: Oh... good. I hope she likes Monopoly. Where are you going?\nPETER: Me? I'm going out for drinks.\nWALTER: Oh, who are you drinking with?\nPETER: Olivia.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham? A date?\nPETER: No, just drinks. Apparently, that's what normal people do. They go out for drinks. If you need to reach me, I'll leave you the number of the restaurant right here, okay?\nWALTER: She's here, Peter.\nPETER: I know, I heard it too.\nWALTER: Shall I get the door?\nPETER: Absolutely not. In fact, it would be my preference if you could be someplace else all together.\nWALTER: Oh... where?\nPETER: Chicago?\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hi.\nPETER: Come on in. I know a great place. It's just a couple blocks away. I thought we'd walk.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham.\nPETER: I'll go get my coat.\nWALTER: Olivia. Please don't tell him."

What you must understand is that, as scientists, we must embrace every possibility. No limitations. No boundaries. There is no reason for them. Gentlemen... I would like you to take a look at this. (hands over for inspection a small cellular phone inconsistent with 1985 technology) It's a mobile telephone. It can be made much smaller, I assure you.\nGENERAL HAMES: Does this work?\nWALTER: Not here, not yet. This phone is digital, not analog. It'll take us thirty years to get up to speed. I didn't invent it. I wish I had.\nGENERAL HAMES: Doctor Bishop, we were under the impression Doctor Bell would be here this evening.\nWALTER: I'm afraid that's not possible. Doctor Bell is in Europe. But I am here, so I can answer any questions you may have.\nGENERAL TONKS: Doctor Bishop. Is this Russian technology?\nWALTER: It is not. It is quite American, but... it is technology from another universe. An alternate universe just like ours... but more advanced in some areas.\nGENERAL TONKS: Are you suggesting you somehow visited this alternate universe and acquired this advanced technology?\nWALTER: No. It is theoretically impossible to go there.\nGENERAL TONKS: Then how did you come to possess this?\nWALTER: I copied it. (continues his briefing on the roof of the tall building. The four men join Walter's aide for a demonstration) For the last several years, William and I have been conducting various experiments regarding this other universe. So based on our findings, we developed a window of sorts, a way of looking into this neighboring world. And that is why we are asking for funding. This is my colleague, Doctor Carla Warren.\nCARLA WARREN: (as she prepares a clear, large flat screen device on a pedestal) Hello, sirs.\nWALTER: (referring to the device) This window works by capturing errant photons from the universe beside ours. The window essentially stretches the membrane between our worlds and allows us... to see their image from our side.\nGENERAL HAMES: You're gonna make some sort of alternate Manhattan appear?\nWALTER: It's already there, General Hames. Doctor Warren. At all times, right in front of our eyes. We just can't see it. (Carla activates the device and rotates it) I'm sure you know that the original purpose for the so-called observation deck of the Empire State Building was to be a docking station... for Zeppelins, of course. (a large airship approaches the building in the image of the alternate universe) Gentlemen, you are looking through a window... into another world.\nOLIVIA: (answers the late evening doorbell holding an adult beverage) Walter, what are you doing here?\nWALTER: You left me no choice. You wouldn't answer your telephone, return my messages. I tried to communicate.\nOLIVIA: I need time, okay? I don't even know... how to begin to work this out.\nWALTER: I think I do. Please, Olivia, I need to explain. And if you wouldn't mind, I could use a sip of something, myself. (inside, as Olivia pours his drink) Have you told Agent Broyles?\nOLIVIA: No. But to be honest, that doesn't mean that I won't.\nWALTER: I always knew that one day I'd have to pay the price for my deception.\nOLIVIA: Well, we're not really sure what the cost is yet, are we?\nWALTER: No. I suppose not. I invented this after William and I learned that we had doubles on the other side. Or maybe it was before. I can't remember. It's a window to the other universe. I was a different man then. I was going to change the world. But you see, after Peter became sick, none of that seemed to matter anymore. The illness was genetic. Savage. Wasting. I tried everything. There was simply no hope. At least... not on this side. But over there... they're more technologically advanced. If the alternate Peter was also sick over there, then wouldn't his father be equally motivated to find a cure? He was. God help me... He was.\nCARLA WARREN: (joins Walter as he views the alternate universe lab through the device) Any progress?\nWALTER: He's synthesizing a new compound now. He's using cobalt and magnesium.\nCARLA WARREN: Any idea yet how he's selecting the filtering compounds?\nWALTER: Random, I think. Chance, fate, luck of the draw. I've given him a name, Carla.\nCARLA WARREN: Hmm?\nWALTER: Walternate. (watches the experiment that is unfolding on the other side of the device) This is it. This should be the reaction. (as it fails) No cure. (makes a notation on his marker board then thinks) Perhaps with a higher iodine purification. (walks to his office to answer the phone) Walter Bishop.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter?\nWALTER: Elizabeth. (concerned) Is he...?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: ...yeah, no, he's -- he's fine. He's -- he's alright right now. But, um...\nWALTER: What?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I think you should come home now, Walter. I think it's time you came home.\nWALTER: Okay. Okay.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (sitting. distraught. to Walter after he enters the house) He looks worse. Keeps asking for you. It's not like before.\nWALTER: What is it like?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: It's different. He keeps saying he wants to talk to you. He says he's worried he won't be able to. (as Walter plays quiet music on the phonograph) I just can't bear it when you're not here.\nWALTER: You know what I'm doing. You know where I am twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yes.\nWALTER: I won't give up, Elizabeth. I can do this. I need you not to doubt me. (after joining Peter as the boy rests in bed) You're supposed to be getting some rest, my son.\nPETER: Dad?\nWALTER: Mm?\nPETER: I've almost got it. (tries to master a manual dexterity trick with his favorite coin)\nWALTER: Ooh. Let me show you. Now... Slowly... Watch... one finger at a time. (demonstrates the trick perfectly) You show me. (hands the coin back. chuckles when Peter is successful) Very good.\nPETER: I want you to have it, my lucky silver dollar, if I die.\nWALTER: Peter...\nPETER: It's okay. I'm not scared. (in quiet pain)\nWALTER: Nothing's going to happen to you. I promise. You're going to be just fine. Okay? Now get some rest.\nPETER: Okay. Will you wake me for dinner? I don't wanna miss it.\nWALTER: You're not gonna miss anything. (hugs Peter. then realizes Peter has just died in his arms)\nNINA: (after standing graveside with the Bishop's and Doctor Warren) You know how much William wanted to be here. But with the meetings in Berlin... I don't need to tell you how important they are for both of you. He wanted me to make sure that you know how terrible he feels.\nWALTER: Yes. I understand. I'm glad you came.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: We didn't give him a good life. We didn't. He practically never got out of the house.\nWALTER: He was always too sick.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: He didn't go to a proper school. He didn't have any proper friends. He...He had no family but us. We kept him so well, we never let anyone else get to know him.\nWALTER: (sitting quietly) We did the best we could. We dealt with what we were given. He knew he was loved. Didn't he? (inhales)\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (later that evening she is stirred from bed) Walter, what's wrong? You're cold. Have you been outside?\nWALTER: Come with me. (leads her to Peter's room)\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter, what is this? (whispering) How's this possible? (as she sees alternate universe Peter in the imaging device) How are you doing this?\nWALTER: What I've been working on, Elizabeth, it's a window to another universe. Like ours, but different.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (sighs) Please. Please turn it back on again. Please turn it on. I want to see him again!\nWALTER: Elizabeth, I am telling you this because I want you to know that somewhere Peter will grow up, somewhere he will lead a proper life, somewhere he will be happy, but just not here. And we must take comfort in this. And we must begin to move on.\nWALTER: (having a drink and watching his alternate self work on the other side of the device) The compounds you're using for the cure... Not random at all. You are very... very smart. (alternate Walter turns to greet The Observer as he enters the lab) Yes! You did it! By God, you did it! (the cure succeeds, unnoticed, then fails, during the distraction) No. No, no, y-- You had it, the cure. All you have to do is stabilize the compound, and you can save him. You can save him. (distraught, Walter destroys the viewing device)\nDECEMBER: (as he exits a late afternoon matinee of a 1985 sci-fi movie in the alternate universe) Their theories are fascinating.\nAUGUST: They are not theories. They are entertainment.\nTHE OBSERVER: (waiting curside for the duo) I have made... a mistake.\nDECEMBER: So I've heard. What were you doing in the lab?\nTHE OBSERVER: Doctor Bishop was on the verge of developing a cure for the boy. It was an important moment. He discovered me. There was no other way to witness the moment.\nAUGUST: You have changed the future. You have created a new set of probabilities.\nTHE OBSERVER: But you must agree the moment was significant.\nAUGUST: The boy is significant.\nDECEMBER: You need to take action to restore balance.\nTHE OBSERVER: How?\nAUGUST: (thinking ahead) You will have an opportunity to fix this. (walks off with his movie companion)\nCARLA WARREN: (walking in from outside) Walter?\nWALTER: Doctor Warren.\nCARLA WARREN: Have you been here all night?\nWALTER: (looks up from his efforts) I've been working.\nCARLA WARREN: Working on what?\nWALTER: This.\nCARLA WARREN: What is this?\nWALTER: Walternate found a cure. He found a cure for Peter... and -- and it works, Carla. It's not too late. I can save him.\nCARLA WARREN: Walter, Peter is dead.\nWALTER: I know. Of course I know that! I'm not talking about my Peter. I'm talking about the other Peter, the one on the other side. He missed it. The other Walter. He--he missed it and, you know... It was right there in front of him, and -- and he didn't see it. He was distracted by the man.\nCARLA WARREN: What man?\nWALTER: The man in the lab. He was distracted. And -- and when he returned, the positive result had failed, and so he moved on.\nCARLA WARREN: Maybe he'll realize what he missed, and he'll go back.\nWALTER: Carla, he is just... like... me. I wouldn't look back, and neither will he. He didn't see the compound... (whispers) but I did. And I've reproduced it. It just needed... minor modification. And without this, Peter will die. He'll die all over again. Which is why I have to go over there.\nCARLA WARREN: What?\nWALTER: The Casimir Effect should produce a thinner, more porous region of space-time. I only need to affect the area for long enough to cross over to the other side with a vial of the cure. And -- and then, of course, recreate the effect to cross back again.\nCARLA WARREN: Walter, you're trying to create a wormhole into another universe?\nWALTER: Yes! I think I just said that. Where's my map? When I looked into his room on the other side, I saw that his mother had already packed his suitcase for our lake house, just like we do every year at this time. That's where we need to find a location to set up.\nCARLA WARREN: Walter, I'm sorry, but you can't.\nWALTER: Yes. Yes, I think I can.\nCARLA WARREN: No, Walter, I mean you can't. Shattering the wall between universes would rupture the fundamental constants of nature.\nWALTER: It's a theory. We don't know that to be true.\nCARLA WARREN: It's a good theory. It is why we have been lying to the military, telling them it's impossible. Walter, there has to be a line somewhere. There has to be a line we can't cross.\nWALTER: I always considered you as a scientist, Doctor Warren... despite your personal needs for religious claptrap. I see I was wrong.\nCARLA WARREN: \"I am become death, Destroyer of Worlds.\"\nWALTER: Don't you quote Oppenheimer to me.\nCARLA WARREN: Knowledge cannot be pursued without morality.\nWALTER: You sound like a pious sanctimonious Southern Preacher!\nCARLA WARREN: I may go to church every Sunday, Walter, but I also have three degrees in theoretical physics, and I am telling you you cannot do this. We both know the amount of energy required to create a portal will forever ruin both universes. For the sake of one life, you will destroy the world. Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things are God's.\nWALTER: My son is dying, Doctor Warren. I will not allow that to happen again. There's only room for one God in this lab, and it's not yours. (points to Lake Reiden on the map) The lake. It's perfect. The water will absorb the excess energy. And I won't be needing your assistance any further today, Doctor Warren.\nCARLA WARREN: Walter\nWALTER: -- that will be all!\nNINA: Walter's always been like that. He often goes off on flights of fancy. But even if he was serious, the design itself is decades beyond anything we could imagine.\nCARLA WARREN: No. You don't understand. He already has the design. He's building it.\nNINA: Oh. (dials out on her bulky 1985 cellular phone) Yes. Doctor Bell's room, please.\nWALTER: (to himself, as he stops hauling his gear and surveys the frozen surface of the lake) Here. It will do. (he proceeds to assemble his equipment and start a portable generator. he begins to initiate the portal, checks the vial containing the cure for Peter, then notices he has company on the frozen lake) See you've changed your mind, Carla. Good.\nCARLA WARREN: I'm sorry, Walter. (about bringing Nina)\nWALTER: You disappoint me, Doctor Warren. Go home, Nina. There's work to be done here.\nNINA: Walter, don't do this.\nWALTER: Oh, I'll be there and back before you know it.\nNINA: That's not the point. We both know that there's more to it than that.\nWALTER: (continues preparation) I don't mean to say that creating a doorway between universes is trivial. I'm simply suggesting that--\nNINA: Now if William were here--\nWALTER: William were here? He'd be applauding.\nNINA: Well, that's not true.\nWALTER: No? Then why isn't he here?\nNINA: I -- the funding, his schedule.\nWALTER: Oh, he's in Europe chasing funding? Too busy to come and stop me from destroying the universe? How many times have you rang him today? Once? Twenty? How many times has he returned your call? You know how many times that William has encouraged me to take this very risk? To expedite our espionage program? \"why simply take a peek into the other universe, Walter, when you can go there?\" So up until now, he couldn't make me find a way to try to get there until I had to find a way.\nNINA: No, I don't believe that.\nWALTER: No, no, you wouldn't, because you don't understand him. Like everyone else, you're blinded by the charming manner, the air of intelligence, the whole damn show. All William Bell ever cared about was finding a way to increase the power and the wealth and the legend of William Bell.\nNINA: Walter, regardless of what William wants, or who he is, I know why you're doing this. I understand. You know how much Peter meant to me, and how difficult it will be for me to admit that he's gone. But... this. This isn't the answer.\nWALTER: No. (moves to activate the portal) I won't let him die again. (aas the portal is established\nNINA: (tackles him as he starts to walk over to the other side) No! Walter! I won't let you do it! Walter!\nWALTER: Oh! (on the frozen lake in the alternate universe. as the portal closes) Unh! Oh!\nNINA: (on the frozen lake where she tried to stop Walter) Aah!\nCARLA WARREN: Nina!\nNINA: Help me! (as she watches her arm phase in and out of temporal focus after pulling it from the portal)\nWALTER: Oh, no. (pulls the broken vial from his chest pocket) Oh, no. (runs from the lake)\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Hey. You're supposed to be getting some rest.\nYOUNG PETER: Look. (displays his manual dexterity exercise with his coin) I've almost got it.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Okay, let's take a look. (watches, then shows him) Here, let's see, okay. It's like this. Okay, slowly. One finger at a time. Okay? (returns the coin) Slowly. Two... Three. Good job. Okay. Alright, love. (tucks him in) Now sleep, okay? Good night, sweetheart.\nYOUNG PETER: Mom?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Mm-hmm?\nYOUNG PETER: I want you to have it.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: What, Darling?\nYOUNG PETER: My lucky silver dollar.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Okay.\nYOUNG PETER: I want you to have it if I die.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Sweetheart, well...\nYOUNG PETER: It's okay. I'm not scared.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Listen. Nothing is going to happen to you. I promise. You're gonna be fine. You just need to get some rest now, okay?\nYOUNG PETER: Okay.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Alright. Okay, my love. (leaves and turns out the light)\n(a short while later, Walter enters the darkened room)\nYOUNG PETER: Dad?\nWALTER: Hello, son.\nYOUNG PETER: Dad? Are you alright?\nWALTER: Yes. Yes.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Baby, who you talking to? Walter? I -- what are you doing here? I thought you were working late at Cambridge.\nWALTER: I, uh--\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter, what are you wearing? Where did you get that coat?\nWALTER: I think I found a cure.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: What?\nWALTER: I think I found it, a cure for him.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Are you certain?\nWALTER: Yes, I believe so. I'll need to take him back to Cambridge to the lab. I need to leave now.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yes. Yeah, of course. Um, right, Peter, darling, get up. I'm going to get you dressed. Darling, let's get you out of this. (gets the show on the road) Okay. Good boy. Okay, let's... there's a good chap. Alright. Darling, we just have to go to daddy's work.\nWALTER: Elizabeth?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Mm-hmm?\nWALTER: May I have a word, please?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yeah, of course. Put the gloves on. What is it?\nWALTER: I think you should stay here.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: What?\nWALTER: The cure, there's still testing to be done, and it could take all night to find the correct dosage.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Well, I can pack a bag.\nWALTER: No. No, you haven't slept in weeks. If it works, there could be many days and weeks of recuperation. Peter will need you. He'll need you to be strong.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter...\nWALTER: No.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I'm fine.\nWALTER: Please, Liz. I need you not to doubt me.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Okay. (resighed) Okay. (rejoins her son) Oh, God, he's burning up.\nWALTER: We should leave.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You take this for luck. I love you very much.\nYOUNG PETER: I love you too, mom.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I'm going to be waiting for you right here. Okay? Okay, go on. Gloves. (to Walter) Bring him back to me.\nWALTER: I promise.\nWALTER: (walking across the frozen surface of the lake) Are you warm enough?\nYOUNG PETER: I'm cold.\nWALTER: Me too. Just a little farther.\nYOUNG PETER: Where are we going? Why aren't we taking the car?\nWALTER: We can't get where we're going in a car.\nYOUNG PETER: You're not my father, are you?\nWALTER: Of course I am. Who else would I be? I'm going to make you all better. (activates the portal back to his universe) Hold on tight, son. (walks through and arrives back amid his equipment) We did it. (the ice beneath them cracks and they fall into the frigid waters and sink)\n(losing their struggle for life in the cold water, the Bishops are joined by The Observer and plucked to safety. Walter regains his focus as a passenger in his station-wagon, en route to his lab)\nWALTER: (looks at Peter asleep under a blanket in the back seat) Is he okay?\nWALTER\/THE OBSERVER: (simultaneously) Who are you?\nWALTER: You're the man I saw... in the lab...\nWALTER\/THE OBSERVER: (simultaneously) On the other side.\nTHE OBSERVER: Your friend and the one who was injured, they left to seek medical attention. He won't live much longer. You must fix him. Your lab is six miles from here. Can you drive?\nWALTER: I think so. (after The Observer pulls the vehicle to the side of the road) Why... why did you save us?\nTHE OBSERVER: The boy is important. He has to live. (exits the car)\nCARLA WARREN: I just got off with the hospital. Doctor Bell called in a team of specialists. He has some thoughts on Nina's arm.\nWALTER: Thank you for coming in to help with Peter, after all that happened.\nCARLA WARREN: Of course, Walter. He looks better.\nWALTER: Yes. He's getting his color back. Seems to be working.\nCARLA WARREN: You're going to return him?\nWALTER: Yes. Once he's stabilized.\nCARLA WARREN: Good. I'd like to go now. (as she finds her way out)\nWALTER: Of course. Thank you.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter? (joining him in the lab) Love, you didn't come home last night. I was worried about you. I thought... (sees Young Peter from the alternate universe on the table) How?\nWALTER: He was dying, Elizabeth. This is the boy I showed you, the other Peter. It was the only way I could save him.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Oh. Oh, God. Oh, my baby. (overwhelmed) Oh, my baby.\nWALTER: Elizabeth, don't. He's not ours. I have to take him back.\nWALTER: (still sitting quietly with Olivia, finalizing his thoughts) ...and I realized at that moment that despite what I'd promised, what I fully intended to do... that I could never take Peter back. The way she looked at him, I saw in her what I feared most in myself when I saw him... that I couldn't lose him again. It was the first hole, Olivia. The first breach. The first crack in a pattern of cracks, spaces between the worlds. And it's my fault. You can't imagine what it's like to lose a child. (Olivia is left speechless by Walter's revelations)"

Tea or coffee? To warm you up?\nJAMES HEATH: No, thank you. I have trouble keeping anything down. Your office told me how busy you are. I really appreciate you coming.\nMIRANDA GREENE: I'm sorry. I keep trying to remember you.\nJAMES HEATH: I understand. It was a long time ago. We were just kids.\nMIRANDA GREENE: So is that when you think you were exposed to something?\nJAMES HEATH: I've seen about a half-dozen doctors, specialists. They think it's the only explanation that makes sense.\nMIRANDA GREENE: Well, maybe I can help you.\nJAMES HEATH: Look, I'm grateful you're doing this, but that's not why I asked to see you. I wasn't looking to make money.\nMIRANDA GREENE: Of course. I understand. But if someone's responsible for your illness, my firm can absolutely help --\nJAMES HEATH: -- The last doctor I saw, he suggested that if I could find some of the other kids we went to school with...\nMIRANDA GREENE: Uh-huh.\nJAMES HEATH: If some of them have the same symptoms, it might help him identify what it is that's making me sick.\nMIRANDA GREENE: I'm sorry. I -- I really don't remember names. Uh, it's so long ago. You know what? I do remember one boy. Um, Lloyd, um, Lloyd Becker. He made me eat a bug on the playground. I remember him.\nJAMES HEATH: Lloyd Becker?\nMIRANDA GREENE: Mm-hmm.\nJAMES HEATH: Sounds like a budding sociopath.\nMIRANDA GREENE: (laughs) Yeah, right?\nJAMES HEATH: I really appreciate you helping me out. (softly places his right hand on hers, in gratitude)\nMIRANDA GREENE: (on cell phone to associate as she drives through midtown traffic) Neil Wilson. N-E-I-L. Oh, and could you make an appointment with that oncologist over at Rhode Island General? You know, the one who always calls me 'Honey'.\nASSOCIATE: Was it Gorski?\nMIRANDA GREENE: Gorlami...\nASSOCIATE: Doctor Gorlitsky?\nMIRANDA GREENE: Gorlitsky. That's right.\nASSOCIATE: Gorlitsky. I'll call him right now.\nMIRANDA GREENE: (stops at red traffic light) Alright, thanks. I should be back in twenty minutes. Bye. (hangs-up, notices discoloration and lumps on her right wrist. keels forward in pain. light changes to green. traffic honks) Ohh!!\nCONCERNED DRIVER: (approaches on foot from stopped vehicle) Come on! Hey, what's going on in there? Miss. You okay?\nMIRANDA GREENE: Hel -- help me. (sits-up. face covered with carcinomas)\nOLIVIA: (unable to sleep, she hops out of bed and heads to the bowling alley for a friendly chat with the owner. walking in to the quiet center, she finds him tucked under a pin-setting machine, trying to repair it) Hello?\nSAM WEISS: (recognizing the voice) Is that you, Dunham? I thought you'd quit bowling, took up another sport.\nOLIVIA: It's been a while.\nSAM WEISS: I see you're still not sleeping.\nOLIVIA: Uh, not so much. No.\nSAM WEISS: Can you pass me a nut?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, sure. Which one?\nSAM WEISS: Dealer's choice. (she hands him one from a large container) Perfect. What's on your mind?\nOLIVIA: Well... after my car accident, you said that... I would experience things. I have.\nSAM WEISS: You want a beer?\nOLIVIA: Uh, it's 6:30 in the morning.\nSAM WEISS: When you've been up all night, time is just a matter of semantics. (abandons his maintenance effort and walks down the alley)\nOLIVIA: No. Thanks.\nSAM WEISS: So I suppose you're here to find out what happens next.\nOLIVIA: Suppose I am.\nSAM WEISS: I can't tell ya. You have officially gone beyond my field of expertise. But I believe I can tell you why you're not sleeping. And it has nothing to do with your accident. You're a cop. And you must make a dozen decisions a day, many of them life and death. One of them you're not happy about. You think you did the wrong thing. I'm right, aren't I?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. But it wasn't the job. Not exactly. I, uh... I agreed to keep a secret.\nSAM WEISS: A secret.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham. (listens) Okay, I'm on my way.\nSAM WEISS: It's a good thing you didn't take the beer.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I'll see you later.\nSAM WEISS: Hey, Dunham. You're a good person. You know, one of the few I know. If you agreed to keep this secret, I'm sure you had a good reason.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: (walking in from the street) Killington? As in skiing?\nWALTER: They just had a fresh snowfall.\nPETER: I had no idea you were a skier.\nWALTER: Oh, yes. I was quite a hotdogger. I remember there was this secret trail. They called it 'the backside', but not for the reason you would think. It was a nude ski run. By the time you got down to the bottom, your testicles would be in your mouth.\nPETER: I'm sure Agent Dunham is very thankful for that image. Walter's advocating a father-son trip.\nWALTER: (greets the awaiting Olivia) And I'm sure Agent Dunham is not interested in that. I understand that Agent Broyles has a body for us to look at.\nBROYLES: (as the team assembles in the examination lab) Her name is Miranda Greene. Thirty years old, unmarried. She was an attorney. Lived here in Providence. EMT's responded to a 911 call phoned in by a good samaritan. She was dead by the time they arrived. (as he interrupts an post-mortem examination in progress) Doctor. This is Agent Olivia Dunham, this is Peter Bishop, and Doctor --\nJOHN POTASH: Walter Bishop. (offers to shake hands) John Potash. I took your Advanced Biochem Seminar, Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: Oh. Oh, I apologize. I remember I was a bit of a slave driver.\nJOHN POTASH: You were. But also inspiring. The truth is I was considering changing majors, but you encouraged me to stick with it and become a doctor. I never thought I'd get a chance to thank you. (to Peter) Your father is a great man.\nOLIVIA: Doctor, um, which one is Miranda Greene?\nJOHN POTASH: Ah, um, right this way. (uncovers the corpse) I'm sorry. This might be a bit unpleasant.\nWALTER: Ah. Epidermal blistering. Tissue necrosis. Symptomatic of cytotoxins. Could you get a sample of this pus please, Peter?\nPETER: I always get the good jobs.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) According to her co-workers, when she left for lunch, she was perfectly fine. She hadn't mentioned any signs of illness. That was about two hours before the 911 call.\nJOHN POTASH: Uh, I was considering that these are contact burns from some sort of synthetic chemical.\nWALTER: No, these aren't chemical burns. They look more like malignant tumors.\nJOHN POTASH: Cancer?\nWALTER: Sarcomas, to be exact.\nJOHN POTASH: But that kind of cancer presents beneath the skin, not on the surface.\nWALTER: Normally, yes. Do you have a black light?\nJOHN POTASH: Yeah. Somewhere.\nOLIVIA: What is it, Walter?\nWALTER: I'm not sure. Cancers always start with a specific point of origin, and they spread from there, so... Hmm? Ah. (accepts black light)\nJOHN POTASH: Here you go.\nWALTER: Agent Broyles, lights, please. (room goes dark and he begins to inspect with the light) Oh. The cells near the point of origin of the cancer should show more progression, and hence refract a different color. (focuses on the right wrist) Oh. Like that.\nOLIVIA: It looks like...\nJOHN POTASH: Fingers.\nWALTER: Huh. Indeed. Right hand, I'd say. Which indicates not only what killed this woman, but also who. Of course, somehow we'll need to retrieve a print.\nJOHN POTASH: Doctor Bishop, what you're suggesting is impossible -- that someone touched this woman and gave her cancer?\nWALTER: It seems you've forgotten my very first lesson, Doctor. When you open your mind to the impossible, sometimes you find the truth.\nASTRID: Uh, twenty-eight degrees Fahrenheit, and they're predicting snow next week.\nWALTER: Hardly ideal beach weather.\nASTRID: Why are you going to Atlantic City?\nWALTER: I was thinking of taking Peter there. Used to love saltwater taffy as a child.\nASTRID: So what are we looking for? Why are we cutting off this poor woman's arm?\nWALTER: The handprint shows an extraordinary level of cellular detail. I'm hoping... hoping to be able to remove the tumor, and... bake the skin, and... hopefully identify a fingerprint. Oh, and I'll need two hot baths and an oven.\nASTRID: You really think someone may have touched her and given her cancer?\nWALTER: Terrifying possibility, but a possibility nonetheless. Oh. We need glycerin, corn starch, and food coloring.\nASTRID: Food coloring?\nWALTER: Well, not for her, but since we're baking, we may as well make some taffy. (continues sawing on the corpse)\nKEN MESSING: I've worked with Miranda for about seven years. She was fairly private, but if she was sick, I think someone would know.\nOLIVIA: So what sort of cases did Miranda usually work on, Mister Messing?\nKEN MESSING: Mostly toxic tort litigation.\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nKEN MESSING: Class action stuff. Asbestos, lead poisoning. She had a real thing about protecting those who couldn't protect themselves.\nOLIVIA: (walks into Miranda's off) And is this what she was working on?\nKEN MESSING: Yeah. She was prepping a case against INtREPUS Pharmaceuticals. Trial was supposed to start next week.\nPETER: Hmm. How much money was at stake in the trial?\nKEN MESSING: North of eight figures. (thinks) Wait, are you suggesting that -- that someone did this to her? I thought she contracted some kind of crazy disease.\nOLIVIA: Well, we're not sure, but we like to be thorough. Can we take her files on the INtREPUS Case?\nKEN MESSING: Uh, of course. Yeah.\nPETER: Miss Greene had a bunch of meetings scheduled for yesterday. Do you recognize any of those names?\nKEN MESSING: First two are deposition prep. I don't recognize the third one.\nPETER: Neil Wilson. She was supposed to meet him about an hour before she died.\nPETER: (thinking as Olivia drives) Do you really think that INtREPUS Pharmaceutical killed this woman?\nOLIVIA: Maybe. You don't?\nPETER: I've never heard of a drug that can cause what happened to Miranda Greene. It just seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through to kill somebody. Why not just hire a hit man?\nOLIVIA: Well, a hit man would draw too much attention.\nPETER: Really? And spontaneous, fatal tumor-growth wouldn't?\nOLIVIA: I suppose you have a point.\nPETER: (after she stops in front of his house to drop him off) You want to come on inside, we can noodle on it? Maybe order a pizza?\nOLIVIA: Uh, thanks, but, no. I didn't get much sleep last night, so I should probably head home. Anyway, I'm not really hungry, but, um...\nPETER: Alright.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. (later, she lays in bed, awake, late into the night)\nWALTER: (as Olivia drags herself through the door and into work) Oh, Agent Dunham. You're up early.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nASTRID: I ran Neil Wilson's number. It's a disposable cell phone, and it was deactivated yesterday. It's a pretty common name. I checked, and there's more than fifty Neil Wilsons in the Tri-State Area. Do you want me to start running them down?\nOLIVIA: Oh, no. I'm pretty sure he gave her a fake name anyway, so... Astrid, could you give Walter and I a minute?\nASTRID: Sure. Walter, don't mix up the spoons. (as she wanders away to other tasks)\nWALTER: Agent Dunham. Help me stir.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I have to tell him. I've got to tell Peter the truth.\nWALTER: (quietly, but firmly) But that's not what we discussed.\nOLIVIA: I know, and I'm sorry. But he deserves to know the truth about who he is.\nWALTER: No. No, you don't understand. Things have never been better between us. I can't lose him again. I can't.\nOLIVIA: You won't. Once he knows the whole story. Walter, you saved his life. I'm sure that he will understand.\nWALTER: No, he won't. He will never forgive me.\nOLIVIA: I -- I have to tell him. If it was the other way around, I would want him to tell me.\nWALTER: I'm begging you. Not yet. Please. Give me time to prepare. Please.\nPETER: (enters the lab with coffees) Hey. (to Olivia) I didn't realize you were coming. I would have got you one too. (starts distributing the coffee) Cappuccino. Two squirts of peppermint.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nPETER: ... and, Astrid -- Tall, nonfat, double Macchiato. Just the way you like it.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Miranda Greene used her credit card at a Downtown Providence cafe about a half hour before she died.\nPETER: Sounds like her meeting with Neil Wilson. Excellent. Well, I'm up for a road trip. How about you?\nWAITER: I remember her. Pretty lady. Comes in here all the time. She's a lawyer, right?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Do you happen to remember if she was with anyone the last time that she was here?\nWAITER: Some guy. She was taking all sorts of notes. What, does she sue doctors or something?\nOLIVIA: Excuse me?\nWAITER: Well, the guy she was with, he looked real pale and skinny. Dark circles under his eyes.\nOLIVIA: You think he was sick?\nWAITER: I'd say pretty bad. Looked like my uncle did when he was fighting cancer.\nOLIVIA: (walking away from the diner) You thinking what I'm thinking?\nPETER: Well, I'm thinking that cancer isn't contagious.\nOLIVIA: Well, it wouldn't be the strangest thing we've seen. But it would be close.\nCASHIER: (as her customer unloads his healthy food choices for checkout) Getting ready for a triathlon?\nJAMES HEATH: Just trying to stay healthy. (closes his eyes, seems queasy)\nCASHIER: You okay, sir?\nJAMES HEATH: Yeah, I just, uh...\nCASHIER: You need me to call for some help?\nJAMES HEATH: No. No, I'm fine. (runs outside to vomit)\nJAMES HEATH: (on a random phone call) Yes, I'm an old friend of Mister Becker's. We went to school together. (coughing virulently) Oh. I must have the wrong Lloyd Becker. I'm sorry to bother you. (hangs-up)\nOLIVIA: Walter, Miranda Greene had lunch with someone just before she died, with -- with a man that may have had cancer. Does that suggest anything to you?\nWALTER: Cancer isn't contagious, of course.\nPETER: That's what I said.\nWALTER: Although... are you familiar with the Chinese notion of Ch'i, Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: No.\nWALTER: Dim Mak.\nPETER: (knowingly) The Touch of Death.\nWALTER: Exactly. The Chinese believe that all living creatures contain an energy, or Ch'i, and, that with proper training, a simple touch can affect their Ch'i. Reverse it. Can cause sickness, even death.\nPETER: Except, of course, they can't. 'cause the Touch of Death is just a legend.\nWALTER: Of course, what would be more interesting wouldn't be a transfer of energy, but an exchange.\nOLIVIA: Meaning what?\nWALTER: This other man, you say that he was sick too, that he had cancer as well?\nOLIVIA: Possibly.\nWALTER: And at the time she met him, Miss Greene was perfectly healthy.\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: Then I suggest what we're looking at here adheres more closely to tantric sex.\nOLIVIA: Sex?\nWALTER: Yes. In so far as the goal of tantric sex is a heightened state of perception, of awareness. The partners are not interested merely in the sexual experience. They are seeking an exchange of energy.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so what does this have to do with Miranda Greene?\nWALTER: His cancer... for her health. It's possible that the man that Miss Greene met did this to her as a way to delay the progression of his own disease.\nLLOYD BECKER: (answers a door knock) Hi.\nJAMES HEATH: Lloyd Becker?\nLLOYD BECKER: Oh, yeah, right. You're Alex.\nJAMES HEATH: Alex Taylor. Thanks for seeing me.\nLLOYD BECKER: Of course. Yeah. How you doing? (shakes his gloved hand) Come on in.\nJAMES HEATH: Thanks.\nBROYLES: Victim's name is Lloyd Becker. Thirty. A neighbor saw his door open. She came in and discovered his body. There's no sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle.\nWALTER: (studies the heavily tumored man) Clusters of malignant sarcomas. Just like Miss Greene.\nOLIVIA: Did anyone see the suspect?\nBROYLES: Police canvassed the building and the neighborhood. No luck.\nWALTER: Huh. The malignancies appear to originate in this hand and then appear to spread out.\nPETER: Maybe from a handshake.\nWALTER: That's a fine deduction, Peter.\nBROYLES: What do you see?\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) Nothing. Nothing that tells me why Lloyd Becker was chosen as a victim. But there must be a connection. (outside as Peter hops in the car) Where's Walter?\nPETER: (after closing the aft doors on the ambulance) The M.E.'s gonna transport the body back to the lab. He told Walter he could ride along.\nOLIVIA: (as Peter studies her as they drive) What?\nPETER: It's nothing. I -- I think I know what it is that's bothering you, why it is you've been so awkward around me for the last couple of weeks.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: That trip down to Jacksonville was crazy. We were both exhausted. We were both emotional. And, you know, if something had happened between the two of us, I mean, if we had actually kissed, then we'd have to deal with that, but we didn't.\nOLIVIA: No. No, we didn't.\nPETER: Right. You know, this past year, this is the longest I've ever stayed in one place. So this thing that we have, you, me, Walter, this... this... uh, little family unit that we've got going... I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.\nOLIVIA: I don't either.\nPETER: Okay, so we're good then, right?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Good.\nASTRID: I found more victims. Five deaths over the past 20 months, from Chicago to Hartford. Each person died from the same kind of rapid-onset cancer. (as she posts photos on a situation map)\nPETER: And healthy people keeling over like this didn't set off any alarm bells?\nASTRID: Well, a couple were considered medical anomalies, and local police looked into another, but nothing suggested it was murder.\nOLIVIA: So what is it about these people that's making them targets? Astrid, we need to cross-reference their files, see if we can find what they may have in common.\nASTRID: Alright. I'm on it.\nOLIVIA: (studies a photo) Timothy Ober. (to Astrid) Is his middle name Michael?\nASTRID: Um, yeah. Timothy Michael Ober.\nPETER: Why? You know him? (Olivia nods yes) How?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\n(Olivia looks at the case files while pouring a glass of whisky, then answers a knock at the door with her service pistol ready)\nSAM WEISS: What's up, Buttercup?\nOLIVIA: (surprised at the house call) It's past midnight.\nSAM WEISS: Do you feel like playing a game?\nOLIVIA: Clue?\nSAM WEISS: Yeah. I thought it might be up your alley. (after settling down to play the game) Colonel Mustard with the revolver in the billiard room.\nOLIVIA: See, that's the third time that you've guessed the billiard room.\nSAM WEISS: I've always wanted a billiard room.\nOLIVIA: I thought that you would make a better detective.\nSAM WEISS: I detected that you needed company.\nOLIVIA: huh..\nSAM WEISS: You've lived here a while, but you're still living out of boxes. Maybe you moved around a lot as a kid. A tumultuous childhood. A hard time forming relationships. I may not be the gumshoe you are, but I've got some skills.\nOLIVIA: Well, you're right about moving around a lot. I was a military brat.\nSAM WEISS: That would explain the uniform.\nOLIVIA: (baffled) The uniform?\nSAM WEISS: Yeah, bland clothes. I don't think I've ever seen you in a primary color. It's because it's more than a job to you. You're a soldier. Protector.\nOLIVIA: God, you'd be a blast at dinner parties.\nSAM WEISS: I don't get invited to many.\nOLIVIA: No. So what about you? What made you the way you are?\nSAM WEISS: Oh, I don't know. I'm older than I look. I barely remember my childhood. I'm also taller than I appear.\nOLIVIA: That's it. (gets up and heads for a notepad in her desk)\nSAM WEISS: What? (genuinely confused) What did I say?\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Uh, when we were in Jacksonville, there was a height chart on the wall with names. First name and last initial. All the kids that I was in daycare with.\nPETER: Yeah, all the kids from Walter and Bell's Cortexiphan trials.\nOLIVIA: So while I was there, I wrote down all their names and I made a list. (points to list) \"Timothy O.\" Timothy Ober. He was there. We were both part of Walter's tests.\nPETER: So that's where you remembered him from.\nOLIVIA: Uh-huh. Keep looking.\nPETER: Miranda G. And Lloyd B. ...\nOLIVIA: ...Julie H. Alan D. They're all there. All five of his victims.\nPETER: So what does that mean? Why is this guy?...\nOLIVIA: ...killing Cortexiphan kids? I don't know. I think we should wake up Walter.\nPETER: That won't be necessary.\nWALTER: (as the duo joins him in his kitchen) Agent Dunham. Peter. Is it morning already?\nPETER: Oh, no. No, no. It's still the middle of the night.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what is that smell?\nWALTER: It's taffy. I'm making it for Peter.\nPETER: I think she was probably referring to your other project.\nOLIVIA: (as she scans a pizza-like object in the oven) Is that the killer's handprint?\nWALTER: (candidly) I think we're close to getting a fingerprint. The papillary ridges on the forefingers are quite clear now. Once it's cooled a little, I should be able to run it through the scanner.\nPETER: Well, whoever the killer is, he's started to target Cortexiphan subjects.\nWALTER: (surprised) Are you sure?\nPETER: Yeah.\nWALTER: Why? Why would he do that?\nOLIVIA: Well, we were hoping you may have some idea.\nWALTER: I don't know. But I have an idea why they might be susceptible.\nOLIVIA: To the cancer?\nWALTER: The energy exchange that this man is creating, I don't think it would work on everyone. Cortexiphan was designed to -- to allow children to access untapped parts of their brain, untapped energies.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that whatever he's doing to his victims, like, exchanging his illness, it could only work on Cortexiphan children.\nWALTER: Yes. I think so.\nPETER: So then I guess the question really is, how does he know about the Cortexiphan trials? And then how is he tracking those people down?\nOLIVIA: Now, you've said that you and Bell never kept a list of the children that you experimented on.\nWALTER: I didn't. And if Belly did, I never saw it.\nOLIVIA: Okay, but what about Nina Sharp? I mean, she started working with Bell around the same time.\nPETER: Mm-mm. We asked. Last year. When Harris was tracking down Nick Lane and Nancy Lewis, we asked her. She doesn't have a list.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, but I believe that Nina Sharp isn't always so forthcoming.\nNINA: Why would someone be hunting Cortexiphan test subjects?\nOLIVIA: Uh, I don't know. Walter thinks that they could be particularly susceptible.\nNINA: Ah. That's troubling.\nOLIVIA: Did William Bell ever show you a list?\nNINA: Of Cortexiphan subjects?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nNINA: No.\nOLIVIA: And there's nothing in the Massive Dynamic archives?\nNINA: As I've told you before, there's nothing on record. Do you doubt me Agent Dunham?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I've always been a little foggy as to your motives.\nNINA: What are you implying?\nOLIVIA: Well, you've kept information from me since I met you -- information that has prevented me from understanding the origin of many, if not all of the cases I've investigated while working with Fringe Division. And I know about Peter. I know the whole story.\nNINA: (concerned) Does Peter know? Have you told him?\nOLIVIA: No. But I'm going to.\nNINA: (confidently) No. You won't.\nOLIVIA: What makes you so sure about that?\nNINA: Because you haven't told him yet. And I'm guessing you've had any number of opportunities.\nOLIVIA: Well, I've had my reasons for waiting. This is the right thing to do, and Peter needs to know the truth.\nNINA: Whether or not it's the right thing to do, I recognize the look in your eyes. I know that working together closely with someone can bring about feelings. I'm fairly certain that you're not prepared to lose him. You didn't come here today to ask me about a list that you already knew I don't have. And you didn't come here to announce that you're going to tell Peter who he really is. You came here... to have me talk you out of it.\nJAMES HEATH: (after she answers his knock on her door) Mrs. Lane?\nMRS. LANE: Yes.\nJAMES HEATH: I'm sorry to disturb you. I -- I tried calling. My name is John McHugh. I went to school with your son, Nick.\nMRS. LANE: Uh, no, Nick is my nephew.\nJAMES HEATH: Oh. Uh... (in pain) Ah.\nMRS. LANE: (kindly) You -- you look awful. Why don't you come inside?\nJAMES HEATH: Thank you. (as he trundles into the house)\nWALTER: (as he adjusts the cancerous sample for inspection) The red wire goes in the red hole. The blue in--\nPETER: Yes, thank you, Walter. I was able to figure that out all by myself. (as Olivia marches into the lab) Hey. How'd it go?\nOLIVIA: Uh, Nina didn't have anything. How's it going here?\nPETER: Well, we'll soon see.\nWALTER: Don't be so skeptical, Peter. You liked the taffy, didn't you?\nPETER: Absolutely. (sidebar to Olivia) I have my doubts.\nWALTER: Ready? (activates the scan of the sample)\nOLIVIA: What's it doing?\nWALTER: Familiarizing itself with the genetic composition. (as they study the read-out) Dismissing any foreign elements. It's amazing how much filth we carry around on our hands. (wipes his hands with liquid sanitizer) Go ahead, Dear. (to Astrid)\nASTRID: It worked.\nWALTER: Of course it did. (of course)\nOLIVIA: Okay, Astrid, we need to run this through the joint law enforcement database. See if we can get a name for this guy.\nPETER: Well done, Walter.\nWALTER: Thank you, son.\nASTRID: (as the database check finishes) Nothing. He's not in our system. No priors, no arrest record.\nWALTER: So... we're nowhere.\nMRS. LANE: You said you went to school with Nick.\nJAMES HEATH: A long time ago, back in Jacksonville. We have a mutual friend, Lloyd Becker. He said I could find Nick here.\nMRS. LANE: I remember Lloyd. Oh, such a sweet boy. Nick lived here a while after his parents died. He moved to Brooklyn... several years ago.\nJAMES HEATH: Do you -- do you know how I could get in contact with him? Do you have his phone number?\nMRS. LANE: I'm afraid not. I haven't heard from him for some time. It's funny, though. Someone else from Jacksonville came by, oh, six months ago asking for Nick. She must have gone to school with you as well.\nJAMES HEATH: You don't by any chance remember her name, do you?\nOLIVIA: (studies her list and compares to the files she has) God, what am I missing? (then quickly calls her boss)\nBROYLES: (answers his cell phone) Dunham?\nOLIVIA: I think I may have found our killer. His name is James Heath, and he was a Cortexiphan subject too. I think that may be how he's doing this.\nBROYLES: James Heath? Wasn't heath the last name of the first--\nOLIVIA: Yep, of the first victim -- Julie Heath, uh, she was his sister. James was in the hospital. She was visiting him, and she just suddenly collapsed and died. He was, uh, he was having chemo treatment. He had cancer.\nBROYLES: Do you have the name of the hospital where Heath was treated?\nOLIVIA: Uh, yeah. It's Abington Memorial Hospital. It's just outside Philadelphia.\nBROYLES: Okay. I'll see if they have a current address for him.\nOLIVIA: Thanks. (as she hangs-up and exits her apartment)\nJAMES HEATH: (greeting her in the common hallway) You're Olivia Dunham. You probably don't remember me. My name is Nate Reed. Nick Lane gave me your address?\nJAMES HEATH: You and I went to school together when we were kids. Back in Jacksonville.\nOLIVIA: I see. What can I do for you?\nJAMES HEATH: I was hoping you'd have a few minutes to talk.\nOLIVIA: Sure. Why don't you come in? (he spies the badge on her belt and she races inside to secure the door. he forces entry and she crashes to the floor, losing her weapon. he tries to touch her and she defends herself with a lamp stand. he falls to the floor. she speed-dials Peter)\nPETER: (answers cell phone) Hello?\nOLIVIA: (desperate) Peter. Peter, Peter, it's me. He's in my house! (kicks him away, then clobbers Heath with a candlestick) You stay down.\nJAMES HEATH: I didn't want this. I didn't want to hurt anyone.\nOLIVIA: Then why did you?\nJAMES HEATH: A man came to see me when I was in the hospital. He said when I was a kid, scientists had experimented on me, that because of the experiments, he could teach me how to fight the cancer. But it didn't work. I didn't get better. I got worse.\nOLIVIA: So what happened to your sister?\nJAMES HEATH: She stayed with me while I was in the hospital. She never left my side. And when the pain got bad, she'd hold my hand. For hours. And then, one day, it just happened. I called the nurses for help, but it was too late. I watched her die.\nOLIVIA: But you got better.\nJAMES HEATH: I had to find that man. I thought someone from Jacksonville might know him. And then I found Timothy.\nOLIVIA: And you killed him too.\nJAMES HEATH: Not on purpose. It just happened. But that's when I realized how it worked. I think... if that man had never... come to see me, I would have died the way I was supposed to, and my sister would still be alive. They'd all still be alive. (holds Olivia's photo of his sister, Julie)\nUNIFORMED COP: (racing to her open door) In here.\nOLIVIA: (calming the first responder) It's okay.\nPETER: (later, as Heath is hauled away) How come you didn't call Broyles?\nOLIVIA: I've got you on speed dial.\nPETER: Really? I'm number one on Olivia Dunham's speed dial?\nOLIVIA: Well, no, but I didn't think that Rachel or Mister Iyer from the Indian takeout would be much use. Peter... thank you for coming.\nPETER: You're welcome.\nBROYLES: He's in a drug-induced coma, which seems to have stopped the progression of his cancer.\nNINA: (watching through an observation window) And the man who tried to activate him, do we know who he was?\nBROYLES: He sounds like the same man who Sanford Harris hired to activate Nancy Lewis and Nick Lane. I assume the activation failed, and Mister Heath's... ability was just an unfortunate side effect.\nNINA: Hmm. So I don't imagine you called me all the way down here just to share in your victory.\nBROYLES: Aside from Olivia Dunham, there are still nearly a dozen unaccounted for people from the Jacksonville experiments, and thirty more from the drug trials in Wooster. If they all have capabilities anything like the ones we've seen, and if someone were to find them...\nNINA: Well, Phillip, (thoughtfully) then we need to find them first.\nWALTER: (answering his front door) Agent Dunham. Hello.\nOLIVIA: Hi. Uh, is Peter here?\nWALTER: Uh, no. No, he went out.\nOLIVIA: Okay, good, because I would like to talk to you.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham --\nOLIVIA: Walter, please. Please, Walter. Just... let me finish. I think that you may be right. I think that maybe some truths can do more harm than good and that some Pandora's Boxes are better left unopened. So... I'm not gonna tell Peter.\nWALTER: Thank you, Olivia. Well, the truth is I've done enough damage, and it's time to start to put things right... whatever the consequences. And that starts with telling Peter the truth. I have to tell him who he really is."

(ignored, he approaches a lady) Excuse me, ma'am. Do you have any spare change? (ignored again) Thank you. God bless. (approaches a business man with a God could be Watching poster) Excuse me, sir. Do you have any spare change?\nCOMMUTER: No. No, I'm sorry.\nTEENAGER: Anything you can manage, Sir, anything you can... (bumps the man, and pickpockets his wallet) Thank you. God bless you anyways, sir. (continues away from the man he robbed)\nPLATFORM ANNOUNCER: Now approaching on Track 18, the 331 Express train to Providence.\n(onboard the moving train, a whirring noise alarms the passengers and a bright blue light appears at the end of the car. the light grows in intensity and a man steps through the temporal window he created. the car goes dark and commuters sit silently as the train comes to a stop in the station. Alistair Peck steps from the car and is immediately solicited)\nTEENAGER: Spare change? (Peck ignores the panhandler and walks down the platform. The panhandler steps onto the train and into a car full of corpses. the departure bell sounds and the train leaves the station, trapping him with the bodies) Oh, God. Oh, God. No, no, please! Let me outta here! Help! Let me outta here!\n(Walter sits at home writing a letter to Peter, when the phone rings. Walter lets the answering machine take the call, and listen to the message instead)\nANSWERING MACHINE: (recorded by Peter) Leave a message. (beep)\nPETER: (calling his dad for work) It's Peter, pick up. Hey Walter, it's Peter. Your son, Peter. Come on, Walter, pick up the phone. Walter, pick up the receiver, and hit the square black button next to the red flashing light, you remember? (pauses) Alright, fine. When you get this, I want you to get your kit to together, I just got off the phone with Olivia, she said there was an incident on a train, and I know how much you love trains. Though it might cheer you up. Be home to pick you up in about 15 minutes, alright? (Peter hangs-up. Walter smiles, folds the letter, seals it in an envelope, and places it into the right pocket of his sweater)\n(walking toward the commuter car with the dead bodies)\nPETER: Noticed anything weird?\nOLIVIA: Not yet, but give it ten minutes.\nPETER: I was actually talking about Walter.\nWALTER: (to agents already on the scene) Hello. I'm Doctor Walter Bishop.\nPETER: He's been avoiding me all week. He didn't even look at me on the car ride over here. He's stopped eating. I got him a new box of Peak Freans. He hasn't even opened it.\nOLIVIA: Well, did he say something?\nPETER: No, all week it feels like he's been enveloped in this... sadness.\nOLIVIA: I haven't noticed anything. (she continues ahead)\nWALTER: Oh, my. (enters the car and begins to examine the corpses)\nFEMALE CSI: (confrontational) Sir. What are you doing?\nWALTER: I'm checking their underwear.\nFEMALE CSI: Their underwear?\nWALTER: I'm sure you're familiar that with sudden death, victims often experience a sudden bladder release of urine, and sometimes excrement.\nFEMALE CSI: Get off this train.\nOLIVIA: (intercepting the CSI) He's with me. Thank you.\nWALTER: I don't know what happened to these people, Agent Dunham. My first guess is collective heart failure.\nPETER: You think these people died from having a heart attack at the same time?\nWALTER: Perhaps it was sympathetic. Contagious, like yawning.\nPETER: Come on, Walter. You really believe that?\nOLIVIA: (after looking around) Walter, does your theory suggest why all the lights would be out in this car?\nWALTER: No, there should be battery backup, unless it wasn't serviced properly.\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham? (exits the car and approaches the young male witness) He crossed paths with the man as he entered the train car. Six foot, brown hair, wearing a trench coat.\nOLIVIA: And he's sure that he saw him coming out of this train car.\nBROYLES: The man didn't speak to him or acknowledge him. He just exited down the stairs of the platform.\nOLIVIA: Did we pick him up on surveillance?\nBROYLES: I'm waiting to get word if they can pull him on any footage.\nPETER: (leaves the commuter car with evidence) Agent Dunham.\nM.E. TECH: (finds Walters letter on the floor) Hey, Rod, found this over there. (hands the letter to an investigator)\nWALTER: (sees the errant envelope) Oh, my God. Excuse me, gentlemen. (moves quickly to retrieve it) That's mine. Thank you. Thank you.\nPETER: (re-enters the car) All the batteries are dead. It's not just the lights that went out. This is her cell phone, but they're all dead. All the cell phones, laptops, MP3 players. They're all completely drained of power.\nBROYLES: Any theories, Doctor Bishop?\nWALTER: Oh, no. Except my initial theory of collective heart failure is probably incorrect. I'll need to take some of these bodies back to the lab. Six or seven should suffice.\nAGENT: (approaches with photos) We have an image from the platform cameras.\nPETER: Who is this guy?\nOLIVIA: And how did he kill everything on this train?\nWALTER: (as he and Astrid probe the corpses from the train) This is unusual. Dying organisms struggle for their last breath, but these people appear as if their switches have simply been turned off.\nPETER: (enters from outside) Hey, how's it coming in here?\nASTRID: Hi, Peter. Not very good.\nWALTER: Take samples of this man's lung, brain, and skin. Something's not right here.\nASTRID: Yup, I think it's my paycheck.\nWALTER: Hmm? (distracted)\nPETER: Whatever it is, I'm sure you're gonna make sense out of it, Walter. Walter. What's going on with you? Is there something wrong? Something you wanna talk about?\nWALTER: No, everything's fine. Astro, show me those previous cellular samples, please. (studying the readout) That's extraordinary.\nASTRID: The ATP concentrations are unusually low.\nWALTER: Cellular process should continue for hours, even after death, but this man's mitochondria seems to have ceased functioning well before it should.\nASTRID\/WALTER: (in unison) What do you say I take samples of the rest both: And see if there's a trend?\nPETER: So what are you saying, Walter? That something was able to reach inside of these people's mitochondria and just --\nWALTER: Drain them, like the batteries in all of the electrical devices on the train. It wasn't just their hearts that stopped beating. It was every cell in their bodies.\nPETER: What do you think could possibly do something like that?\nWALTER: (bluntly) I have no idea.\nBROYLES: (standing behind technicians, facing large monitors) Twenty years ago a person walking through Boston for two hours showed up on an average of ten different surveillance cameras. Now, it's hundreds.\nOLIVIA: Bad for privacy, but good for us.\nBROYLES: I've asked them to output each source to a different monitor. Give us a sense of the route our suspect took. Play it. He exits the train station, crossing Ferris Avenue, continuing North. This is from the bank on Howard Street. Coming around the corner. (watching as Peck appears on different monitors) There, he enters a cafe. He spent almost forty-five minutes inside, then left the establishment.\nOLIVIA: The guy kills a train full of people and then stops for a meal?\nBROYLES: And the trail goes cold there. Once he left the cafe, we couldn't locate him on any other cameras.\nOLIVIA: But we have a place to start. Cafe Wilusa.\nWAITRESS: (standing near the register at the busy eatery) Yeah, he was here this morning. He comes in all the time. Weird guy.\nOLIVIA: Weird how?\nWAITRESS: Well, he always draws on stuff, like the napkins and the placemats.\nOLIVIA: Well, what sort of stuff does he draw?\nWAITRESS: Some kind of math, I think. To be honest, my higher math ends at calculating my tip, so...\nOLIVIA: Does he ever pay with a credit card?\nWAITRESS: Sometimes he does. (checks register and removes receipt) Here. This is him.\nOLIVIA: Alistair Peck. Thank you. This will really help.\n(a team of agents enter the unoccupied building with weapons drawn and spread out)\nAGENTS: Clear. Clear. Clear.\nOLIVIA: (on the radio once upstairs) Send the Bishops up, please.\nWALTER: (inspecting the math written all over room) These mathematical formulae are extraordinarily complex. Physicists use diagrams like these to shorthand ideas about how subatomic particles behave. These are sublime.\nPETER: (finds a college degree in a broken frame) This may explain his flourish for numerical wallpapering. Astrophysics. He teaches at M.I.T.\nWALTER: If I comprehend this correctly, then this Alistair Peck has taken Einstein's Theory of Relativity and turned it on its ear. I grasp portions of it, Tachyons are depicted here, but I fail to see their relevance. However, it does confirm that Doctor Peck was dealing with tremendous energy to do... whatever it is he's doing.\nALISTAIR PECK: (returns to his house as his possessions are being loaded for hauling) What are you doing with my things?\nAGENT: (on radio) Peck is here, he's downstairs. (the science team hurries downstairs)\nPETER: (notices the vast scarring on Peck) I guess that explains what all the surgical tools were for.\nOLIVIA: What did you do to the people on that train? Twelve innocent people.\nALISTAIR PECK: (certain) Those people aren't dead, Miss. Not permanently.\nOLIVIA: Of course they're dead.\nALISTAIR PECK: But they soon won't be. Although, others soon will be, I'm afraid.\nOLIVIA: Doctor Peck, I want you to lie down on the ground now.\nALISTAIR PECK: Don't take my computations! They're meaningless to you. It is well within my ability to make it so that you are never in possession of the things I require.\nWALTER: You've implanted a Faraday Mesh. (points to Pecks attachments)\nPETER: What are you talking about, Walter?\nWALTER: A shield, to create a temporal pocket around your body. Of course.\nPETER: Of course, what? Why would he need a temporal pocket?\nWALTER: That's fantastic.\nOLIVIA: (as Peck begins to shift to another time) Doctor Peck, what are you doing? Doctor Peck?\nPETER: (as Peck comes in and out of visual focus) Walter, what's happening?\n(in a blue light, Peck reappears on the commuter train)\nTEENAGER: (trying to panhandle Peck as he exits the train full of dead commuters) Spare change?\nALISTAIR PECK: I'm sorry you have to go through this again. (continues on his way)\nTEENAGER: (trapped in the train car with a dozen corpses) Oh, God. Oh, God.\n(Walter sits at home writing a letter to Peter, when the phone rings. Walter lets the answering machine take the call, and listen to the message instead)\nANSWERING MACHINE: (recorded by Peter) Leave a message. (beep)\nPETER: (calling his dad for work) Hey, Walter, it's Peter. Your son, Peter. (pauses) Alright, fine. When you get this, I want you to get your kit together. I just got off the phone with Olivia. She said there was an incident on a train, and I know how much you love trains. Thought it might cheer you up. I'm coming home to pick you up in fifteen minutes, alright?\n(walking toward the commuter car with the dead bodies)\nPETER: Have you noticed anything weird?\nOLIVIA: Not yet, but give it ten minutes.\nPETER: I was actually talking about Walter.\nWALTER: (to agents already on the scene) Excuse me. I'm Doctor Walter Bishop. Is this the car?\nAGENT: Right over there.\nWALTER: Must be the car. Oh, my.\nAGENT: And there's nothing else you can give me? No other information? Here's the initial report.\nPETER: You think these people died from having a heart attack at the same time?\nWALTER: Perhaps it was sympathetic. Contagious, like yawning.\nOLIVIA: Walter, does your theory suggest why all the lights would be out in this car?\nWALTER: No, there should be battery backup. Unless it wasn't serviced properly. I'll need to take some of these bodies back to the lab. Six or seven should suffice.\nBROYLES: (enters the car) Agent Dunham? (leaves with her to interview the panhandler outside the car) He crossed paths with the suspect as he entered the train car. Says the man was in a raincoat. Six foot, brown hair. Says he touched the hand rail. We're dusting for prints.\nOLIVIA: Hi there. Uh, the man from the train -- Did he say something to you?\nTEENAGER: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: What did he say?\nTEENAGER: 'I'm sorry you have to go through this again'.\nOLIVIA: Again? And what then?\nTEENAGER: He stepped off the stairs and walked away.\nPETER: (leaves the car and interrupts the interview) Agent Broyles, Agent Dunham. All the batteries are dead. All the cell phones, laptops -- they're completely drained of power.\nM.E. TECH: Hey, Ron... look, I found this on the floor over there. (Walter's letter to Peter)\nWALTER: Oh, my God. Oh, thank you, thank you! That - that - that's mine. (retrieves his letter)\nRON: He found it on the floor up there.\nWALTER: Oh? Oh. Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (on phone to the lab) The mitochondria were depleted?\nPETER: Yup, completely drained. The victims didn't die of a group heart attack, they were just completely drained of biological energy.\nOLIVIA: Just like their phone batteries.\nPETER: Pretty much. How is the question. Walter's still working on it. I'll let you know if he finds out anything else.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (hangs-up)\nBROYLES: (exiting an office) Dunham... we managed to I.D. the print we lifted off the train car railing. We got lucky. (hands her a file folder) They matched a set NASA has on file.\nOLIVIA: (studies the file) Doctor Alistair Peck. What did he do at NASA?\nBROYLES: He was classified as part of a think tank. We don't know much more than that, yet.\nOLIVIA: Well, we know that he lives here. 412 Inman Street.\nTACTICAL TEAM: (charging through the empty house) Clear. Clear. Clear.\nOLIVIA: (on her radio) Send the Bishops up, please.\nWALTER: Mister Peck may have done project work for NASA, but he's employed locally.\nOLIVIA: Astrophysics. He teaches at M.I.T.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: Wow, I'm having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nPETER: Yeah, I read that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is fate's way of telling you that you're exactly where you're supposed to be. That's why you feel like you've been there before. You are right in line with you're own destiny.\nOLIVIA: Well, do you believe that?\nPETER: Mmm... no. It's a bit mystical for my taste. I never get them, myself. Maybe that's 'cause I'm not on track with my own destiny. Huh, look at this.\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nPETER: A photo album.\nOLIVIA: Okay. But who are you? (sees a picture of Peck with a female friend) What's your name? Huh. (finds blue and pink toothbrushes near the sink) Well, one of them is bound to be back sooner or later. Hopefully sooner.\nWALTER: (privately) Shall we go home now? I'm tired of waiting. Olivia... might I come with you? In your car? I can't drive home with him. I can't look at him.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you can't keep doing this. Peter knows that something's upsetting you.\nWALTER: I've written him a letter. Instead of me stammering in fits and starts, a letter is more concise. It explains everything in just the right words. Except that every time I think I'm ready to tell him, I envision his reaction when he reads it and I run the scene in my mind again and again. And every time, the outcome is terrible. But I will do it. But first... there's something I'm waiting for, Agent Dunham -- something important.\nPETER: (returns with round metal objects) Hey, guys, check this out. Templates. Forms.\nOLIVIA: What are they for?\nPETER: Well, they're what you'd use to cast machine parts, but these look like they were handmade.\nWALTER: This one is dated several months ago, This one even earlier. He refers to them as prototypes.\nPETER: But prototypes for what?\n(in a machine shop, Peck grinds objects and prepares to insert them in his badly scarred torso)\nCAROL BRYCE: (sitting in her office) Alistair Peck was a professor here for six years. His focus -- obsession -- was particle acceleration. Um, creating wormholes without a particle collider.\nPETER: Alright, you're saying that Doctor Peck's area of expertise was time travel?\nCAROL BRYCE: He kept cranking out theories, and eventually every one of them was over our heads.\nOLIVIA: That must have been frustrating for his superiors.\nCAROL BRYCE: Embarrassing is a better classification. They wanted to fire Alistair but he saved them the trouble and left, about a year ago.\nOLIVIA: (hands-over photo) Is this his wife?\nCAROL BRYCE: Ah, the fianc\u00e9e. Her name is Arlette.\nPETER: Do you remember her last name?\nCAROL BRYCE: I don't recall, no.\nPETER: Do you know any other friends he might have had? People he knew?\nCAROL BRYCE: That's the sad thing. He was kind to everyone, but he never socialized. I think I was his only friend.\nOLIVIA: Well, anything that you can remember about Mister Peck, it could be important.\nCAROL BRYCE: Alistair sent me these about six months ago to proofread. (retrieves a stack of thick journals) He had hopes of seeing them published.\nOLIVIA: Uh, can we take them?\nCAROL BRYCE: They're only gathering dust here. They are pretty dense. Most would say it's gobbledygook.\nOLIVIA: Well, I happen to know someone who's fluent in gobbledygook.\nWALTER: I'm finished. (pacing the lab) In another twenty years, with the assistance of some other great minds, I will have absorbed this information. Alistair Peck has conceived of some extraordinary theories and is possibly implementing them.\nPETER: Meaning what?\nWALTER: He may well be able to travel through time. Conceivably. Einstein himself theorized this. (starts writing on a sheet of paper) 10:00 A.M...11:00 A.M. He said that if something could propel an object faster than the speed of light, then time would appear to bend. (joins the two ends of the timeline on the paper) When those two folds connect, a tremendous amount of energy is required to absorb the jump.\nPETER: From any power source. So the laptops, the phones...\nOLIVIA: ...and anyone who was near him.\nWALTER: Yes.\nPETER: Then what you're saying, Walter, is that Peck's moving through time is what killed all of these people on the train.\nWALTER: That is my theory, yes, and Olivia, if it is right, then we may well have apprehended this man already. Possibly several times.\nASTRID: I found his fianc\u00e9e. The car in one of the photo album pictures is registered to an Arlette Turling. Her license information is coming through.\nOLIVIA: Okay, that's her. Find out whatever you can. She's our only connection to Peck.\nWALTER: third volume is unfinished. (looking through one of the journals from Bryce) There's a handwritten segment at the back, then the writing stops. The unfinished chapter is entitled 'Achieving The Arlette Principle'.\nOLIVIA: What'd you just say?\nWALTER: 'Achieving The Arlette Principle'.\nOLIVIA: (looking at Astrid's monitor) I think I know why Peck is doing this. Arlette Turling was killed in a car accident Ten months ago.\nASTRID: On the 18th of May.\nOLIVIA: What if Alistair Peck is going back to save her?\nWALTER: (timidly) Grief can drive people to extraordinary lengths. Now, considering the amount of energy that was drawn when he landed at the station this morning, using Peck's own theories, I estimate that we witnessed just a twelve hour jump. ten month jump... the results would be devastating.\nOLIVIA: Well, how many casualties?\nWALTER: It would depend where he landed. Hundreds.\nASTRID: (later, after researching, the team gathers at her monitor) This is weird. I did a search for Peck's cell phone when we first I.D.'d him as a suspect. He didn't have one, but Arlette Turling's number is still active. Someone's paying the bill. Now, in the past twenty-four hours, the primary cell tower that's been handling the signal from Arlette's cell phone is a tower near Albany Street.\nWALTER: well, what's near Albany Street?\nPETER: M.I.T.\nOLIVIA: Well, what's he doing at M.I.T.? The professor said that she hadn't seen him for almost a year.\nASTRID: Well, Walter has a lab here, maybe Peck has a lab there.\n(the tactical assault team rallies outside the lab as SAIC Broyles approaches)\nND AGENT #2: (hold out files) According to the files, the lab registered to Peck when he was a professor here was Lab 107.\nBROYLES: Are there any windows in that lab? (agent nods yes) Get your men on the rooftops.\nWALTER: (just arriving) Are those guns really necessary?\nPETER: You okay? Want me to take you back home?\nWALTER: No, Peter, no,\nPETER: Just stay there. (leaves) Agent Broyles...\nWALTER: (approaching) Agent Dunham. If we are correct, and, for Peck, this is about bringing a dead loved-one back to life, then Peck and I, we have something in common. Let me speak to him.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I --\nWALTER: Of course I know that killing him is the only way to ensure that he won't jump, but if I could talk to him, I think I can convince him to stop this. Please.\nOLIVIA: Let's talk to Broyles. (walks off)\n(in his lab, after painful self-surgery, Peck inserts his hand-crafted devices under his skin)\nWALTER: (Walter enters, turns-off the music and raises his hands) Wait. I am not a threat. I am an ambassador.\nALISTAIR PECK: I know who you are. You're Doctor Walter bishop. I've read you. New Frontiers In Genetic Hybridization.\nWALTER: And I know that if you wanted to, you could disappear from here in a second. Please, trust me.\nALISTAIR PECK: (stands preparing a pot of tea) You and I both know there are certain things we take for granted -- the laws of nature for example -- that are not necessarily binding. There are places on this Earth where two plus two most definitely does not equal four. (pours tea for the both of them)\nWALTER: (sitting calmly) You've figured out how to bend time. But you're only interested in traveling to the past. Your goal, your next jump is the 18th of May.\nALISTAIR PECK: So you know. The 18th of May. Yes.\nWALTER: (as Peck wanders near the big windows) Don't do that! Don't stand there! There are snipers outside. Stay away from the window!\nBROYLES: (to Olivia and Peter as they wait in the car) I hope he knows what he's doing.\nALISTAIR PECK: Why are you here? What do you really want?\nWALTER: My calculations show what you must already know. An enormous amount of energy will be drained from wherever you arrive and a large number of people will be killed.\nALISTAIR PECK: (certain in his concept) But each jump back clears that slate.\nWALTER: No! (certain in his concept) If you are reunited with your fianc\u00e9e and you pull her from that car, the victims of this last massive reset will remain dead.\nALISTAIR PECK: (sits near Walter) Listen. On the day of the crash, we argued. Arlette wanted me to go to some store to register for wedding gifts, and I hurt her feelings and I left. As I walked, I became drawn to something on the horizon. A large, red ball. It was a hot air balloon. Moored on the city's outskirts, out in this field. I spent the whole day in this field, looking at this balloon, and I got my answer. I had an epiphany of how to physically apply my theories of time travel. I was in that field the moment her car was hit. 18 May, 2:18 P.M. If I'd have simply done what she asked me, if I'd have said, 'sure, I'll go with you', I know it wouldn't have happened. I will jump back. But I'll jump back into that empty field, Walter. And I'll only drain the energy from the plant life. Energy will be dispersed, no one will die, and I will pull Arlette from that car and I will save her life.\nWALTER: I know why you haven't gone back to May 18th, yet. Because you don't know how to. You haven't been able to jump back any further than the train. (stands and disconnects his covert microphone)\nBROYLES: (still in car. hears static) What happened? (on tactical radio) Someone get that signal back on-line!\nWALTER: You approximate the time curvature using a seventh order polynomial. But you made one small error. For the distance you require, it should be at least nine. I've read you too.\nRADIO TECH: (over radio) We can't get him back on-line. He turned the radio off.\nBROYLES: (reply on radio) Get a team up there, now.\nWALTER: I'm telling you how to do this, but I'm telling you - you cannot do it.\nALISTAIR PECK: I must do it.\nWALTER: You'll never be able to live with the consequences.\nALISTAIR PECK: I told you, no one will die.\nWALTER: (standing. resolute) That's not the consequences I'm talking about. I, too, attempted the unimaginable, and I succeeded. I crossed into another universe, and took a son that wasn't mine. And since then, not a day has passed without me feeling the burden of that act. (sits) I'm going to tell you something that I have never told another soul. (tactical squad charges into the building and down the corridor) Until I took my son from the other side, I had never believed in God. But it occurred to me... that my actions had betrayed him and that everything that had happened to me since was God punishing me. So now I'm looking for a sign of forgiveness. I've asked God for a sign of forgiveness. A specific one, a white tulip.\nALISTAIR PECK: Tulips don't bloom this time of year -- white or otherwise.\nWALTER: But he's God. And if God can forgive me for my acts then maybe... it's in the realm of possibility that my son, possibly, may be able to forgive me too.\nALISTAIR PECK: (certain) Walter, God is science. God is polio and flu vaccines and M.R.I. machines, and artificial hearts. If you are a man of science, then that's the only faith we need. (assault team closes-in)\nWALTER: Then allow me to serve as a precautionary tale. There will be repercussions if you pull Arlette from that car. You don't know how things will be changed by your actions, but they will. It's not our place to adjust the universe. And you will never be able to look at her again without knowing that, just like every time I look at my son. I have traveled through madness to figure this out. And you will too.\nALISTAIR PECK: You're asking me to just leave her there.\nWALTER: (as the team arrives to capture Peck) No, no, no! Stop! I'm alright. (runs to halt the team) Stop! No, please! Gentlemen, please! Don't you see? We won't remember this. Don't you see? We won't remember anything. (Peck initiates temporal travel and disappears) We won't remember!\nUNIFORM COP: (on tactical radio as he inspects corpses strewn about) Officer in need of back-up\nRADIO DISPATCHER: (replying) Copy that. What's your twenty?\nUNIFORM COP: I am at 4-1-2 Inman Street. (inside, Peck continues to re-figure his math equations)\nASTRID: (studying her monitor in the lab as the team gathers around her) This is weird. I did a search for Peck's cell phone when we first I.D.'d him as a suspect. He didn't have one. But Arlette Turling's number is still active. Now in the past twenty hours, the primary cell tower that's been handling the signal is a tower near... Albany Street.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: (from Inman Street as the tactical squad arrives) Alistair Peck is back at his residence. Six dead, including two Boston P.D. Officers. We have to take him down before he jumps again.\n(the science teams arrives and joins the fracas. Peck watches from his second-story lab as law enforcement prepares to enter the building. Peck puts on his glasses and coat, then sits to draw a quick message and address it. The tactical team batters at the locked door to gain entry. sharpshooters are positioning)\nTACTICAL SNIPER: (on radio) I've got the shot.\nBROYLES: Take it.\n(Peck finishes the letter, then notices in the mirror that a laser designator is targeting his head. he ducks to the floor and is barely missed by the snipers bullet. downstairs, the assault team breaks the door open and charges upstairs. before they can reach Peck, he activates his temporal pocket and travels to the park with the hot air balloon. he dashes from the field and down to the street where his fianc\u00e9e is parked. he arrives just as she is preparing to drive away. both happy that he decided to join her on the shopping trip, he tells her he loves her as he holds her hand. seconds later, a speeding vehicle crashes broadside into the engaged couple)\n(in her office Professor Bryce takes the letter Peck composed from a hanging file drawer and studies the addressee)\nPROFESSOR LIME: (joining her after passing her open door) I haven't seen you look at that letter for a while. It's been almost a year since Alistair died.\nCAROL BRYCE: Today's the day I'm supposed to send it.\nPROFESSOR LIME: Open it. Apparently, Alistair felt whatever it is, he could put in your trust.\nCAROL BRYCE: He wouldn't have sealed it if he wanted me to see what's inside. (she places the letter on her desk - unopened)\n(Walter sits, writing his letter to Peter. somber, he seals it and studies a picture of the two of them, then walks to roaring fireplace and tosses the letter in)\nPETER: (walking through the front door with audio equipment) Walter? Hey, I got you something. Fixed your turntable. I'd tell you to keep it out of the lab this time, but I know you won't.\nWALTER: (heavy-hearted) Thank you, Peter.\nPETER: I thought maybe you'd like some music to cheer you up. Walter, I know that you've been in a funk for the last couple of weeks. If there's something you want to talk to me about --\nWALTER: No. Something was weighing on me, a decision, but... I'm fine.\nPETER: Okay. I'm gonna go hit the hay (heads-off to his bedroom).\n(Walter watches the letter he wrote continue to burn. New letters have been delivered to the house and rest on the entryway rug. Walter retrieves them and opens an interesting one. It is a simple, hand-drawn image of a tulip on white paper... the sign he was looking for)"

Give me that. (a window above them shatters in the warehouse they are parked next to. glass falls onto the car) I thought you said this place was abandoned.\nDAVE: I'm gonna check it out.\nJILL REDMOND: We should just go.\nDAVE: No, just hang tight. I'll be fine. (enters the building. looks around. finds a quivering egg-shaped mass on the floor) What the hell? (pokes it. turns when startled. neck snapped by a bi-pedal humanoid with no features. has roof of mouth punctured with device used to copy his physical features. featureless humanoid morphs into \"Dave\")\nJILL REDMOND: (after waiting in the car for awhile. friend returns from the warerhouse and gets in car with her) This totally sucks. What took you so long? You scared the hell out of me. I want to leave here, Dave. (screams as a second featureless humanoid exits the building and heads toward the car to help attack her)\nPETER: (comes in the front door) Oh, come on, Walter, not again.\nWALTER: I'm just rearranging. Uh, it's not quite right yet.\nPETER: It's fine. And it was fine yesterday and fine the day before that.\nWALTER: A well-ordered house is -- is the sign of a well-ordered mind.\nPETER: Yeah, but staying up all night to find the perfect place for your laundry hamper is a sign of something else, in my books. Come on, leave that for later. I got you a surprise. I thought maybe we could bake a pie together. Your favorite -- say, pecan? I got all the good stuff. You want to whip the batter?\nWALTER: The batter can wait. There's something we have to talk about.\nPETER: Okay, fair enough. It's your room. You can decorate it however you like.\nWALTER: It's not that. There's something you deserve to know. Peter... every living thing dies. As a scientist, that's one of the hardest things to accept, that -- that we try to understand the mechanisms of life, but inevitably, we can't defeat death, no matter how much we -- we may want to.\nPETER: (looks at phone) It's Olivia. (answers) Hey. What's up? (listens) Yeah. (listens) Yeah, sure. We'll meet you outside. (hangs-up)\nWALTER: Something happened?\nPETER: Yeah, I guess so. She's on her way to pick us up.\nWALTER: I'll -- I'll get my field kit.\nPETER: Walter...\nWALTER: ...oh, it's -- it's -- it's alright, Peter. It can wait.\nBROYLES: (briefing the team near the parked vehicle) Name's Jill Redmond. Her purse was found outside the car. Patrolman found her with a broken neck. That's the cause of death. But the Medical Examiner found this... three puncture wounds in her soft palate. Raised a red flag in the FBI Database and came up the chain to me.\nOLIVIA: Shape-shifters. Well, the last time we heard of Newton and his men was in New York.\nPETER: They must have needed her identity for something.\nOLIVIA: What else do we know about her?\nBROYLES: We're running a background check on her now.\nOLIVIA: Well, we should send her photograph to the local and state law enforcement and make sure they know that she just got a hell of a lot more dangerous than she looks.\nWALTER: (looks at a hand-rolled cigarette) Look... it's a Lemon Zinger, I believe. (smells it) Mm! It's not as good as the stuff I grow, but it's not bad either.\nPETER: Well, at least she died in a happy place.\nOLIVIA: I'm not so sure. The girl's wearing lipstick, but there isn't any on the joint.\nPETER: So you think that maybe she was with somebody?\nOLIVIA: Maybe... maybe someone who was lucky enough to get away.\nWALTER: (later, as the team searches inside the warehouse, over the body of Dave) Three puncture wounds to the soft palate.\nAGENT: (after inspecting the area) All clear. The rest of the place is deserted.\nPETER: (removes cardboard covering a large, translucent egg-shaped object) Except for this.\nOLIVIA: Walter, have you seen anything like this before?\nWALTER: I think I may have. It's awfully familiar. Ah, yes. It reminds me of a beanbag chair I once owned... 1974.\nOLIVIA: So when a shape-shifter takes a body, it's because they want access, like, uh, the one that -- that turned into the nurse, came after me at the hospital, or, uh... or Charlie.\nPETER: So what would the shape-shifters want with these kids?\nBROYLES: (as Walter starts to cut into the object) You think that's a good idea?\nWALTER: Oh, yeah, I think it's harmless enough. (cuts in. looks at his glove) Mercury.\nOLIVIA: Walter, if that's mercury, do you think that this is a shape-shifter?\nWALTER: I do believe it is. (reaches in and removes shape changing device) Isn't that wonderful?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Good morning.\nDAVE (SHIFTER): We're here to pick up a camera, an Argus... A2B-35 millimeter.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: The Secretary told me there would be three of you.\nJILL REDMOND (SHIFTER): There was a problem. The third didn't make it.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Marvelous.\nWALTER: That feels like an embryo, in the sense that it's not fully developed.\nASTRID: Developed?\nWALTER: Well, my theory is that this is the state in which they enter our universe. And as I've said, being partly mechanical, they can cross over in a way that humans can't. But, uh, this one... seems to have failed to mature properly. Peter, would you take a look?\nPETER: Shape-shifter embryo. Adorable.\nOLIVIA: So the two teenagers... maybe there were two more of these that hatched and killed them.\nWALTER: It's a sound proposition, but presumably the embryonic shape-shifters would have needed features, human identities. They certainly wouldn't blend in otherwise.\nPETER: So then those two teenagers were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nWALTER: It's got dozens of different amino acids, which would allow it to survive in the foreign conditions of our universe.\nOLIVIA: Okay, that was Broyles. Astrid, I want to see if we can download this file from the FBI's secure server.\nTV NARRATOR: (later, on screen in front of science team) The african elephant is the largest --\nOLIVIA: Okay, this was recorded last night. Now just before 9:00 P.M., several dozen homes, all within a half-mile radius of the warehouse, reported an -- an odd kind of interference with their broadcast signal.\nPETER: That's right around when the M.E. estimated the time of death for those kids.\nOLIVIA: Walter, is it possible that the shape-shifter embryo could have caused this kind of interference?\nWALTER: Yes. I believe the interfering signal may have originated in the alternate universe. We may be getting a glimpse into the other side.\nOLIVIA: Can we turn it up?\nASTRID: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: And slow it down. (listening to the broadcast) What is that?\nASTRID: It almost sounds like a language. You hear the way that some of those sounds seem to repeat?\nPETER: Shape-shifters are soldiers. Soldiers always come with orders. Maybe that's a message.\nASTRID: I can see what the code breakers at the bureau can make of it.\nOLIVIA: I got a better idea.\nBRANDON: It's not a language. It's math.\nOLIVIA: Math?\nBRANDON: Trig and metric equations -- in this case, a radio wave, the kind given off by a solar flare, which is interesting.\nOLIVIA: Interesting how?\nBRANDON: Our astronomical division picked up a surge in solar activity right around that time. Here's a radio wave from last night's solar flare. Uh, here's your wave. But yours couldn't have come from the Sun.\nOLIVIA: Well, where else could it have come from?\nBRANDON: I don't know. I mean, they're not in sync.\nOLIVIA: Suppose it came from a parallel universe.\nBRANDON: Wow. That -- that would de -- Yeah, yeah, because in a parallel universe, time would be slightly out of sync.\nPETER: And the waves would be too.\nBRANDON: Hmm.\nPETER: What?\nBRANDON: Imagine that these are the two universes... slightly out of sync. But on rare occasion, they perfectly line up. According to the computer, that's gonna happen between our universe and wherever this radio wave came from.\nOLIVIA: When?\nBRANDON: Based on this, tomorrow at precisely 3:31 P.M.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Alright, who will be McCallister?\nJILL REDMOND (SHIFTER): That'd be me. He's Wu. (reviewing victim file)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Now everything else you need is in here. Once you're done, we'll reconvene at the exchange points tomorrow at exactly twenty past three.\nJILL REDMOND (SHIFTER): So that's it? We're still going through with this?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Why? You have a problem with this?\nJILL REDMOND (SHIFTER): We're a man down. Neither of us have time to handle the Verona Assignment, and you don't have a shifting device. Maybe we should abort.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: And I suppose you'll be the one to give the news to The Secretary. We won't have another chance like this for seven months. So I'll figure out how to handle Mister Verona. You make sure you hold your end. Alright?\nJILL REDMOND (SHIFTER): You're the boss.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Then let's get to work.\nJILL REDMOND (SHIFTER): (approaching politely as the banker unlocks his car) Excuse me. Would you happen to know where Franklin street is?\nBEN McCALLISTER: Sure. Uh, you're three blocks South of Franklin, so go down this street. You'll see a convenience store. Then make a left and go two blocks West. (prepares to give better directions) I'll write it down for you.\nPETER: Hey. Where's Walter?\nASTRID: (chopping on the counter) He's out counting cars. Thinks it might help jog his memory. He says that human memory is best triggered...\nPETER: ...when accomplishing mundane tasks, I know.\nASTRID: Yeah, Walter's convinced that Newton wants to build a door to the other side. If Walter can remember what he told Newton, we might be able to figure out what's supposed to happen at 3:31 tomorrow.\nPETER: And these cars that he's tracking down?\nASTRID: Well, he promised to stay off the freeway.\nPETER: (enters side office) Hey.\nOLIVIA: (busy. sitting in front of paperwork) Hey.\nPETER: How goes it?\nOLIVIA: Uh, Broyles sent over a list of state and local events taking place tomorrow, so... (hands over list)\nPETER: (reading list. sits) Uh-oh. Star Trek Convention at the Worcester Centrum. That's not good. I told Walter I'd take him. Maybe we'll just pretend like we didn't see that.\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nPETER: I think I finally figured out why it is that Walter's been acting so strange lately. He's been carrying this picture around with him -- a family photo from when I was a kid. I think he wants to talk to me about how my mother died. About a month after I got to Europe, I got a call from Saint Claire's... from Walter. He told me that she died in a car crash. It wasn't a car crash. My mother committed suicide. It was the only time I spoke to him in the seventeen years that he was locked up in Saint Claire's. He must have known the truth. I think, in his way, he was trying to protect me. And... and for whatever reason, he wants to talk about it now.\nOLIVIA: Peter... you know that Walter loves you very much.\nWALTER: (returning from outside) Peter! Our synthetic friends. I believe I know how to figure out what they're up to.\nOLIVIA: You remember what you told Newton?\nWALTER: No, but as they say in Finland...\nASTRID\/WALTER: ...there's more than one way to roast a reindeer.\nWALTER: But I'll need some supplies. I need six car batteries, a voltage transformer, and -- and several yards of ten-gauge electrical wire. Oh! Uh, and a corpse. Any corpse will do. But it shouldn't be dead for more than two days.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (approaches counter) Hello.\nBANK TELLER: Hello. Can I help you?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Yes, I'm here to see your manager, Mister McCallister. He's... he's expecting me.\nBEN McCALLISTER (SHIFTER): (on stairwell) So, boss, you felt the need to check up on me?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Yeah.\nBEN McCALLISTER (SHIFTER): Figure out what to do about Verona?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I have some thoughts.\nBANK TELLER: (interrupts the two in the deposit vault as they prepare to plant the device) Mister McCallister?\nBEN McCALLISTER (SHIFTER): Yes?\nBANK TELLER: Approval for an overdraft withdrawal?\nBEN McCALLISTER (SHIFTER): Oh, thank you. I'll be there in just a minute.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Okay. You can handle the rest. Just make sure the device remains undisturbed. (hands over the device)\nPETER: Tied into the house power, and the volt meter is ready to go.\nOLIVIA: Uh, so, Walter, you're sure that I'm doing this right?\nWALTER: It's perfect, Olivia. Just make sure they're tightened down.\nASTRID: Walter, you really think that his is gonna work?\nWALTER: There's no reason it shouldn't. I mean, something stopped this creature from developing, and because it's part mechanical, if we pump it with enough electricity, we should be able to restart it, like jump-starting a car.\nASTRID: So what's the corpse for? Is this embryo supposed to reanimate it?\nWALTER: Oh, don't be ridiculous. B - but, if we intend to question this creature, then it will need an identity to... to shape-shift into.\nPETER: 'cause that's not ridiculous at all.\nWALTER: I think we're ready, Olivia. 80 amps.\nPETER: 80 amps.\nWALTER: Hmm, not enough power, but it seems to be working. Uh, try 110.\nPETER: uhh... 110.\nWALTER: Uh, 140.\nPETER: uhh... 140. I think we must have blown a fuse.\nWALTER: Oh, my. Look. Astrid, quickly -- some candles. (writhes to life in agony) Something's wrong. When I cut into it, I must have damaged it. Peter, the corpse.\nPETER: Alright, good on my side. (hooks shape changing device into fresh corpse)\nEMBRYONIC SHIFTER: (bolts to life) Help me. Contact... Newton.\nOLIVIA: Thomas Jerome Newton? Where is he?\nEMBRYONIC SHIFTER: Verona. d-d-Daniel... Verona.\nOLIVIA: Wait, who is Daniel Verona?\nEMBRYONIC SHIFTER: Blood type A.B. Negative. Cellular polarity...\nWALTER: ...we're losing him.\nOLIVIA: Okay, tomorrow afternoon, what is happening at 3:31?\nEMBRYONIC SHIFTER: I'm... sorry. (dies)\nOLIVIA: (intercepting him outside of the grocery store) Daniel Verona? FBI.\nEMERGENCY DISPATCHER: (answering a call from a phone booth) 9-1-1. What is your emergency?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Well, there's a man. He's middle-aged, Caucasian. It looks like he's having a heart attack.\nEMERGENCY DISPATCHER: What is your location?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I'm on the corner of Longwood and Huntington.\nEMERGENCY DISPATCHER: What is your name, sir?\nPASSERBY #1: (after Newton hangs-up and takes a pill that causes him to collapse and convulse) Oh, my God! Hey, this... this guy needs help! Does anyone know C.P.R.? Someone call an ambulance, quick!\nOLIVIA: He's not a shape-shifter.\nBROYLES: We'll run his blood anyway, test it for mercury. Maybe we got to him before they could.\nOLIVIA: Why him? I mean, why Daniel Verona? What could they want with him?\nBROYLES: Medical Examiner, works out of Boston General... it's anybody's guess.\nPETER: Yeah, you too. Okay. Good night.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham?\nPETER: Yeah. Verona was a bust. Walter... you've been awake for two straight days. You need to get some rest.\nWALTER: Shape-shifters... I should have been more careful with my initial dissection. If I hadn't caused so much damage, it would... it could have told us everything.\nPETER: But you couldn't possibly have known that.\nWALTER: It was definitely stupid and inexcusable.\nPETER: Calm down. It's gonna be okay. Okay, yeah. We're gonna figure it out, just like we always do. Okay. Okay. Okay?\nWALTER: Hmm.\nPETER: I want you to get some rest, Dad. I'm gonna hit the sack. I'll be upstairs if you need me.\nWALTER: Dad.\nPETER: Huh?\nWALTER: You just called me Dad.\nPETER: Yeah, I guess I did.\nWALTER: Peter!\nPETER: Yeah?\nWALTER: Newton... I think I know what he's planning to do.\nPETER: She's here.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham, I'm --I'm sorry to get you out of bed.\nOLIVIA: Oh, it's okay.\nWALTER: Okay. Now... Geometry and harmonic vibrations. That's how we did it, Belly and I.\nOLIVIA: Did what?\nWALTER: Sent Belly's Monte Carlo from this universe to the other side. Now as I've said before, the two universes vibrate at different frequencies. So we set up three harmonic rods arranged as an equilateral triangle and then activated the rods. When the car began to vibrate at just the right frequency... that's how we sent Belly's car to the other side.\nPETER: And it's exactly what Newton did with the building.\nOLIVIA: But Newton's attempt failed.\nWALTER: Yes, indeed it did, b-because the building that Newton brought over landed in a location that was already occupied by another. But I suspect that Mister Newton has found a way around that problem, because he has something that Belly and I never had.\nOLIVIA: What's that?\nPETER: Agents in both universes.\nWALTER: Yes, Peter. So if we set up the harmonic rods in exactly the same position in each universe, like so... and we activate the rods... boom. Then whatever is in the center of each triangle will simply be exchanged. Of course, that would likely require that the universes be in sync.\nOLIVIA: 3:31 this afternoon. Okay, so, uh... so what could Newton bring here?\nWALTER: Last time he brought a building, so I suppose anything he could fit inside of it -- a... a machine.\nPETER: An army.\nWALTER: Yes. If the triangle is large enough, that is possible.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so we have roughly ten hours to figure out where the center of Newton's triangle is.\nWALTER: Yes. But it could be anywhere.\n(the shape-shifter, as Lineman Wu, is up a powerpole and planting the third harmonic device well away from Boston on the far side of the Charles River. Wu's supervisor is trying to contact him)\nUTILITY SUPERVISOR: (over the radio) Wu! You're supposed to be fixing a transformer at Third and Spencer. Where the hell are you?\nWALTER: (in his lab with the team, he rolls out an area map) Three points -- Newton would have to place the harmonic rods at three specific locations across the city.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so that's why Newton's going after Verona, because Verona must have access to one of the three points.\nPETER: So that would suggest either Boston General Hospital or Verona's home.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so Verona lives in Beacon Hill -- 520 South Garden Street.\nPETER: (drawing on map) It doesn't matter. It's only a couple blocks from the hospital. So for our purposes, that's our first point.\nASTRID: (entering room reading from a sheet of paper) I think I might be able to help. Boston P.D. just found a corpse in Chestnut Hill Village. Three punctures to his soft palate. His name is Ben McCallister. He's a branch manager at Pinewood Savings Bank. He was found just outside his office.\nWALTER: Not easy to access a bank.\nOLIVIA: Okay, 185 Mason Avenue\nPETER: (plotting the point) Mason... so that's our second point, and now we have the first leg of our triangle.\nWALTER: We've got more than that, son. We're looking for an equilateral triangle, therefore, the third point...\nPETER: ...can only be in one of two places, right. (plots two equilateral triangle from the commmon side) Alright, so the third point is either Arlington or... Cedar Grove.\nWALTER: Well, try both. See what's in the center of each triangle.\nPETER: (plots the two center points) It's either Hyde Park... or right on the Charles River. So he's got to be targeting Hyde Park.\nOLIVIA: Is there a bridge on the Charles?\nPETER: Yeah, a condemned railway bridge. Why?\nOLIVIA: Uh, the water would absorb any excess energy caused by Newton's procedure, so he must be making the exchange on the bridge.\nWALTER: She's right, Peter.\nOLIVIA: (calls out on cell phone) Uh, it's Dunham. I think we have something.\n(Newton stands riverside and studies the empty gap between the two main support towers of the bridge. his two shape shifting soldiers approach)\nDAVID WU: We're all set.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Any problems?\nDAVID WU: All good.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (after a police vehicle on the opposite side of the bridge pulls-up and sounds a warning alarm. to his two shape-shifters) Go deal with it, now. (the two leave)\nOLIVIA: (racing to the scene, on the phone in her car) Are we sending anyone to look for the harmonic rods?\nBROYLES: (hurrying through the parking garage to his vehicle with additional agents) Agents are on their way to the morgue and McCallister's bank in Chestnut Hill. Boston P.D. have been deployed to the Andrews Avenue Bridge. What's your status?\nOLIVIA: We're a few minutes away. Whatever Newton's trying to bring over, Walter thinks he can stop it.\nBROYLES: Okay, call me when you get there. (hangs-up)\nPETER: (in the car with Olivia, turns toward the back seat) Walter, how is this thing gonna work?\nWALTER: Vibrations are composed of shock waves, and like sound waves, they can be nullified by their opposite --\nPETER: Right, like noise-cancelling headphones.\nWALTER: Precisely. The seismograph will pick up the vibrations from Newton's device. The laptop will calculate its opposite and transmit it to the pneumatic hammer.\nPETER: To send out vibrations that would cancel out Newton's device.\nWALTER: (busy preparing the equipment) Of course, we have to get the hammer as close to the center of the bridge as possible, which might be dangerous.\nOLIVIA: Dangerous how?\nWALTER: The vibrational waves that Newton will need to generate the intensity -- devastating.\nPETER: What do you mean, \"devastating\"?\nWALTER: I suspect it would tear a man apart.\nPETER: (after arriving at the bridge, the team exits the vehicle and starts to walk toward the two police officers on duty protectng the entrance to the bridge) Walter, I need you to stay here and finish putting that thing together, okay? (approaches the two 'officers') Hey... we need to get on that bridge.\nCOP #1: I'm afraid that's not possible.\nOLIVIA: (approaches behind Peter and flashes her badge) Uh... I'm with the FBI.\nCOP #1: You're the boss. Let me just check with the Sergeant. (takes out cell phone and starts to dial. Olivia quickly shoots the second officer in the head. it oozes mercury from the skull. )\nPETER: (as they both duck for cover behind the police cruiser) How did you know?\nOLIVIA: A cop wouldn't call his sergeant on a cell phone. (COP #1 runs for cover. Olivia and the shape-shifter exchange fire, reload and continue a gun battle. Walter watches from Olivia's utility vehicle loaded with his equipment)\nPETER: (Walter starts the FBI vehicle and races ahead through the gun battle towards the edge of the bridge) Walter! No!\n(Peter is caught in the crossfire and stays behind cover. Walter makes it through the gun battle unharmed and to the edge of the condemned Andrews Avenue Bridge. Newton sees Walter arriving, checks his watch and returns to his monitor to see what progress has been happening in aligning the harmonics between the two uiniverses. the harmonic rods at the bank, morgue and powerpole are all beginning to glow brighter. The bridge under Walter starts to shake roughly)\n(Newton monitors his equipment on his side of the river as Walter works to set-up his across the river. Peter and Olivia are still pinned behind the police cruiser)\nOLIVIA: It's 3:32. Walter's not gonna make it in time.\nPETER: (leaves safety behind the car and starts a dash toward the bridge) I'm going up there. Cover me. (Olivia fires at the shape-shifting policeman and runs after Peter)\n(Peter arrives at their vehicle at the end of the bridge and starts to unload the equipment with Walter)\nPETER: Hey.\nWALTER: (demanding) Peter, you need to get off this bridge. I have to put this right. I started this, I've got to...\nPETER: ...It's gonna go faster if we do it together.\n(Newton watches the Bishops race to defeat his procedure and makes a cell phone call. Olivia continues her gun battle with the remaining shape-shifter)\nCOP #1: (answers call from Newton) What?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Yeah, the two on the bridge -- get them out of there.\nOLIVIA: (the shape-shifter starts to run to the bridge and is shot dead by Olivia. Broyles arrives with extra agents and the run to assist. to Broyles) Peter and Walter are on the bridge. It's started.\nWALTER: (preparing the equipment) Pneumatic is ready.\nPETER: Seismograph is ready. (as a major vibration shakes the structure)\nWALTER: (looking at laptop computer) Cleaning up the program! (heavy-duty compacter begins pounding the decking) Something's wrong! (inspects the compacter as Peter moves to the laptop) I don't understand. It should be working.\nPETER: There's something wrong with your frequency-recognition program. But don't worry. I can fix it.\nOLIVIA: (approaches with agents) How we doing?\nPETER: I need you all to get off this bridge now.\nWALTER: Get off the bridge.\nPETER: No, Walter, there's nothing else you can do. (to Olivia) I need you to get him off this bridge.\nOLIVIA: Come on, Walter.\nWALTER: No, Olivia. (resisting)\nOLIVIA: Walter -- Walter -- (as everyone leaves Peter and a single FBI agent alone on the bridge)\n(more vibrations shake the area as Newton checks his monitor. a shimmering vision of the bridge in the alternate universe appears. Peter fights to get the program working, then finds and repairs a loose connector. he looks out on the forming bridge and sees the faint image of a man standing in the middle. the agent sees the man from the other universe and draws and aims his weapon)\nPETER: (as piercing noise hurts his head and ears) Aah! (to the agent) You okay? (as the agent dissolves into thin air. the faint image walks away from Peter and reaches Newton's side of the river just as Walter's countermeasure disrupts the bridge from forming, returning it to the alternate universe. the shockwave sends Peter flying backward against the grill of his own vehicle. Peter loses consciousness)\nOLIVIA: (hauntingly, as Peter's groggily opens his eyes) Welcome back.\nPETER: (sitting-up in bed. gaining his senses) How long was I out?\nOLIVIA: Uh, about a day and a half. Here. (offers him some ice to eat) The doctor said that you'd be fine, but Walter was worried.\nPETER: I'm fine. Is he here?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. He wouldn't leave. He'll want to know that you're up. (starts out to retrieve Walter)\nPETER: Olivia... I'd like to speak to him alone, if that's okay.\nOLIVIA: Sure. (continues out of the room)\nWALTER: (joyous. enters perky) Peter. Oh, they told me you'd be alright, But I was so worried, son, and...\nPETER: There was another man on that bridge. When Newton's device started to work, I saw him there... just walking down the bridge. He had to have been from the other side. You said the effects of Newton's vibrations would be devastating, and... they were. They destroyed that FBI agent. They just... disintegrated him like he wasn't even there. But they didn't kill the man from the other side. And they didn't kill me. (stares deep into Walter's eyes) I'm not from here, am I? You didn't just open up a hole to the other side. You went through... and you brought me back. That's why I was able to survive Newton's device. It's why I can't remember my childhood.\nWALTER: You were dying, Peter..\nPETER: ...It's why my mother committed suicide. Isn't it? She knew... didn't she? And when I left, the guilt was too much for her to live with -- the lie.\nWALTER: Peter, you need to understand something...\nPETER: (growing angrier) ...I understand, Walter. I understand everything now.\nWALTER: (atoning) Son...\nPETER: (mad) I am not your son. I'd like to be alone now.\n(Walter trundles out, then looks back through a window from the corridor)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Uh, it -- it would be easier if you don't try to talk just yet, Mister Secretary. (prepares a syringe) You see, despite the preparation, crossing over is quite an ordeal on your body, and, uh, the consequences are unpredictable. This... (administers the syringe) this should help. You should... you should be able to sleep for a while. And hopefully, when you wake up, you'll be stabilized. (the man from the other side takes Newton's hand firmly. Newton nods at their shared success)\nASTRID: (joins the doctor as he prepares food to deliver to the hospital) Walter, it's six o'clock. Peter's probably still sleeping.\nWALTER: (sternly) I have to go to the hospital now. Are you going to drive me, or shall I call a cab?\nOLIVIA: (to Astrid after she is let in the front door) Hey. (approaches quietly) Walter... Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago. He isn't at the Lab, and he's not answering his phone. He's gone."

It's -- it's a hybrid. Of Chronic Supernova and Afghani Kush. I call it Brown Betty.\nASTRID: (tolerant) Walter... I know how you're feeling.\nWALTER: It's important to take control of one's life.\nASTRID: Walter.\nWALTER: Eh.\nASTRID: Peter is going to come back. He just needs some time. But he will come back.\nWALTER: (as Olivia marches in through the lab doors) Oh!\nASTRID: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nWALTER: Is there news? Have you found him?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, Walter. I have some leads that I would like to follow up, but I have to --\nWALTER: -- You have to what? What can be more important than finding Peter?\nELLA: (enters the lab) Aunt Liv... the snack machine stole the dollar you gave me. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Uncle Walter.\nASTRID: Hi, Ella. You know what? We have some snacks back there in the fridge. You can go help yourself.\nELLA: Thanks.\nASTRID: Mm-hmm.\nWALTER: Who's that?\nASTRID: Ella, Walter.\nELLA: (marching off) It smells funny in here.\nASTRID: Rachel's daughter. Rachel's Olivia's sister.\nOLIVIA: Rachel had to go to Chicago for the weekend, so she asked if I could look after Ella. And I was wondering if maybe you could watch her --\nWALTER: Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't possibly look after anyone else. I'm well into Phase One.\nASTRID: I think she's talking about me. Walter just smoked something called Brown Betty.\nELLA: Hi, cow. (meets Gene)\nWALTER: Be careful, Stella. (runs to intercept the two) Gene, Gene, no licking. no licking.\nOLIVIA: You should only have to watch her for a few hours.\nASTRID: Don't worry, Olivia. I will be here. We would love to have her.\nELLA: (playing the board game - Operation. to Walter as the buzzer repeatedly sounds) You're killing him. You're not supposed to touch the sides. What kind of doctor are you? You're not even trying.\nWALTER: His heart.\nELLA: All you've done is eat all my snacks and talk about weird stuff and everything makes you laugh. I know! Why don't you tell me a story?\nWALTER: I'm not very good at stories.\nELLA: Didn't you used to tell stories to Peter?\nWALTER: Mm. I'm sure Missus. Bishop did, but... no, I never told Peter stories. I was always... too busy with my work.\nELLA: What about your parents, Uncle Walter? Didn't they tell you stories?\nWALTER: Oh, yes. My mother loved Chandler and another writer called Dashiell Hammett. She loved detective stories. Oh! And musicals! She adored musicals! She often would dress me up to play parts in plays at school. I was roughed up quite a lot as a child.\nASTRID: Walter... I think that Ella would really, really enjoy a story.\nELLA: Once upon a time.\nWALTER: Well, alright. Are you ready? Um, hmm. Once upon a time... there was an accomplished detective. Except that she had decided to retire, pack it in, because there was one mystery she could not solve.\nELLA: What was that?\nWALTER: How to mend a broken heart. (as fictional Olivia looks at a picture of fictional John Scott)\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: Miss Dunham? My name is Rachel. I'm sorry to just show up like this, but I have left you several messages, and I'd like to hire you. My boyfriend, he's gone missing.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Well, as you can see, I'm kinda busy. (pours her self a drink)\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: He got in over his head to a gambler. A guy named Big Eddie. I'm afraid something bad may have happened to him.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Drown him?\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: I'm sorry, what? (declines the drink offer) Oh, uh, no, thank you.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: You know, most times when someone comes in here worried that their sweetheart's gone missing, or worse... by the time they find out what I usually find out, they wind up wishing he really were dead.\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: What do you usually find out?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Rachel, is it? Do yourself a favor. Go home.\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: He wouldn't do what you're suggesting. We met only a few weeks ago, but... it was love at first sight. You probably don't believe something like that exists. But I assure you - it does.\nWALTER: (his mind wanders from the fable he was narrating to Ella and he starts singing) Something happens and I'm head over heels. I never find out till I'm head over heels. Something happens and I'm head over heels. Don't take my heart, don't break my heart... don't, don't, don't throw it away.\nASTRID: (honestly) What those school kids must've done to you.\nELLA: (earnestly) Maybe you should teach me algebra.\nWALTER: Oh. Oh, you see, (fibbing) the... medication that Uncle Walter is on, causes his posterior and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles to contract his larynx's. Anyway, what was I saying? Ah! Yes. True love. (returns to his story)\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: When was the last time you spoke to him?\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: On the telephone two days ago.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay, and what's his name?\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: Peter Bishop.\nELLA: (interrupts the story) Wait a minute. That's wrong. My mom doesn't love Peter.\nWALTER: Of course not. It's just a story. But, as with all good stories, things aren't always as they seem. So where were we?\nELLA: She just took the case.\nWALTER: Oh, yes. How could she not? See, what Rachel didn't know is that Detective Olivia once believed in love. Especially great love. And, if for no other reason, she took this case to see if such a love really existed. Now, this is where things might get a bit frightening. I'm not sure you'd want me to go on.\nELLA: (eagerly) Does it have to do with Peter?\nWALTER: Maybe. It just might. You see, just as Olivia was gathering the facts from Rachel, far on the other side of town, a young man had gone into hiding because he had in his possession a very special item.\nELLA: What kind of item?\nWALTER: As it happens... (fictional Peter opens a box and...) A heart. But a heart unlike anything the world had ever seen.\nWALTER: Now... the measure of a good detective is where she gets her information from.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (to bar patron) Is he here?\nWALTER: (voiceover) Detective Dunham knew some high people in low places.\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: (sits at piano, playing and singing, Olivia approaches) ...and you just can't escape from the sound... don't worry too much, it'll happen to you... we were children once playing with toys... (stops. annoyed)\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Hello, Lieutenant Broyles. Good to see you. What's the matter? You're not gonna say hello?\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: Well, now, I didn't know if you actually meant hello or if you were just stringing me along. You're good at that.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: I need to ask a favor.\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: Must be a good one if you're coming to me.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Not as good a favor as pretending six years ago I didn't see a cop on the beat plant evidence to get a promotion. But yeah, it's important.\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: What is it?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (hands over photo of fictional Peter) Missing person.\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: Never seen him. (hands photo back)\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What about this? (hands over geometric doodle) Does it mean anything to you? That guy's sweetheart found it in her apartment the night he vanished.\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: (studies it) It's a company logo. Massive Dynamic. Ever heard of them?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: No. What do they do?\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: Question is, what don't they do?\nWALTER: (voicing over as Broyles plays the piano) Indeed, what don't they do? Olivia did her homework and soon found out some of the things they did do.\nELLA: (voiceover) Like what?\nWALTER: Massive Dynamic made its money at any cost. A vile firm that never missed an opportunity to exploit the little guy. Profiteering off the creativity of others.\nFICTIONAL NINA: Miss Dunham... Nina Sharp. Pleasure to meet you.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Thank you so much for seeing me.\nFICTIONAL NINA: Detective Broyles called on your behalf. He said you were looking for someone? You thought I may be able to provide some information?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Uh, yes. His name is Peter Bishop. I'm investigating his disappearance on behalf of his fianc\u00e9e. She believes he may be in trouble.\nFICTIONAL NINA: Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me. Whatever trouble he's in, I'm sure he deserves much worse. Peter Bishop is a con man with many talents and many identities -- all of them suspect. Small cons to large scale industrial espionage, with only one person's interests at heart -- his own.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: I see.\nFICTIONAL NINA: But I can tell you one thing. if he's pretending to love this woman, he must be using her somehow. For her sake and yours, I hope he stays missing. He's dangerous. (distracted by her assistant) Ah, I'm sorry. My attention is required on another matter.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Of course. Thank you so much for your time.\nFICTIONAL NINA: Miss Dunham. You should proceed with caution. I meant it when I said that Peter Bishop is dangerous. (on the phone after Olivia leaves) It's me. There has been a development.\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: (her answering machine) Hello, this is Rachel. Please leave a message.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Uh, this is Olivia Dunham. I need to talk to you. It's about Peter Bishop. So could you give me a call as soon as you get this? (hears a scuffle as the line is picked-up) Rachel?\nFICTIONAL RACHEL: Help me, Miss Dunham!\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Rachel! (no reply)\n(fictional Rachel lay dead as the police photographer snaps some still pictures)\nELLA: (interrupts the story) That's not how it goes. She can't be dead.\nWALTER: Why not?\nASTRID: Probably because it's her mother, Walter.\nWALTER: Oh.\nELLA: No, that's not it. Because that's not how stories work. She's in love -- true love. She can't die.\nWALTER: But... as I have said, in this story, things are not as they seem. (continues his tale)\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: She was an actress. Her real name wasn't even Rachel, it was Kelsey. Don't ask me what to make of it, we're in the dark. But whoever did this was good. Didn't leave fingerprints. Hell, we can't even identify what type of weapon he used. But one thing we both know, Dunham -- death seems to follow you around.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What you sayin' there, Chief?\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: I'm saying I want you as far away as possible.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (smart-mouthed) Just when my interest is piqued?\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: Keep nosing around, and you and your interest can spend some time downtown as a guest of The State.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Well, it's three hot meals and a bed. It's tempting, but, uh... I think I'll pass.\nFICTIONAL BROYLES: I'm serious, Dunham. Time to leave things to the Big Boys.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay, you win. (walks out and takes written evidence. drives away and calls on her radio phone)\nFICTIONAL OPERATOR: (answers call) Directory Assistance.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Yes, Operator, I would like an address, please.\nFICTIONAL OPERATOR: Go ahead, Hon. What's the name?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Uh, for Doctor Walter Bishop.\nELLA: (interrupts again as she and Walter feed Gene) It's you.\nWALTER: Kind of. Slightly less handsome than your Uncle Walter. But equally brilliant. A tinkerer, a dreamer. And Olivia would soon discover that he was the one that got her mixed up in all this. (continues story)\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: So you're saying that you hired her to hire me to find Peter Bishop?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: That's right.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Why didn't you come to me yourself?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Ah. Your reputation precedes you, Miss Dunham. You aren't the best, but you're selective. You only take cases where someone has lost their heart to love. So I used her to get your attention. I never meant for her to be harmed.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay, well, you've got my attention now, Doctor Bishop. Now who the hell is Peter Bishop, and why are you looking for him?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: He was my lab assistant.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: You got the same name. You related?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Just coincidental, although I did grow to love Peter as a son. But apparently, he was far more dangerous than I feared. He stole something from me. My most... important invention. I have spent my life making things that bring joy and happiness, to make the world a better place. Bubble Gum was one of my first. Ah. Flannel Pajamas. Oh, Rainbows. And my latest project, Singing Corpses.\nSINGING CORPSES: (three sit-up from their respective tables) Two, three, four... (singing in two parts) Who can take a sunrise? Who can take a sunrise? Sprinkle it with dew? Sprinkle it with dew? Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two? The Candy Man... the Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good. (they cease and recline)\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Why not bring a little life to the dead I say. Their harmonies are still a bit off.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What's this? (points to journal)\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Well, that's a hug, of course.\nELLA: (seeking clarification on the story) He invented hugs?\nWALTER: Oh, yes, my dear. He invented everything that is wonderful in the world. Teddy Bears, and Chocolate Bars, and... oh, and something even more remarkable than that. A heart. (continues the fable)\nFICTIONAL WALTER: A glass heart.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What makes it so special?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Put simply, it's a power source. But it's capable of many wondrous things. And until quite recently... I was kept alive his glass heart. I had a bad heart, and so I invented the glass heart. And then a few nights ago, someone slipped into my room and stole it while I was asleep. (bares empty chest) I've done what I can with these batteries. It's kept me stable, but... if I don't get my heart back, I'll die.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: You think Peter Bishop stole your heart?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: They disappeared at the same time. This heart is priceless. Who knows what somebody would pay for it. I have so much good left to do. If I die, I'll never get to finish any of them. All of my ideas... they will all die with me.\nELLA: (interrupts with a question) She's gonna help him, right?\nWALTER: Of course. But first, she needed to rehire her assistant, Esther Figglesworth. (draws a tight-lipped glare from Astrid)\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: (sitting before a stern nurse in health care facility) I have plenty of experience with all kinds of people. (chirpy and smiling) I'm sure that would come in handy, right? I mean, mental patients probably need tons of patience. (endearing) And love too. They probably need love, right? (sings) I really need this job... please God, I need this job... I've got to get this job.. (notices her radio phone is ringing) I'm sorry, excuse me. Oh, it's my old boss now. Can you give me just a second? She only calls when it's important. Or when she gets lost. (to fictional Olivia) What do you want?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: New case. I need you.\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: You sent me packing this morning, and you owe me six months' back-pay. What makes you think I'm gonna drop everything just because you call?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Because it's important. And because that's just the kind of girl you are. (drops the phone after getting clobber by the fictional Observer)\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: (hears the struggle) Dunham? Dunham, are you--\nFICTIONAL OBSERVER: Drop what you're investigating.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Who the hell are you?\nFICTIONAL OBSERVER: I'm the man who doesn't let his feelings get him into trouble.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (as the assailant uses a device the size of a pen to scribe a cut across her upper sternum) Ah!\nFICTIONAL OBSERVER: Don't stick your heart out where it doesn't belong.\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: I'm sorry. Does it hurt?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Oh, no, no, no. It feels great, actually. Please, keep-- keep doing it.\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: I can't believe you got sucked back into business over true love. You know that's your problem, isn't it? You're always looking for something that doesn't even exist.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Hey, that's not true. I'm not looking for someone who's gonna give his heart to the world. Maybe somewhere in the universe there's gotta be a guy who will keep me warm when I'm cold, feed me when I'm hungry, and maybe, on occasion, take me dancing.\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Mm. Huh, that's odd. It looks like it's healing. What kind of weapon did you say he used?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Well, nothing that I'd ever seen before. It was, like, some kind of... laser. This is the same kind of wound that killed Rachel. So the man who attacked me is the same man who took her heart.\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Draw it.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Draw what?\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: The weapon. I have an idea.\nFICTIONAL BRANDON: Yeah, the patent on this device was taken out last year. Pretty cool little device, if I recall. Was patented by this whiz-bang tech company out of Manhattan. Boy, I wish I could work somewhere like that. Big outfit, all kinds of spy stuff. They go by the name of...\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: ...Massive Dynamic.\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: You can't go in there! Miss Dunham!\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (barging in) A few hours ago, a man attacked me with that, and told me to forget I'd ever heard the name Peter Bishop. Now I can call the Feds or you can tell me the truth. You choose, lady.\nFICTIONAL NINA: (to her assistant) Bring me the file on the Quantum Laser. The device was developed here in our Biomedical Research Lab. It was designed as a surgical tool. Several months ago, one of our prototypes was stolen. But tell me... this man who attacked you, was he bald, with an odd cadence to his voice?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Who is he?\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Not he, they. We call them The Watchers. These people are dangerous and they don't make idle threats. You should know what you're getting into, Miss Dunham.\nELLA: (interrupting Walter's saga) She was lying.\nWALTER: Who?\nELLA: Nina Sharp. She was lying, wasn't she?\nWALTER: What makes you think that?\nELLA: I don't know, I just don't trust her.\nWALTER: Smart girl. You're getting ahead of the narrative, but you're thinking along the right lines. Because Detective Olivia didn't trust her either. Now... (continues the tale. Olivia destroys a brake light on Nina's parked car, then follows the vehicle through the night. she calls her office on the radio phone in the car)\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: (answers the call) Hello?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: It's me. You got anything?\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Nina Sharp's company, Massive Dynamic, the founder and CEO is a guy named William Bell. You ever heard of him?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: No. Should I have?\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Well, it seems he's a sort of scientific Christopher Columbus. He's always searching for what's right on the edge of our imagination. But here is the interesting part. In the past few years, no one has seen him. No press conferences, no public appearances. It's like he just disappeared off the face of the Earth.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay, so what's that got to do with Peter Bishop?\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: I don't know. But that's weird, right?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Yeah. Listen, I gotta go.\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Hey, Dunham?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Yeah?\nFICTIONAL ASTRID: Be careful.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (playful) Okay, Ma. (stops outside of Nina's house and watches through a window as Nina takes a video call inside)\nFICTIONAL NINA: I have news. Is it safe to talk?\nFICTIONAL BELL: Of course, no one can hear us. What is it?\nFICTIONAL NINA: I found it.\nFICTIONAL BELL: The glass heart?\nFICTIONAL NINA: Mm, you were right. Peter Bishop has it.\nFICTIONAL BELL: So where is he? Where's The Boy?\nFICTIONAL NINA: We don't know yet. But we'll find him.\nFICTIONAL BELL: Oh, that's fabulous news. Well done, Nina. I knew you could do it.\nFICTIONAL NINA: William, I've been going out of my mind.\nFICTIONAL BELL: By utilizing the heart's power, we'll be able to create a stable door between universes.\nFICTIONAL NINA: And after all this time, we can finally be together again.\nFICTIONAL BELL: I know, my love.\n(Olivia is attacked from behind and knocked unconscious. she comes-to in a boathouse next to a lake)\nFICTIONAL OBSERVER: Excuse me. (to Nina) She is awake.\nFICTIONAL NINA: (enters) I see. I suppose I should feel sorry for you, Miss Dunham. None of these should've been your concerns. The truth is I did everything I could to protect you. I warned you to stay away from this, but you didn't listen. Now you've given me no choice.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Oh, so you're gonna send me somewhere far away, where I won't be able to tell anybody what you wanna do with that glass heart?\nFICTIONAL NINA: Not quite. Go ahead Mister Gemini.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (as the man drags her to a wood crate and seals her in) No, no! No, no, no! (as he nails it shut) Ah. Ah! No! (as the crate is tossed into the water, then begins to fill) Help me! No! Ah!\nFICTIONAL PETER: (as he retrieves the crate and frees her) I heard you were looking for me.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (after climbing into his raft. exasperated) Thank you.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Feeling better?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Do you mean is a hot shower better than drowning in a pine coffin? Much. Thank you. I take it you don't live here.\nFICTIONAL PETER: No, but nobody else does either. Seemed like a pretty good place to hide out.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: (studies a map with multi-colored pins) But this is yours.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Yeah.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What is it?\nFICTIONAL PETER: You hungry?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: So how'd you know I was drowning?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Coffee?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Yeah, one sugar. Thanks.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Well, like I told you before, I heard somebody was looking for me. A cop named Olivia Dunham. So I was following you.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Well, someone's been giving you false information, because I'm not a Cop, I'm a Private Detective.\nFICTIONAL PETER: I see. You like Jazz?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Jazz?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Miles, Duke, Louis, John Coltrane... you can tell a lot about a person from the music they listen to. And whether or not they dance.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Uh, well, Jazz... not so much. But dancing? Sure.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Well, I guess we're opposites. I hate to dance. I'd take you, though.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: You would? Why's that?\nFICTIONAL PETER: I don't know, seems like it'd be fun. You look like a good dancer.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: You know, all this is very nice, and I'm grateful that you saved my life, but I know who you are, and I know what you did. Wanna know why I was looking for you? Doctor Walter Bishop hired me. I know you took his glass heart.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Is that what he told you? That I stole his heart? What else did Walter Bishop tell you?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: That without his heart he would die. And that all the good he does for this world would die with him.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Well, I guess I'm not the only one who's been given false information.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What, you saying that's not true?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Come with me. (leaves kitchen) A hundred and forty-seven pins. Each one represents a child injured by Walter Bishop.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Injured how?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Walter's invented a great many things. Wondrous things. That much is true. But what he didn't tell you is where his ideas come from. Elephants, rainbows, licorice sticks... they come from the dreams of children. He steals children's dreams and he replaces them with nightmares. That's what this is, a Pattern of Destruction. Of damaged kids, shattered innocence.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Who else knows about this?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Nobody. I worked for him for years, and I didn't even know. Why I was willing to die so that he could live. (opens shirt)\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: It's your heart.\nFICTIONAL PETER: I was born with it. And I was willing to give it to Walter, 'cause of all the good he's done. Because of all the good he could do. I thought that his life was so much more valuable than mine. At least until I learned the truth. Walter Bishop isn't responsible for all the goodness in the world. But he is responsible for so much evil. (the building shakes and a large metallic cylinder breaks through the wall) Oh, Hell.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: What is it?\nFICTIONAL PETER: They found us. (as Watchers bash open the doors and windows) Run! (Peter and Olivia fight hand-to-hand with the intruders. the Watchers start firing weapons. Olivia uses one of their weapons and fires back. she back tracks through the now empty house)\nFICTIONAL PETER: (sitting somberly on the floor) I knew you were a good dancer. You really cut a rug out there.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Well, you're not so bad yourself.\nFICTIONAL PETER: (expose the gapping damage in his chest) I need your help, Olivia. I'm dying.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay, I got them. So -- so what do I do?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Well... you ever play that game - Operation?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Yeah.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Well, it's just like that, except in reverse. You gotta put those batteries into my chest. But whatever you do, don't touch the nerve endings.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: And what if I do?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Don't.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Hey... you're gonna be fine. Just go slow, and take them one at a time.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay.\nFICTIONAL PETER: So what made you wanna be a detective?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: I don't know. Uh, I, uh... I guess that I just always knew what it was I was meant to do.\nFICTIONAL PETER: And what's that?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: To care for people.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Then who cares for you?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay. I did it.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Okay. There's one more. Must be nice to know who you are. To know your place in the world.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: So what about you?\nFICTIONAL PETER: Oh, I thought I did. I thought I knew who I was. But I was wrong.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Done. Peter? Peter? Peter? Please, Peter. (sings) For once in my life, I have someone who needs me. Someone I've needed so long, for once unafraid I can go where life leads me, and somehow I know I'll be strong. For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me... not like it's hurt me before. For once I have something I know won't desert me. I'm not alone anymore. Peter. Hey.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Hey. You did it.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay. You be careful.\nFICTIONAL PETER: These batteries aren't gonna last long.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Okay.\nFICTIONAL PETER: We have to get my heart back. Those men who attacked us, they work for Nina Sharp.\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: But Nina Sharp isn't the one who's got your heart.\nFICTIONAL PETER: Then who does?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: Put it down, Doctor Bishop.\nFICTIONAL WALTER: How did you know it was me?\nFICTIONAL OLIVIA: The device -- the one that came through the wall -- I knew that I had seen it someplace before. You brought Nina Sharp's Watchers to your side. Didn't you?\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Peter. Peter! I -- I never meant to hurt anyone. I never -- I can change, you'll see. I can make up for all the harm I've done. Peter, please. (sings) Who can take the sunrise? Sprinkle it with dew... the Candy Man can. Peter, please.\nFICTIONAL PETER: It's too late, Walter. There's some things you can't undo.\nFICTIONAL WALTER: (sings to himself after they leave) The Candy Man can... 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.\nELLA: (interrupts the fable) Are you kidding? That's not a proper ending. Don't you know? All good stories start with once upon a time, and they end with happily ever after. You don't know how to tell stories, Uncle Walter. I'll tell you how the story ends.\nFICTIONAL WALTER: Peter. Peter, please. I can change. I can fix the damage I've done. Please, give me another chance.\nELLA: (adding her ending to the tale) ...and Peter looked inside Walter's eyes and realized there was still goodness inside him. So Peter took his special heart, and with all his might, he split it in two. And the heart was so magical that it still worked. And together, they made goodness, and lived happily ever after. The End. (as Olivia returns to the lab) Aunt Liv! We had so much fun.\nOLIVIA: Did you? That's great.\nELLA: We played games kind of badly. Then Uncle Walter told me a story.\nOLIVIA: (quietly to Walter) I'm sorry, Walter. No luck.\nELLA: (about the story) His ending wasn't very good. It was sad. But I fixed it for him. Didn't I, Uncle Walter?\nWALTER: Yes. Yes, my dear, you were right. Yours was a proper ending. Yours was a much better ending, indeed.\n(Astrid has driven Walter home from the lab. They park on the street in front of the house and head inside. Down the street a ways, an acquaintance watches the arrival, then activates a hand-held communication device)\nTHE OBSERVER: The Boy has not returned, and I do not believe Doctor Bishop remembers my warning. (listens) Yes, I am concerned too."

Avoid the radar. You'll be in Oakland in no time. (hands him a CD) And that is for you, Raymond. And your burger should be up in a minute. (joins Peter at his table) So... where was I?\nPETER: Well, you were in the middle of telling me how you moved around a lot as a kid, but I got to tell you, now I'm hopelessly intrigued with these CDs.\nKRISTA MANNING: I'm sort of known here by the regulars for my playlists. I base my tracks on people's aura.\nPETER: Well, how often do you think I'd have to come here to be considered a regular?\nKRISTA MANNING: I might be able to get you on the list. First, you have to tell me where you're from.\nPETER: Technically... I'm from no place you've ever heard of. But let's just say Boston.\nKRISTA MANNING: So how long are you here for?\nPETER: Well, I was just planning on the one night -- passing through.\nKRISTA MANNING: To?\nPETER: I don't know yet.\nKRISTA MANNING: Okay... 'Peter from Boston'. I'll burn you one.\nPETER: Really? What did I do right?\nKRISTA MANNING: It's a long road to 'I don't know yet'. I want to make sure you stay awake out there. And I, uh -- I like your eyes. So there's that. Where are you staying?\nPETER: I'm staying at the Drake's Bay Motel.\nKRISTA MANNING: I'll drop it by after my shift.\nPETER: Okay, I'll see you then.\nKRISTA MANNING: I'll see you then. (later, after locking-up, she creates a music CD for Peter, then heads out for the rendezvous. outside in the darkness, a man approaches her as she starts to enter her car. several tractor-trailer rigs pass by and when they clear away, both individuals are gone, and Krista's car door remains open. she regains consciousness in a makeshift operating lab and is unable to move) No! No! No! Please? What are you doing to me? (a shadowy figure wearing surgical gloves stands over her... removing part of her brain through a hole in her skull)\nNEWSCAST: (television in the lobby of the Drake's Bay Motel is on as Peter wakes-up in the early morning light) ...it may not be the best season for Skagit Valley's famous waves of color, but with record warmth, it is still going to be one for the record books. In Mount Vernon, John Hofferstead, Q13, FOX News.\nTOM: Your room's got a bed, you know.\nPETER: What time is it?\nTOM: Six A.M.\nPETER: Did a pretty girl happen to drop by here? (realizing he was stood-up, he retires to his room and lays down. the phone rings) Hello? (odd static) Krista? (more static, beeps and distorted voices) Hello?\n(later, while driving away from the motel, he activates his navigation system)\nPETER: Destination.\nNAVIGATION SYSTEM: Please say a city name.\nPETER: Portland.\nNAVIGATION SYSTEM: Portland. Please proceed to the highlighted route.\nPETER: That was obviously way too easy. Destination.\nNAVIGATION SYSTEM: Please say a city name.\nPETER: Mars.\nNAVIGATION SYSTEM: Sorry. Please say the city name.\n(he notices the Hill-Top cafe is now a crime scene as he is leaving town. he pulls over and approaches the officer in charge)\nANN MATHIS: How you doing? I'm Sheriff Mathis. This is Deputy Ferguson.\nPETER: Hi, there. Peter Bishop.\nANN MATHIS: Were you a customer here last night?\nPETER: I was.\nANN MATHIS: Do you remember your waitress?\nPETER: Krista, sure. Why, did something happen to her?\nBILL FERGUSON: Do you have any identification on you?\nPETER: Of course. (the deputy walks away with the ID to verify it)\nANN MATHIS: Krista told a coworker she was planning to meet you after her shift last night.\nPETER: You gonna tell me what's going on here?\nANN MATHIS: You first.\nPETER: Yeah, we made plans. But she never showed up. She was gonna meet me at my motel, the Drake's Bay, but I just fell asleep in the lobby. You can call the front desk, ask the guy there.\nANN MATHIS: Why don't you just hang here a sec, okay? (Peter sees Thomas Newton loitering behind the assembled crowd a begins to move toward him) Where are you goin'? Who are you lookin' for?\nPETER: Um... No one. (after being escorted to the restraining cage in the back of the Sheriff's vehicle) Oh, come on, you got to be kidding me.\nANN MATHIS: Krista Manning went missing last night. And you talked to her. You two spent some time. I'd just like to hear about it. I'd like to do that at the station, okay?\nBILL FERGUSON: (on phone as the trio drives to the station) B-I-S-H-O-P. Uh, six feet, brown hair.\nPETER: (knocks on cage) Officer, I wasn't staying under the name Bishop. I was registered under the name Stewart.\nBILL FERGUSON: Yeah, he says he was staying under the name Stewart. Right, okay. Thanks, Tom. (hangs-up) Tom over at Drake's Bay confirms that he was passed out in the lobby all night.\nANN MATHIS: Why did you check into the motel under an assumed name, sir?\nRADIO DISPATCHER: Sheriff?\nANN MATHIS: (answers radio call) This is Mathis. Go ahead.\nRADIO DISPATCHER: Dogs have found a body -- the spillway off Route 219 and mile-marker eight. White female - coroner's on his way.\nANN MATHIS: (after arriving and stopping on the bridge, she recognizes Krista's corpse as it rests in the shallow waters along the bank of the river) Oh, my God.\nRADIO DISPATCHER: Noyo Search and Rescue, what's your 'twenty?\nWES: (over radio) E.T.A. About 45. Confirm this is recovery, not rescue.\nRADIO DISPATCHER: That's right, Wes. It's a bad one. The coroner says the victim had some sort of operation done to her. A piece of her skull cut out. Over.\nPETER: (having overheard the radio chatter) Sheriff... can you let me out of the back of this car?\nANN MATHIS: Just -- please, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to be patient, Mister Bishop.\nPETER: Hold on for one second. Hold on. I was listening to your radio. They said that she had a piece of her skull cut out. Is she missing a part of her brain? I know that that's a weird question, but you need to ask the Coroner whether she's missing a piece of her temporal lobe. Please.\nANN MATHIS: (walks over to associates. asks the question and returns to the vehicle) How the hell did you know that?\nANN MATHIS: You're F.B.I. huh? What exactly is a 'civilian consultant'?\nPETER: Sometimes people with certain areas of expertise can offer them to The Bureau on a consulting basis. My area of expertise is... weird.\nBILL FERGUSON: You mean difficult to explain?\nPETER: No, I mean the strange, the inexplicable.\nANN MATHIS: So, uh... can you talk me through this again? You knew that they took her...\nPETER: Temporal lobe.\nANN MATHIS: Temporal lobe... because it's like a case you worked on before?\nPETER: Exactly. We were never able to catch those responsible.\nANN MATHIS: So that's why you're out here. You're tracking them down?\nPETER: No. But I think that they may be tracking me down.\nANN MATHIS: What'd they want with you?\nPETER: I'm not sure yet. But I thought I saw one of them earlier outside the crime scene. His name is Newton. And I think they called me at the Drake's Bay Motel. There was no voice on the other end of the line. It was just static, and then a series of strange noises and clicks -- I think they killed Krista to find me.\nANN MATHIS: By taking her brain?\nPETER: I told her where I was staying. She's the only person who knew.\nBILL FERGUSON: Why wouldn't they just... ask her where you were staying? Or force her. I mean, why cut out her brain?\nPETER: It's possible that they needed details about me she didn't know she had.\nANN MATHIS: I'm sorry. I'm not following.\nPETER: I know that this is complicated. And I'm sorry that I can't give you all the answers, but the case is classified. It is possible, however, that I could show you what I mean.\nANN MATHIS: Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go make a few calls, Peter.\nPETER: Of course. (makes a call while the Sheriff investigates him)\nBROYLES: (answers his phone while sitting in his office) Bishop, where are you?\nPETER: I'll save you the trace. I'm in Washington State. Look, I need a favor. You're about to get a call from the Noyo County Sheriff's Department. They're checking up on my credentials.\nBROYLES: Are you in trouble?\nPETER: ...uhnt-uh. In fact, just the opposite. I stumbled into an investigation, and I offered them my services.\nBROYLES: We'll ask them to extend you every courtesy.\nPETER: Thank you. Listen... I don't want you to tell Walter where I am. In fact, I don't even want you to tell him that we spoke. If you owe me anything, you owe me that.\nBROYLES: Okay. But, Bishop... if you change your mind, I'll send someone to pick you up.\nPETER: Thanks. I got to go.\nBROYLES: Take care of yourself.\nPETER: (standing over his new friends body as it lay on the examination table) Krista seemed like a sweet girl. Did you know her?\nANN MATHIS: She and my sister went to school together. So explain this to me.\nPETER: The temporal lobe is responsible for memory. So think of the brain as the greatest recording device ever created. Every sight, sound, smell, all recorded in perfect detail. But imagine that there was a way to get that data out of the brain. So what I said, what I was wearing, What time it was, where I was staying... I know how it sounds. But believe me, if you can imagine it, it's possible.\nANN MATHIS: If that's true, if they were trying to find you, why didn't they just come for you last night?\nPETER: I... I don't know. These are not your ordinary bad guys.\nANN MATHIS: (looks at the opening in Krista's skull) The tissue is very pink.\nPETER: Yes, and it's not normally like that. It only happens when our bodies metabolize adrenaline. So her adrenal's must have spiked right before she died.\nANN MATHIS: (after her lucky pen falls into a tray with blood in it. disappointed) Oh... my God.\nPETER: (reads the motto on the pen as he cleans it) ...\"find the crack\"? That is the worst police slogan I've ever heard.\nANN MATHIS: It's not a slogan. In the darkness, there's always a crack. It's how the light gets in. Ferguson gave it to me... our first case together. Nobody else thought I could hack it, but... it's -- it's an inside joke.\nPETER: It looks expensive.\nANN MATHIS: Yeah. That's what he keeps telling me.\nBILL FERGUSON: If that's an accurate account of your statement, please sign it.\nPETER: It is, very. (signs the statement) I'm gonna get a room at the Northwest Passage. I'll be staying under the name of... Gene Cowan. So if you need me, that's where I'm at.\nBILL FERGUSON: You sure you don't want a police escort?\nPETER: No, I'll be fine.\nBILL FERGUSON: You know, you say that there are people out there cutting people's brains out to find you, and you're smiling.\nPETER: Look, they may have found me. But now that I know they're here for sure, I found them too. And now we're gonna catch 'em.\nANN MATHIS: What?\nBILL FERGUSON: I don't know about this guy, Ann.\nANN MATHIS: He knew his way around there. He's like a Medical Examiner. He knew the brain, biology, medications.\nBILL FERGUSON: Doesn't mean he's legit. You read your books about UFOs and Roswell and whacked-out theories and government conspiracies. I think that you want to believe. What makes you trust him?\nANN MATHIS: I don't know. (honestly) I'm a good judge of character. (sardonically) I'm the only one here who likes you.\nWEAPONS DEALER: (peering through peep hole in door after Peter buzzes to open) Closed. What do you want?\nPETER: If you open up, I'll make it worth your while. (holds-up roll of cash)\n(after moving into his new room, he unloads a shotgun, pistol and ammunition. as he prepares the weapons the motel phone rings)\nPETER: Mathis? (he hangs up when he hears the same static and distorted voices he heard previously. when the phone rings again) What do you want from me?\nANN MATHIS: (from her office) Peter... it's Mathis.\nPETER: Who did you tell?\nANN MATHIS: What are you talking about?\nPETER: Just now, I got one of those phone calls. They know where I'm staying. And I only told you.\nANN MATHIS: ...I didn't --\nPETER: -- Then ask your partner!\nANN MATHIS: That's what I'm calling about, Peter. Ferguson's -- Ferguson's disappeared.\nPETER: When was the last time that you spoke with him?\nANN MATHIS: About two hours. He went back to the scene where Krista's body was found. He felt we might have missed something.\nPETER: That means that he disappeared about a half hour before I got the last phone call.\nANN MATHIS: You think they used him to find you, like they used Krista. What is it that makes you special? Why haven't they taken you?\nPETER: I don't know. I don't even know what it all means, but I do know that these people have the answers. And that's exactly why I need to find them.\nANN MATHIS: Alright then. Call your friends at the F.B.I. Let's get these guys!\nPETER: No.\nANN MATHIS: The F.B.I. has the expertise. They have the resources.\nPETER: And if we call the F.B.I., they're gonna descend on this place, and these people will disappear. I am this close. And I am going to get my answers.\nANN MATHIS: You said you got calls at Drake's Bay and Northwest Passage, right?\nPETER: Yes.\nANN MATHIS: Mm-hmm. Well, we pulled those phone records. Those calls never happened.\nPETER: These people can pull memories out of brain tissue. You think they can't make a couple of calls disappear? I can do that. People have been doing that since the '70s. (studies her body language) I understand. You don't want me to be right, 'cause if I'm right, then that means your partner is most likely dead.\nANN MATHIS: Hey... Peter... with the exception of who you are, I haven't been able to verify anything you've said to me. It's all either classified, or it's incredible. I'm calling the Bureau.\nPETER: Your partner did disappear. And I did talk to Krista. And I did get those phone calls.\nANN MATHIS: What if he's alive? What if he's out there somewhere, thinking I am doing everything in my power, including calling the F.B.I. to save him?\nPETER: Then that is all the more reason for us to find him ourselves. If you make that phone call, we never will.\nWALTER: (to a fellow shopper) Excuse me, please. Thank you. Toaster pastry. (reads the ingredients listed) um...'corn starch, soy lecithin, potassium... bromate'. Potassium bromate? (starts to meltdown emotionally) This supermarket is trying to kill us! You... potassium bromate - do you know what that is?\nSTOCK CLERK: Are you okay, sir?\nWALTER: It is known to induce renal cell tumors... mesotheliomas of the peritoneum!\nSTOCK CLERK: Can I call someone for you?\nWALTER: Call someone? You know what? You know what you're putting into our bodies? Death! Delicious, strawberry-flavored death!\nSTOCK CLERK: Okay, okay. I'm calling security.\nWALTER: Yes! (wipes brow and sits in the aisle)\nWALTER: (returning through the front door) They had no right to make me wait at the police station. It's the makers of those toaster pastries that should be in jail.\nASTRID: Let it go, Walter. You're home now, and you're safe.\nWALTER: (looks at the messy room) I wasn't expecting guests.\nASTRID: (returns from the barren refrigerator) Walter... why didn't you tell me you needed help?\nWALTER: What am I going to do -- call you every time I run out of 'Pudding Pops'?\nOLIVIA: Yes, if you need them.\nWALTER: I need to learn to care for myself. If Peter doesn't come back --\nOLIVIA: Walter...\nWALTER: They'll send me back to the hospital, won't they?\nOLIVIA: I won't let that happen.\nWALTER: Thank you. I do... I do need 'Pudding Pops'.\nANN MATHIS: (walking with Peter) We don't know if he made it, but this is the last place he said he was going.\nPETER: Isn't it protocol for him to call in once he gets here?\nANN MATHIS: Well... sometimes he doesn't do that. Dummy.\n(the two separate and head to opposite ends of the bridge. Peter stops and picks-up a gum wrapper, then hears the same odd noises he heard on the phone. something in the woods catches his eye and he runs to the edge of a clearing where Thomas Newton and his assistant are standing. the assistant adjusts a handheld device and the noise stops. Newton raises a weapon and fires a large dart at Peter. nearly struck, Peter pulls his pistol and fires back... his targets immediately vanish into the dense evergreen forest)\nANN MATHIS: (hears the gunfire) Bishop? (runs to the other end of the bridge and enters the woods looking for Peter, as he chases the evasive Newton) Bishop! (after sneaking-up behind him) Peter.\nPETER: Mathis.\nANN MATHIS: What did you see?\nPETER: I saw Newton and one other guy. You didn't see them too? They came running right past you.\nANN MATHIS: (as he stares at her arm) What's wrong? (after he levels his pistol at her) What the Hell are you doing, Bishop? Put down that gun.\nPETER: Who are you?\nANN MATHIS: Bishop... lower... your... weapon.\nPETER: In the morgue, you dropped something. Who gave it to you?\nANN MATHIS: What is wrong with you?\nPETER: Answer the question!\nANN MATHIS: My pen? It was a gift from Ferguson, my partner.\nPETER: Why is there blood on your jacket?\nANN MATHIS: There is blood on my jacket because there is blood on my wrist, which I got when I fell, running.\nPETER: Show me. (inspects her arm) I'm sorry. I needed to know that your blood was still red.\nANN MATHIS: What other color would it be?\n(a short while later, back at their vehicle on the bridge as Peter helps her with first aide for her wound)\nANN MATHIS: So these, uh, shape-shifters, they... make themselves look like other people?\nPETER: Yeah, it's a technology unlike anything you've seen before.\nANN MATHIS: Peter... I want to level with you. I, um... believe in the unknown.\nPETER: Yeah - \"find the crack\" - I get it.\nANN MATHIS: No, I mean... I read books about... UFOs and conspiracy theories. But I do think... I mean, I am wondering right now... if you are not completely off your rocker.\nPETER: They were there.\nANN MATHIS: I didn't see them... or the dart they shot.\nPETER: I know you didn't, because they removed it. I know how this must look... from your point of view -- I mean, I was there once too. But...\nANN MATHIS: (about his hesitation) You just did it.\nPETER: Did what?\nANN MATHIS: You just questioned your own sanity.\nPETER: I'm not questioning --\nANN MATHIS: -- When was the last time you slept?\nPETER: I'm not hallucinating. And I'm not paranoid. And I'm not questioning my own sanity. I was wondering why you would listen to me. You're desperate. Ferguson is more than just your partner, isn't he? So there is something between the two of you.\nANN MATHIS: You said back at the precinct that... that I was trying to rationalize that he was still alive. You may be right. I may be doing it right now. He may be dead. But I won't believe it until I see his body. I can't. (answers cell phone) Mathis.\nPETER: You want me to go look? (she shakes her head then moves toward the victim)\nDEPUTY: Sheriff. The victim's a white female. She has part of her skull missing.\nPETER: I don't recognize this girl.\nANN MATHIS: You've never seen her before?\nPETER: No, I've never seen her before.\nANN MATHIS: Who is she?\nHEATHER: I talked to Gwynn right before her shift ended. We'd talked about her coming over last night to help me color my hair. I figured she just got tired. I should have called her.\nANN MATHIS: You couldn't have known. I'm sorry.\nPETER: Did your sister ever hang out at the Hill-Top Cafe?\nHEATHER: Um... I don't think so.\nPETER: What about the Mosser Brothers gas station out on Route 202? I filled up there on the way into town.\nHEATHER: Her pickup's a diesel, and I don't think Mosser's carries diesel.\nPETER: Fine, what about the Drake's Bay Motel? Would she ever go there for any reason?\nANN MATHIS: Peter...\nHEATHER: What's this about?\nANN MATHIS: It's just... part of our investigation. If you could just write down your address for us. She is grieving, and you are not getting anywhere.\nWALTER: (after putting on some music) The Hadron Super Collider is less complicated than that infernal dishwasher.\nASTRID: (standing over a sink of dishes) Next time, don't use laundry detergent, and the dishwasher will work fine.\nWALTER: Thank you, Astrid. You're a Federal Agent. I doubt, during your years of training, that you had dreams of babysitting a helpless old man.\nASTRID: You are not that helpless. A little disorganized, maybe. Don't you usually keep this in the bathtub? (hands him a toy double-decker car) Walter?\nWALTER: (recalling) I took this little car from the Zelazney Building. Objects from the other universe like this emit a glimmer, a distinctive energy signature. It may be possible to detect that signature.\nASTRID: So?\nWALTER: So I need you to gather all the objects from the other side that we recovered from the Zelazney Building and from Jacksonville and bring them to the lab.\nASTRID: Okay, why?\nWALTER: To build a device to read that energy signature! Peter emits the same energy, don't you see? This is how we will find Peter.\nPETER: I must have seen Gwynn somewhere, or she had to have seen me. I mean... she has to have had some value to them, some knowledge that they needed.\nANN MATHIS: We'll go to your motel and get your things, get you something to eat, and... you can stay at my house tonight.\nPETER: It's okay. I'll be fine.\nANN MATHIS: You're my only connection to finding Bill right now. I want you safe. (notices a vehicle at the edge of the woods) What color was Gwynn's truck?\nPETER: Tan brown.\nANN MATHIS: Driver's side window is rolled down. Glove compartment's open.\nPETER: Okay, so this girl pulls over her truck, rolls down the window, and then opens up the glove box. You tell me - why would she do that?\nANN MATHIS: She got pulled over by a cop.\nPETER: Or someone pretending to be a cop -- or Bill.\nANN MATHIS: Pretending to be Bill?\nPETER: Well, these shape-shifters, they take on the appearance of people in positions of authority. (as she returns to her vehicle) Where you going?\nANN MATHIS: I'm calling the F.B.I.\nPETER: Why?\nANN MATHIS: First, you said they cut out his brain to find you. Now you're telling me he may have been shape-shifted? Which is it, Peter? Did I make a mistake not calling the F.B.I.? I am very scared right now.\nPETER: Wait, wait-wait. Just hold on for one second. Those people, when they were taken, they must have been afraid, right? And when they were killed, they must have been terrified.\nANN MATHIS: So?\nPETER: So I know how to find them.\nPETER: Do you know how airplanes have blackboxes?\nANN MATHIS: To record flight data, sure.\nPETER: Yeah, well, human bodies collect data as well. Both Krista and Gwynn's muscle tissue was flooded with adrenaline.\nANN MATHIS: Yeah, I remember.\nPETER: Well, the tissue would've partially metabolized the adrenaline. So we should be able to measure the rate of absorption, which will tell us when the adrenaline was first produced.\nANN MATHIS: What about Newton? How does that help us find him?\nPETER: Look... normally, your adrenaline levels are flat. (draws diagram on chalkboard) Then you experience fear. A spike in adrenaline. Sometime later, you experience more fear, say, in the moments right before you were killed -- another spike, two points of fear. Now, we already know where the girls were abducted. So if we can just determine how much time took place between these two intervals...\nANN MATHIS: ...then we can figure out where they were killed.\nPETER: Exactly right. There is one more thing. We're gonna need a control sample. Can you stick that in the centrifuge? (turns to the machine) It's that thing right over there. (fires his pistol into the ceiling when her back is turned)\nANN MATHIS: Ah. (startled... turns and starts to draw weapon from holster) Hey!\nPETER: I'm sorry! I'm sorry. (very apologetic) I just needed to scare you. (unsheathes a large biopsy needle) I'm gonna need to take a tissue sample from you.\nBROYLES: (sitting across from his agent) How is Doctor Bishop doing?\nOLIVIA: Walter's trying to adjust to a very difficult situation. He's concerned about being sent back to St. Claire's.\nBROYLES: Will he be able to function if Peter doesn't come back?\nOLIVIA: I'm sure that Peter will come back. Do you know something? Have you spoken to him?\nPETER: Krista Manning's adrenaline spikes were forty-two minutes apart. So assuming that Newton drove the speed limit, sixty miles an hour...\nANN MATHIS: ...on these roads, that'd be a good way to get killed. He would have stuck to forty-five.\nPETER: Alright, forty-five. (plots circles on a Noyo County map) Okay, the center point is where Krista was taken. At forty-five miles per hour, The farthest they could have gone would be thirty-one and a half miles. Gwynn, our second victim... was taken much farther out of town, almost on the other side of the county. Her adrenaline spikes are fifty-seven minutes apart. Again, factoring forty-five miles per hour... that's it. (points to sliver between overlapping circles) That's our 'kill-zone'.\nANN MATHIS: You're assuming he killed them both in the same place.\nPETER: They were using complex medical equipment. It's not easy to move an operating room. Much simpler to just bring the victims to a specified location -- someplace out of the way.\nANN MATHIS: (points to a facility on the map within the region identified by Peter) Like an old dairy farm?\nPETER: Just ask him something only he would know.\nANN MATHIS: Hello, there. It's, uh, Craig, right?\nCRAIG: Yeah.\nANN MATHIS: I don't know if you remember, but, uh, I think you were in choir with my sister up at St. Andrew's.\nCRAIG: Well, actually, I was at Good Shepherd. Good memory, though.\nANN MATHIS: Yeah, Good Shepherd - that's right.\nCRAIG: So, uh, what can I do for you?\nANN MATHIS: Your old dairy farm up the hill. Could there be people up there?\nCRAIG: People?\nPETER: Yeah, you get up there often?\nCRAIG: No, not much, since we shut it down. Why? (later, inside the house and reviewing a map of the property) Okay, we got twelve outbuildings -- the milking parlors, the barn, and the holding stalls.\nANN MATHIS: Those are all good places to hide.\nPETER: That's a lot of ground to cover.\nANN MATHIS: I'll go call backup to help with the search. (leaves the house)\nCRAIG: Need any help with the search?\nPETER: I think it's best if you stay here.\nCRAIG: Let me get you the keys. (turns to retrieve something on the far side of the room)\nPETER: Sure. (looks around the room and notices the CD that Krista made for him. turns to Craig charging at him... swinging a hammer)\nCRAIG: (as he is physically beaten) Uhh! Ohh! Uhh! Uhh! Unh! Uhh! Uh!\nPETER: Who are you? Where's Newton? (punches Craig's face again)\nANN MATHIS: Peter, stop!\nCRAIG: I couldn't stop. The girls -- I wanted to be close to them. I just couldn't stop.\nANN MATHIS: Where is he? Where's Ferguson? What did you do to him?\n(searching a dark outbuilding full of medical equipment)\nANN MATHIS: Bill? (weapon drawn and flashlight on) Bill? (enters a dark room) Peter... Bill! Bill... He's still breathing. Thank God. Bill.\nPETER: It's just ink. There's no incision here. I'm gonna go call an ambulance.\nANN MATHIS: Bill. Stay with me, baby. I'm here. I'm here now. I'm here, Bill.\n(standing in a field near the barn, after more law enforcement has arrived)\nPETER: I don't know what to say.\nANN MATHIS: You saved Bill's life, and you tracked a killer - what else is there to say? I wish there was something I could do for you. Whatever your experiences are, whatever you can't or won't tell me about... I think you're looking for meaning in things that... have no meaning.\nPETER: I don't know who I am anymore.\nANN MATHIS: When I was in college... my family was killed. Murdered.\nPETER: I'm sorry.\nANN MATHIS: Sometimes I still think... one day I might catch whoever did it. I was alone for a long time. But I found my place. You will too.\nWALTER: Once we isolate the glimmer, we can find Peter. Is the spectrograph ready, Agent Farnsworth?\nASTRID: Walter, you put in the wrong numbers.\nWALTER: No, no, I believe they're correct.\nASTRID: No, they're not. But, then, you know that already, don't you? I thought you wanted to find Peter.\nWALTER: What if he won't forgive me, Astrid? All I have now is hope -- hope that he will come to understand why I did the things I did. What if I find him, and he won't forgive me? What do I have then?\nOLIVIA: (joins the conversation) Hey.\nASTRID: Hey, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Walter... I found Peter.\nWALTER: W - where?\nOLIVIA: He's in Washington State. I'm heading to the airport now. Would you like to come with me, Walter?\nWALTER: I'll need to pack a bag.\n(he puts his pistol on the nightstand next the bed, looks at the compact disk that Krista made for him, puts the CD in a disk player and lays on the bed listening to music as he rests his eyes. music = \"I could sleep, I could sleep, I could sleep, I could sleep, I could sleep... when I lived alone... is there a ghost in my house? My house)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (startles Peter as he stands over him with a pistol) Peter, Peter. (summons a man from the other room) Mister Secretary.\nMISTER SECRETARY: (enters the room) Hello, Son.\n(Peter is stunned and amazed - meeting his original father from the alternate universe)"

Local -- Brooklyn! Confirmed -- we've got a breach!\nSUPERVISOR: Lock it down.\nAGENT FRANCIS: (walking in from a side room) Oh, I was thinking, hey, maybe a slow day, it being Saturday and all. No rest for the wicked.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (strolling in from the lobby) Oh, you're not wicked, Charlie. You just pretend really, really well.\nLINCOLN LEE: (stepping out of the elevator) Somebody playing my song?\nMILITARY TECHNICIAN: Class-One Event, sir.\nLINCOLN LEE: I can see that. You? (to Francis and Dunham)\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yes, I can.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Clear as day.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (stepping from his office) Okay people, nap time's over. Let's go to work.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (gearing-up and harassing Francis about the injection he just gave himself) So exactly how big would the worms get if you stopped dosing yourself?\nAGENT FRANCIS: They're not worms.\nTACTICAL TEAM: (in unison) They're arachnids.\nLINCOLN LEE: (reviews handheld monitor) SitRep as follows. Class-One Molecular Dissolution. Numbers show severe molecular cohesion failure. This isn't just a little tear. We got a full-fledged hole here, people.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Has anything come through it?\nLINCOLN LEE: No data yet.\nTEAM MEMBER: On site in less than sixty seconds.\nAGENT FRANCIS: As long as it's not bugs.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, it's probably bugs. What? Bugs like you.\nAGENT FRANCIS: On my six! Go! Go! Go! Go!\nTEAM LEADER: (as a dozen armed team members empty from the van and into the theater) Move! Move!

I'm showing Stage-Three degradation.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (on radio. sitting at his desk and repsonding to the data he is being fed) I need data that tells me this event is contained, Captain.\nLINCOLN LEE: I'm trying here.

Stat.\nTECHNICIAN: (over radio) The Looker's being dispatched now, sir.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (interviewing onlookers outside of the theater) Hi. I'm Agent Dunham with Fringe Division. Could I see your Show Me please?\nWITNESS: Sure. (hands-over personal identification card) You ain't gonna quarantine the place, right?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (inspects and returns ID) There's nothing to worry about. But if you could tell me what you saw -- I mean, even small things could be important.\nLINCOLN LEE: (on the phone after floating a silver dollar on clear liquid in a small jar) I'm getting decreased gravity measurements here, Colonel. (holds-up small electronic device) Activating Quarantine Potentiator.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Agent Farnsworth?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (sitting at a large table monitor next to him. mechanical, almost autistic, response) Broyles.

Warning...\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Recommendation, Agent.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Gravitational and molecular degeneration are decreasing, but outside acceptable parameters.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Recommendation, Agent Farnsworth?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Calculating.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Massive loss of life will result.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (joining Lincoln on the theater stage) Really?\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Forty seconds to quarantine. Quarantine device unlocked.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: God, and I didn't even update my will.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Massive loss of life will result.\nLINCOLN LEE: Frank would just spend it all anyway.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Warning. Thirty seconds to quarantine.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Recommendation, Agent Farnsworth?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (intense study of the data stream) Event is terminating - no quarantine recommended.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (on radio) Captain, you are clear. Do not quarantine. Repeat -- do not quarantine.\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Twenty seconds to quarantine. Massive loss of life...\nLINCOLN LEE: (casually to Bolivia) We've got to stop doing this. (disarms the quarantine device)\nAUTOMATED VOICE: Warning...\nAGENT FRANCIS: (from the mezzanine) Hey, guys. We got something up here. I wish it was bugs.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What is that?\nLINCOLN LEE: (studying the tumor rich corpse of James Heath) These look like carcinomas. There's no way anyone could live long enough to develop tumors this severe. (to Olivia) Witnesses have anything?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The usual -- I mean, they heard a tearing sound. They saw a blue flash through the window. I gave them Chips so they could get radiation scans.\nLINCOLN LEE: Let's see if he has any I.D. Guy may have had a wife and kids before the universe sucked him up and spat him out.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (removes a wallet from the coat pocket) Poor guy.\nLINCOLN LEE: (inspects a driver's license) That's not a Show Me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (scans a 20 dollar bill from the wallet) Okay. (hands the bill to Lee) Check this out.\nLINCOLN LEE: (studies the image on the bill) Who the hell is Jackson?\nWALTER: (hiding in a nearby aisle with Cortexiphan test subjects) Olivia. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on, everyone. Keep down. Come on. Come on. (as they crawl to elude capture. a dirigible airship motors overhead, visible through the skylight in the theater. outside, a gray and cloudy looms over Brooklyn and Manhatan)\n(a day and a half before crawling in the aisles of the Orpheum Opera House, Walter sits in his lab and watches Peter and Secretary Bishop exit a room in the Northwest Passage motel)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (on recording) I can take you back where you belong, son. They have our coordinates. But if you come with me, you won't be able to come back here. You have to make a choice, Peter.\nPETER: (on recording) Let's go. (the quality of the image blurs to static, then clears. Peter and his father are both gone)\n(Olivia sits alone in a quiet bar and accepts a straight-up neat refill of her favorite adult beverage. In his lab, the dismayed Walter gets to his feet and starts searching storage boxes. In the bar, Olivia sits at the counter and sips silently... a bald man in a dark suit and hat quietly drops a piece of paper on the seat next to Olivia and leaves through the service area behind the bar. Olivia looks up and takes note of the familiar man, then notices what has been left for her on the seat. Walter continues his search, becomes frustrated, then calls Olivia on her cell phone)\nOLIVIA: Hello?\nWALTER: (raised agitated voice) Hello, Agent Dunham. There... there is something I am supposed to remember, and I can't remember what it is, but it's about Peter.\nOLIVIA: Walter?\nWALTER: No, no, no! I think something is going to happen to him. (Olivia looks at the paper that was delivered to her. A large device is sketched in black and white. Peter's image has fire\/smoke coming from his eyes. A, C, G and T is written across several columns of the paper) Something... something terrible.\nWALTER: I think this is what I'm supposed to remember.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Well, one of those men -- you know, the Observers -- I think he left it for me.\nWALTER: Well, after I brought Peter from the other side, some years later, one of them came to visit me. Well -- well, he told me that I had to agree to never let Peter return to the other side.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nWALTER: Well.. because if I did, this would happen.\nOLIVIA: Okay, but what is this, Walter? What does it even mean?\nWALTER: Look, look, it is exactly what it happens to be. See? I think my son... is going to be responsible for the end of the world.\nOLIVIA: Okay look Walter, we have to get Peter back.\nWALTER: He went over by his own free will.\nOLIVIA: But he didn't know about this.\nWALTER: Well, even if he wanted...\nOLIVIA: ...Walter! How do we get him back?\nWALTER: We have no way of contacting--\nOLIVIA: Walter! How?\nCORPORATE SECURITY: I\u2019m sorry, sir, I can't let you go in there. This is...\nBROYLES: ...Don't even think about it!\nNINA: What is this, Phillip?\nBROYLES: We have reason to believe your company is manufacturing weapons for the other side.\nNINA: Oh, that\u2019s absurd.\nBROYLES: I want every piece of data even remotely related to the other universe.\nNINA: How dare you? Are you out of your mind?\nOLIVIA: Stop it, both of you! Peter is in danger. Walter says that this technology has a very specific and recognizable design.\nWALTER: I dare say Nina would agree.\nNINA: Dear God. What side is this?\nWALTER: Does it matter?\nNINA: This is William's technology, but we didn't build it.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Nina, listen to me. Peter's been taken. You have to help us cross-over.\nBRANDON: The thing is, to get over there, that's uh, really a misnomer. In truth, the two universes are overlapping. And to get to the other side, our universe needs to pass through you, literally, like -- like water passing through a cheesecloth. Our cells need to separate on an atomic level. The problem is, when they come back together, they don't come back together with the same cohesion. Somehow, Bell managed to cross back and forth, although precisely how, we can find no record of. But I suspect that whatever methodology, he crossed so many times that he's become like this coffee cup -- molecularly unstable.\nWALTER: As many atoms in each of us... as there are stars in the sky. It's why Belly never came back, isn't it? Because he was scared that the same thing would happen to him.\nNINA: I don't know. I've sent him communications, but if he got them, he hasn't been able to communicate to me.\nOLIVIA: There has to be a way. What about how you crossed over when you first got Peter?\nWALTER: The last time I opened a door, it set in motion the ripples that weakened the very fabric of our reality. To do so again could instantly shatter both worlds... and likely would.\nNINA: Brandon, give us a moment. You know, unlike William, you have the ability to cross over safely.\nOLIVIA: I can't. I \u2013 I - I mean, I \u2013 I - I can't control it. I've -- I've flashed over for a few seconds, or Bell's pulled me over, but I \u2013 I - I can't control it, not on my own.\nWALTER: Not on your own, but if there were two or three of you, a \u2013 a - a larger power supply, as it were.\nBROYLES: I'm not following.\nWALTER: With more Cortexiphan children, their collective psychic energy could... you know, Belly and I always agreed that that primal part of the brain which allows us to cross universes is also responsible for a host of - of paranormal activities -- pyrokinesis, telepathy, thought control. And that we all had these abilities until\u2026 \u2018til there was a moment in history when something was done to us, and -- and it was shut down. I suspect aliens. Unfortunately, the only other Cortexiphan children that we have located, they have failed or worse. You... are the only one left.\nBROYLES: Actually... she's not.\nBROYLES: There are still over a dozen Cortexiphan subjects unaccounted for. Prudence dictated we determine what we might be dealing with in the future.\nOLIVIA: So you woke all three of them up?\nBROYLES: Actually, five. We've tracked down some others.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nBROYLES: About six weeks ago, Massive Dynamic proposed a series of experiments to help them gain control of, and repurpose their abilities. These three have been quite successful. James Heath can now cure disease, not cause it. Sally Clark is becoming a fully functional pyrokinetic. And your friend Nick Lane's empathic transfers can now be controlled.\nNICK LANE: Olive.\nSALLY CLARK: Nick. Very good, baby.\nNICK LANE: Welcome to the Monkey House.\nOLIVIA: This is new. Who authorized it?\nBROYLES: Senate Intelligence... thanks to Peter. It was part of a list of demands he gave me right before I went to secure our funding.\nNICK LANE: This is very \u2018\u2019Mission Impossible\u2019\u2019.\nJAMES HEATH: I know you. You're the man that experimented on us. I could kill you where you stand.\nWALTER: Each of you could. What I did... was inexcusable... barbaric. The collateral damage has been extensive. But know that we had noble goals. We believed that our world needed guardians, protectors, that you children would be those protectors. We fostered your talents because we foresaw that the day would come when both universes would be in jeopardy. So... horrible as it is to say, today is the day for which you were created. What I could never have imagined is that I would be asking you to help me save my son. I'm so sorry. Well, if none of you are gonna kill me... I think I'll go and have a bit of a cry.\nNICK LANE: Man, that's not the same guy I remember.\nJAMES HEATH: He's exactly the same.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop has identified a likely spot to attempt a crossover - Brooklyn, New York. You go at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow morning. You might want to get some rest.\nJAMES HEATH: Hey, F.B.I. guy. We're about to go save the world, right? Two worlds even. Can't we have a night off?\nBROYLES: Whatever they want.\nDYING WOMAN: Who are you?\nJAMES HEATH: I was never lucky, you know? Sometimes people need some good luck. Tonight I guess that's me. Who else do we have?\nSALLY CLARK: Sweet.\nNICK LANE: Hmm. Me or the strawberry?\nSALLY CLARK: Both.\nNICK LANE: So what would you like this time -- to feel what I'm feeling, or what you're feeling?\nSALLY CLARK: Both.\nWALTER: Please God?.\nELLA: Aunt Liv, what time is it?\nOLIVIA: It's early. I have to go on a trip, and, uh... I wanted to give you something before left.\nELLA: It's pretty.\nOLIVIA: My mother... your grandmother... gave it to me before she died. She told me that it would keep me safe. So now I'm giving it to you.\nELLA: Thanks, Aunt Liv.\nOLIVIA: You are welcome, baby girl.\nRACHEL: You're up early. I didn't even hear you come in last night.\nOLIVIA: No, I've been working a case.\nRACHEL: Think you'll be home for dinner?\nOLIVIA: I hope so. I'll call you and let you know.\nRACHEL: Okay. Hey, you okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. We should do this more often. It's nice.\nRACHEL: Sure.\nELLA: Look what Aunt Liv gave me.\nBROYLES: Even assuming this works -- that you make it to the other side -- you still have no idea how you're going to locate Peter.\nOLIVIA: No, but I spoke to Nina Sharp, and she sent a message to William Bell asking him to meet us at the Grayshot Bridge in Central Park at four P.M. I think he'll help us find Peter.\nBROYLES: Dunham... Massive Dynamic didn't make that weapon over here. That means Bell may have made it on the other side for them.\nOLIVIA: No. I trust him.\nBROYLES: In any case, Nina has no confirmation that Bell even gets her messages.\nOLIVIA: No.\nBROYLES: In which case, you're essentially invading enemy territory without a plan. You don't know anything about the opposition, the landscape...\nWALTER: Oh, we're ready. We're ready to try this.\nBROYLES: You can't tell me you think this is a good idea.\nOLIVIA: No. I don't think that this is a good idea. Do you got a better one?\nWALTER: It was lovely, wasn't it? Now... faded and broken just like me.\nOLIVIA: So how does this work, Walter?\nWALTER: Remember your Shakespeare, Dear. \"all the world is a stage\"... or in this case, both worlds. You will form a circle. I - I will stand in the middle, and I will lead you across.\nBROYLES: No. You can't do this.\nWALTER: (to Broyles) Oh, no. No. (to Olivia) He is my son, Olivia.\nBROYLES: You can't do this. I won't allow it.\nWALTER: I believe I can. Or -- or else they cannot. I can't ask them to do something that I - I'm not willing to chance myself. Thank you. Well, if any of you have changed your minds, I will understand.\nNICK LANE: We were talking about it on the way over here. Maybe you did damage us. But on the other hand, maybe you made us special. Fate is a tricky thing.\nWALTER: So, um... you -- you would want to take a few steps back I think, Agent Broyles. Olivia. Now, I want you to clear your minds and -- and just relax. Alright? Now, ignore everything except the sound of my voice. Now... sp-spread out your arms. You remember how. Spread them out to each other. Yes. Good. Now, I want you to think back to when you were just young children Back to when you were just young boys and girls. Think back to when your imagination could\u2026 could take you wherever you wanted to go. Imagine this universe slipping away, opening like a curtain. Allow the universe to pass right through you. Allow your imagination to take you to the other side.\nOLIVIA: James. James.\nJAMES HEATH: Help me.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what do we do?\nJAMES HEATH: Look... we made it.\nNICK LANE: We\u2019re on the other side\nOLIVIA: Okay, come on James. You've got to get up. We've got to hide now.\nSALLY CLARK: Oh Nick... Nick, I don't feel so good.\nWALTER: Through here.\nOLIVIA: Come on.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Go! Go! Go! Go!\nTEAM LEADER: Move! Move! Move!\nLINCOLN LEE: I want science and risk reports in three minutes.\nWALTER: Nick. Nick, make them leave.\nNICK LANE: I've been trying. It's not working. What's wrong with us?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nSALLY CLARK: Nick, I'm scared.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Check this out.\nLINCOLN LEE: Who the hell is Jackson?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Got a Junior?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah.\nLINCOLN LEE: Going to a strip club later?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Someone's got to visit your sister.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The paper's real. The detail is amazing. Why would someone go to this kind of trouble?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What in God's name did you all find?\nLINCOLN LEE: Nothing useful. Dead end so far.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Well, whatever it is you scanned just raised a red flag over at the D.O.D. The Secretary wants to see you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey, Charlie, you ever met him?\nAGENT FRANCIS: I shook his hand once when I graduated The Academy.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What about you?\nLINCOLN LEE: My dad knew him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, that explains so much.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah, you don't want to leak worms all over the guy. Makes a bad first impression.\nAGENT FRANCIS: They're not worms.\nMILITARY RECEPTIONIST: He's waiting for you. Go ahead in. Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Thank you. Agent Lee... I'm sorry about your father. He was a good man. Fine jurist.\nLINCOLN LEE: Thank you, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: And this is your team?\nLINCOLN LEE: Yes, sir. Agents Francis and Dunham.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I understand you're investigating a Fringe Event in Brooklyn.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's correct, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: And in this event, there was a casualty -- a man?\nLINCOLN LEE: That's correct, sir. So far, we haven't been able to...\nSECRETARY BISHOP: ...Agent, I believe that I may have insight into who that man is and where he was from. What I'm about to tell you is classified. But I think it's time you knew what you were dealing with. Agent Dunham, what can you tell me about the Fringe Division?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, I'll play. Uh... The Fringe Division is a special adjunct branch of the Department of Defense. It's primary focus are natural and environmental disasters that began in 1985 with the Zero Event at Reiden Lake.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: And what are these natural disasters?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: They're holes in the fabric of the universe, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: A-plus. And how do you know all this?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I know it because I read it in the Z.F.T. in 1995 when you wrote and published it.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Z.F.T. The natural decay of our world. What would you say if I told you that the Z.F.T. is a lie? Or a half-truth anyway? These tears are not natural. They are the work of man. These holes don't simply lead to nothing. There is something on the other side.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What?\nLINCOLN LEE: Another one.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Bravo.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Another what?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Another universe... a parallel Earth just like this, but slightly different. And it was their attempt to penetrate our world which created the pattern of destruction that we struggle with daily.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The twenty dollar bill was...\nSECRETARY BISHOP: ...from the other side, and so was he. And I suspect he didn't come alone. As you know, I am not a lover of war. But I have reason to believe that these invaders are anything but peaceful. They must be found, and they must be found quickly.\nLINCOLN LEE: We'll get them sir.\nSALLY CLARK: I'm burning up, Nick.\nNICK LANE: It'll be fine, baby.\nBUS DRIVER: Scan your I.D. lady.\nOLIVIA: Sorry. Uh, we're gonna have to walk.\nNICK LANE: Central Park is 59th Street - that's three miles from here.\nOLIVIA: Okay, then we better get started.\nPETER: Hi.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Hi. How are you feeling?\nPETER: I'm okay.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You've been asleep for three days. Your fath... Walter said you might feel a bit dizzy. Maybe you'd like to sit down.\nPETER: I'm okay.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You must be starving. I made some eggs and bacon. Do -- do you still like bacon? When you were a boy, we\u2026\nPETER: I love bacon.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Oh, Peter. Oh, I've missed you so much.\nSALLY CLARK: Oh.\nNICK LANE: Stop for a second.\nSALLY CLARK: It's fine. I'm fine. Let's go.\nNICK LANE: You've got to know something. What the hell is wrong with us?\nWALTER: Oh, I suspect that somehow the human circuit was flawed. Did any of you engage in extreme use of your abilities last night - far more than normal?\nNICK LANE: No.\nWALTER: Perhaps poor Mister Heath\u2026\nNICK LANE: You've got to help her.\nWALTER: I can't. But if we're lucky, perhaps William Bell can.\nSALLY CLARK: It's the Grand Hotel. They never built it.\nWALTER: Things that might have been in our world, but weren't.\nOLIVIA: Come on. It's not far.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Coffee's quite hard to come by over here. It's been rationed for some time now. But Walter's very well connected.\nPETER: It's funny, I.. I never had bacon when I was growing up. My mother was vegetarian, so she never made it. Until today, I always thought I imagined having it as a kid. I'm sorry... my mother from the other side. I'm sure you don't want to hear about that.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: No, on the contrary. I want to hear all about your childhood. What's-- are you close with her still? I mean... did she take good care of you?\nPETER: She took very good care of me. But she committed suicide about ten years ago. My mother from the other side\u2026 she was wonderful, but she wasn't strong. In fact, she was very, very sad... which I suppose is because of me.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: No, listen. Peter, in the end, we have to take responsibility for our own decisions - the good and the bad. Your father's going to be so pleased to see you.\nPETER: He had said he wanted me to help him with something.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yes, he's staying in the city tonight, but he asked me to give you this.\nSALLY CLARK: Oh, God. Look, Nick. These are my favorite. Can I get one?\nNICK LANE: I don't think so, baby. We got to go.\nSALLY CLARK: I - I like it here. Maybe -- maybe we can stay. Nick... I'm gonna stay.\nNICK LANE: I know, baby. I know. Come on, let's go. Do you see him? William Bell?\nWALTER: No.\nNICK LANE: There's a water fountain. Come on, I think it'll help.\nWALTER: Are we late?\nOLIVIA: Maybe he didn't get the message.\nNICK LANE: No.\nWALTER: Bell has betrayed us.\nOLIVIA: Run, run, run!\nSALLY CLARK: Oh!\nLINCOLN LEE: Don't move!\nOLIVIA: Walter. Walter!\nLINCOLN LEE: Nick?\nNICK LANE: I think I'm staying here.\nSALLY CLARK: You stay. We'll stay together.\nLINCOLN LEE: Look, I don't want to hurt you. Step away.\nSALLY CLARK: Screw you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey!\nRADIO MAN: Man down. Med Team to Grayshot Bridge. Man down.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln?\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey. Where's the ambulance?\nWALTER: Dizzy... must be the onset of hemorrhagic shock. But I'm still walking, so the bullet couldn't have hit my spinal column. I'll be perfectly fine. Excuse me.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (about the blueprints she gave him) Do you really understand all these?\nPETER: Maybe. I'm not sure yet.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Good night, Peter.\nPETER: Good night.\nFRANK STANTON: Hey.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh.\nFRANK STANTON: Mm. I tried to wait up.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, hi baby.\nFRANK STANTON: How is he?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, he's got third-degree burns over ninety percent of his body. He's gonna need three months in a Nanite Regeneration Chamber, but he'll live. I'm sorry - and on your last night.\nFRANK STANTON: I'm going for a week, not until the end of time.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. Details.\nFRANK STANTON: Might be a good day to start drinking.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, God. I would if I could only stand the taste.\nFRANK STANTON: So what happened out there?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Just a... small anomaly that set off a fuel cell. It was just bad luck of the draw is all. Come on, no more work.\nFRANK STANTON: I know what you need.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah? What's that?\nFRANK STANTON: Back rub.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, you are a god.\nFRANK STANTON: I'll get the oil.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Really? On your last night? Oh. I'll take it. Mm. Mm.\nWILLIAM BELL: Hello, Olivia. It's good to see you again.\nOLIVIA: How -- how did you know that I...\nWILLIAM BELL: ...I suspected you would come here.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so where were you at the park?\nWILLIAM BELL: I received Nina's message, but when I got to the park, it was too late. There was nothing I could do. My dear Olivia, I know you have good reason not to trust me. But I'm afraid you're going to have to. Walter is in trouble. And I'm quite confident we don't have much time."

Fringe Event 89722. An unstable wormhole at the Madison Square Garden that would not close was quarantined by Fringe Division in 1999. Due to recent legal developments, the 10,000 citizens encased in quarantine amber have been recently ruled legally dead. Liberty Island. Appropriated by the revised eminent domain provision of \u2018\u2019The Earth Protection Act\u2019\u2019 in 1989, now headquarters of the Department of Defense.\nMAJOR WARNER: Mister Secretary. You said anything odd, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Yes.\nMAJOR WARNER: Sir, Homeland Security received a report of a high-priority individual being admitted into the E.R. At New York General Hospital.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Who?\nMAJOR WARNER: That's the odd part, sir. It's you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's Sunday. Day off.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: 'fraid not. I'm uploading your assignment now. (later, to Mister Secretary) Team's on the way. We'll get them, sir, quickly and quietly.\nPETER: Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Hello, son. I've imagined this moment so many times. I can't imagine how strange it must be for you.\nPETER: I've seen the strange. But this... this is something else.\nWILLIAM BELL: This is the last hospital before the park. If we don't find Walter here, we'll start heading uptown.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, how do you know that he's not already in custody?\nWILLIAM BELL: I've checked with my sources at Homeland Security. I don't believe Walternate's people have found him yet.\nOLIVIA: \"Walternate\"?\nWILLIAM BELL: It's a nickname Walter gave him years ago. \"Walternate.\" over here, he's the Secretary of Defense. The Fringe Team answers to him.\nOLIVIA: To Walter?\nWILLIAM BELL: I know it takes a little getting used to, doesn't it?\nNURSE: Okay, we're gonna have to refer to the chart.\nWILLIAM BELL: Excuse me.\nNURSE: How big were the bees? This big? Bigger than a grapefruit?\nWILLIAM BELL: Excuse me.\nNURSE: Hey, pal! If you ain't bleeding, back of the line. Excuse me, sir, I-- I didn't realize.\nWILLIAM BELL: That's quite alright. I believe a friend of mine is being treated here.\nNURSE: What's the patient's name, please?\nOLIVIA: Bell.\nNURSE: Sir?\nWILLIAM BELL: You go. I'll buy you some time. You find Walter. I'll meet you in the parking lot. I'm sorry. A misunderstanding.\nNURSE: (to Bell) Okay. (to Francis) Give me a second. I'll find him for you.\nAGENT FRANCIS: We're also gonna need his medical files purged from the system. Fringe authorization.\nNURSE: I purged his file. He's in bed eighteen.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Thanks.\nWILLIAM BELL: Uh, excuse me, excuse me. Don't I know you from somewhere? I -- I have it. You're agents. Fringe Division. You work for the Secretary.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Sorry, sir, we're in a bit of a rush.\nWILLIAM BELL: I'd imagine you would be. Chaotic times, aren't they? Chaotic times indeed. I'm terribly sorry. The Secretary and I are old friends. I'm William Bell. I see you're carrying \u2018\u201976-Pulse\u2019\u2019 side arms. I designed those, you know.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, I'm sorry, Mister Bell, but we have to\u2026\nWILLIAM BELL: \u2026the \u2018\u201976\u2019\u2019 models don't have the phase repeater. That's a design flaw.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: Olivia. It is you, isn't it?\nOLIVIA: Yes, Walter.\nWALTER: Prove it.\nOLIVIA: Come on, Walter. We don't have time for this.\nWALTER: Ah... yes, it is you. That's wonderful. Hi.\nOLIVIA: Hi.\nWILLIAM BELL: They also don't have the pulse function. Which I am putting in the \u2018\u201977\u2019\u2019.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Excuse me, sir.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Walter, can you walk?\nWALTER: I can dance, if you like. They have absolutely fabulous drugs here, Olivia. I feel great. Oh, and look, look, look. Accelerated healing techniques. It -- it's miraculous.\nOLIVIA: Okay, come on, Walter. Bell's waiting for us.\nWALTER: Belly's here?\nOLIVIA: Yes. Yes, he is.\nWALTER: That's nice of him to finally show up.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Here. Clothes are gone.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: He was wounded.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I'll lock down the hospital.\nATTENDANT: Are you looking for something?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I need the security footage for this unit. Now.\nWALTER: Hello, William.\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter.\nWALTER: I see you've aged.\nWILLIAM BELL: It appears I'm not the only one.\nOLIVIA: Get in, Walter.\nWALTER: Ohh.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey. You okay? Looks like you just saw a ghost.\nPETER: Thank you. What's the red?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: That's the quarantine areas.\nPETER: Boston?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Most all of them. Because of what that man did. The man who stole you.\nPETER: That's a lot of blame to place on just one man.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It's true, I'm afraid. When our two universes first interacted, it caused soft spots on the other side. But it was much worse here. The laws of physics were turned into mere suggestions. But I'm hoping you can change all that.\nPETER: I don't know what you heard about me, but... changing the laws of physics might be slightly above my abilities.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: That's fair enough. But there have been break-throughs on the the other side in science and engineering that -- that we haven't achieved yet. And these are things that you understand. The schematic I left with your mother...?\nPETER: Yeah, I looked at them, and... whatever it is, it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. So what is it?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It's very old tech. It's something that... I believe can be applied to heal the problems of this world... of your world. I've replaced missing parts with new equipment, but, unfortunately, it still doesn't work. My engineers tell me that the problem probably lies in the power source. I was hoping that you would have a look at it.\nPETER: Of course I will.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Peter, I know it wasn't easy -- making the choice to come home. But I'm very glad you did.\nMAJOR WARNER: Sir, Agent Dunham is here. She doesn't have an appointment.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Tell her...\nPETER: ...Olivia's here?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Send her in. Agent Dunham.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: This is Peter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Thank you, Major.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Do I have something in my teeth?\nPETER: No, you remind me of somebody I know. But your hair is different. Think I like yours better.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Would you excuse us, please, Peter? I need to speak to Agent Dunham. I'll be out in a moment to show you around. Agent.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, we lost him at the hospital, sir. We think he had help escaping.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: That's not why you're here, is it?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, no, it is not.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I told you there would be invaders coming over from the other side, but I didn't tell you they would be us.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, you did not.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: They're our doubles, alternate version of ourselves, but don't be deceived, Olivia. They're monsters in our skin. They'll do anything, say anything to gain our trust, but they can't be trusted.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That man. He knows me. Or her. That's why he was staring at me. Is he from the other side?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: That man... is my son. Peter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Your son who was kidnapped twenty years ago?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Yes. Kidnapped by them. Agent... may I ask a favor of you?\nOLIVIA: They had cameras everywhere. We must be on the hospital surveillance tapes.\nWILLIAM BELL: Which means we are fugitives.\nWALTER: Double breaded for a big crunch. It's so good. Tastes just like on our side. It was Wednesday, 1983, when I happened to identify the last of the 11 secret herbs and spices.\nOLIVIA: Walter... okay. I think that we should split up. I can look for Peter faster if I'm on my own.\nWALTER: We have a larger problem. Without Mister Lane and the others, we won't be able to cross back to our side.\nWILLIAM BELL: Olivia can still open the door. That's her gift, is it not?\nWALTER: I don't know how much of a toll crossing over took on her. You may be able to open a crack, but without the others to enhance your power...\nWILLIAM BELL: ...that's it, then.\nWALTER: What?\nWILLIAM BELL: We need a doorstop. Something to hold the door open where Olivia has already provided a crack. You could build one, Walter.\nWALTER: A doorstop! No... no, no, no, no. For starters, I'd need a particle accelerator. I don't think they exactly sell those at the local drugstore.\nWILLIAM BELL: No. But I think I know where we could get one.\nWALTER: Oh! Oh, of course. I'm sure you opened Massive Dynamic On this side as well.\nWILLIAM BELL: As a matter of fact, I did not. I did not...\nWALTER: ...to get rich and famous while I was rotting away in a padded cell.\nWILLIAM BELL: Oh Walter, will you please...\nOLIVIA: ...hey! Come on, you can work this out another time. Okay, Walter... You build a doorstop, If you can. I'm gonna go look for Peter. Now do you have a cell phone?\nWILLIAM BELL: They monitor all the communications networks. That's probably how they knew about Central Park. It's safest if we don't try to communicate with one another. We'll meet back at the Opera House in twelve hours.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWILLIAM BELL: Be careful. We've accomplished a lot together, Walter. But she may be our greatest achievement.\nWALTER: Hmm.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The Secretary thinks you'll be comfortable here.\nPETER: Thanks.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So, uh, it's UV-proof glass. Uh, state-of-the-art anti-fire tech. There's viral purging, air filtration, and there's a gym and a pool upstairs. The Secretary's gonna send a car to pick you up at Eight, take you to dinner. What was it like on the other side? Secretary told me.\nPETER: A lot like it is here. Just... slightly different. It's subtle, but definitely different.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, when people find out that you're back... you're gonna be famous.\nPETER: What do you mean?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, your kidnapping. It's a famous story.\nPETER: So I'm like the Lindbergh Baby?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The what?\nPETER: Nothing.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's she like?\nPETER: Who?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Me.\nPETER: She's a lot like you. Darker in the eyes, maybe. She's always trying to make up for something. Right some imaginary wrong. Haunted, I guess. Maybe she's nothing like you at all. Thanks for the ride.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Of course.\n(Walter and William on the way to Harvard University)\nWALTER: Am I responsible for this?\nWILLIAM BELL: Yes, Walter. I'm afraid you are.\nWALTER: Oh. Of course.\nWILLIAM BELL: At one time, Walternate was intent on finding a means to cross between universes. Just as you were. He didn't succeed, but... it stands to reason the technology we need might be here.\nWALTER: Didn't Walternate work with you? Or, rather, the William Bell from this side?\nWILLIAM BELL: Walternate? No. It seems that William Bell on this side was killed in a car accident as a young man. Over here... the other you and the other me never had occasion to meet.\nWALTER: What a shame. Imagine how much money you could have made if there were two of you.\nWILLIAM BELL: Creating Massive Dynamic was not my idea, Walter. We both talked about borrowing this world's technologies to help our own.\nWALTER: You didn't help the world, William. You helped yourself. You pilfered this world for profit.\nWILLIAM BELL: As a by-product, yes. Let's remember, the only reason I came back over here was to prevent a war. And to stop a chain of events set into motion the day you stole Peter!\nWALTER: A little truth, if you please. You say you want to prevent the war while you quietly fuel it. I know that you helped craft the shape-shifters. Your design signature is all over it.\nWILLIAM BELL: I had little choice. If I wanted to keep tabs on Walternate, I had to remain valuable to him.\nWALTER: I've lost... seventeen years in a mental institution, William. Seventeen years! And even now, I'm -- I'm still incomplete. I forget things. Uh, names. Places. Connections that I used to be able to make so easily. They just -- they just dangle, just outside of my reach. I know what you did to me. I know that you cut out pieces of my brain.\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter...\nWALTER: ...what kind of man could do that? You robbed me of my memories of my wife, of my son, of my past!\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter! I believe you've found what we're looking for.\nWALTER: We should get started.\nWILLIAM BELL: Hmm.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How did you...?\nOLIVIA: ...we both leave our hide-a-key in the same place.\nWILLIAM BELL: This should do. With some modifications, this should act as a doorstop.\nWALTER: Now, we need to simultaneously amplify and limit the molecular destabilization margins.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, we should try not to electrocute everyone in the process.\nWALTER: Well... this will reopen the crack in the door. But without the others, I'm not sure that Olivia will be strong enough to keep it open.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well... leave that to me.\nOLIVIA: Now, I need your help.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, you have a funny way of asking.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I need you to take me to Peter Bishop. I assume that you know where he is. Don't.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's getting heavy.\nOLIVIA: Is that mom?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: She's alive? What is she like?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, the last few years have been hard for her. My sister died during childbirth. You have a sister too?\nOLIVIA: And a niece. Ella. She's seven.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Ella.\nOLIVIA: I need to speak to Peter Bishop. He's in danger here, and he needs to understand that.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: This isn't just an assignment, is it? Are you two a couple? Is that what this is about?\nOLIVIA: Please, I need to speak to him. You gotta trust me. I'm you.\nWALTER: You haven't answered my question.\nWILLIAM BELL: What question?\nWALTER: Why did you remove my memories?\nWILLIAM BELL: I had my reasons.\nWALTER: Belly...\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter... Let the past be the past. We have less than four hours to get back. We should go.\nOLIVIA: Will you help me?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Stop. Stop.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I was just getting my keys.\nOLIVIA: Put it down.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You keep your backup gun in your purse, don't you? I keep mine in my jacket.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Now put your gun slowly down on the table.\nOLIVIA: I thought we had an agreement.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, I don't know what you are, but you are nothin' like me. You know, he was right. Call Fringe. This is Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Uhh!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uhh! Uhh!\nOLIVIA: Uhh!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uhh!\nOLIVIA: Uhh! Unh! Uhh!\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, Liv. I tried your Cuff a couple of times. Everything okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. What's up, Charlie?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Got a power surge at the Secretary's old lab. So Broyles wants us to go and check it out. You sure you're okay?\nOLIVIA: The Secretary just called. He, uh, he wants us to move Peter Bishop. Apparently, he's not safe where he is.\nAGENT FRANCIS: They found Peter Bishop?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Huh.\n(In the safe house)\nPETER: Object is totally unresponsive. But there's nothing wrong with it. There's no... obvious damage to the structure. And yet... somehow it just feels incomplete. Alright, this is gonna sound crazy. In fact... this is kind of crazy. But what if... the object was symbiotic in nature? Which is to say that it wasn't entirely mechanical, that it needed some sort of... some sort of... organic interface?\n(Agent Francis and Olivia on their way to Peter)\nAGENT FRANCIS: So how much do you know? How did they find him?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Wow. After all these years. Can you imagine when the tabloids get hold of this?\nOLIVIA: You know, I think it has something to do with why these people have come from the other side.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah, I suppose so.\nOLIVIA: Have we got any new leads?\nAGENT FRANCIS: No, nothing new. I gotta tell you, Livvy, this job isn't what it was ten years ago. You\u2019ve got alternate universes. I mean, it just -- just wasn't part of my training, you know? I mean, how are we supposed to fight these people? Truth is, Livvy, this makes me feel obsolete, you know?\nPETER: The parameters are human... a reflection of the human genome. The spectrum isn't random. In fact, the specificity of the configuration would seem to suggest that the object would only respond to a subset of people. And a narrow subset at that. A subset of one. Me.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Charlie Francis.\nPETER: Peter Bishop. It's a pleasure to meet you. Come on in. What can I do for you guys?\nOLIVIA: Uh, Mister Bishop, we're concerned for your safety.\nPETER: What's this?\nOLIVIA: This was given to me by an acquaintance of your father. An Observer.\nPETER: An Observer?\nOLIVIA: He gave it to me, I think, to warn me about what would happen to you if you ever returned here.\nAGENT FRANCIS: What's going on?\nOLIVIA: He wants you to know that your friends are here and that they have come to keep you safe.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, Liv, what the hell are you talking about?\nOLIVIA: Oh, God. Peter, it's me.\nPETER: Thanks, I think I just figured that out.\nPETER: He lied to me. He told me I could heal the problems of this world. My father told me that all the problems out there started when Walter came over and stole me. And that, now that I was back, I was gonna be able to help to fix it. But his bringing me back was never about fixing this universe. It was about destroying yours.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry.\nPETER: How long did you know?\nOLIVIA: A few weeks. Peter, I...\nPETER: ...don't worry. I'm not gonna let them do this.\nOLIVIA: I don't think that he can. I mean, not without you. Peter... you don't belong here.\nPETER: No, I don't belong here. But I don't belong there, either.\nOLIVIA: Yes, you do. I have thought of one hundred reasons... why you should come back. To -- to fight the shape-shifters, to take care of Walter, to -- to save the world. But in the end... you have to come back. Because you belong with me. (she approaches him and they kiss)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (marching from the elevator) Colonel Broyles, listen up. I need everyone's attention, now!\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I want all surveillance retasked to find a fugitive.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What fugitive, sir?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Me.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I've got her - her \u2018\u2019Show-Me\u2019\u2019 just passed the auto scan checkpoint at Sector 47.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: They're heading back to the Opera House.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Alright, people, let's move. This is not a drill.\nWALTER: They should be here by now.\nWILLIAM BELL: They'll be here. Help me get this thing inside. Walter!\nWALTER: Oh, okay.\n(Olivia and Peter drive-up, park near the theater and exit the car)\nWILLIAM BELL: Hello, Peter. I'm William Bell. Haven't seen you in many years. You're holding up better than I would have thought.\nPETER: What's a little universe hopping between friends?\nWILLIAM BELL: That's not what I meant.\nOLIVIA: (as sirens sound and vehicles arrive) Okay, so what do we do?\nWILLIAM BELL: Peter, help your father get this device inside and powered up. Olivia and I will hold them off. (the Bishops take the accelerator inside. agents exit their vehicles and Bell retrieves a weapon from his car. to Olivia) I supplied Fringe Division with the \u2018\u201976 model\u2019\u2019. (he shoots a vehicle and it explodes) This is the \u2018\u201977\u2019\u2019. Come on.\nWALTER: (preparing the equipment inside the theater) Peter, I don't even know where to begin. I never meant for any of this to happen.\nPETER: How do we do this, Walter?\nWILLIAM BELL: (outside. defending the theater) Phosphorous grenades. Be careful. They're prototypes. They could be unstable.\nOLIVIA: (takes the grenades) What do you mean, unstable?\nWILLIAM BELL: Just try not to jostle them. (as gunfire erupts around them) Cover me. (Olivia provides covering fire with her pistol)\n(inside. the Bishops activate the accelerator)\nTEAM LEADER: Ready? (to his assault as they prepare to attack the theater) We move on my mark.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (standing behind cover with Bolivia Dunham, they listen to lengthy instructions on their earpieces) Yes, Mister Secretary. I understand. (the two agents nod after the instructions and she heads off on a task away from the firefight)\nOLIVIA: (runs out of ammunition) Damn it. (prepares a grenade) Doctor Bell! (sees Bolivia standing behind them) Get down!\n(inside, the Bishops see and hear a large flash from the street where the battle was occurring)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (standing over the groggy scientist as he regains his senses) Doctor Bell. Can you hear me? Doctor Bell. Ohh. Thank God.\nWILLIAM BELL: (as she helps him up) What happened?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (all the nearby vehicles are damaged, burning, and the gunfire has stopped) Uhh. I, uh... I used a grenade. I think I bought us a few minutes. Come on.\nPETER: (as they are joined inside the building) Walter, they're here.\nWILLIAM BELL: Is it working?\nWALTER: Yes. It's opening a crack in the door, but we don't have enough power to keep it open.\nWILLIAM BELL: Yes, we can do it.\nWALTER: We can't. Olivia doesn't have the power, and -- and I haven't thought of a solution.\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter\u2026\nWALTER: \u2026please don't argue with me, William! Not now. Always thinking you're smarter than me.\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter, I will be the power. I've travelled between universes so many times, my atoms are ready to split apart with the slightest provocation. You taught me there are as many atoms in the human body as there are stars in the sky. That's how many atom bombs I am. That should be enough power to get you home.\nWALTER: I should never have doubted you.\nWILLIAM BELL: It's okay, Walter. You always were as stubborn as a donkey with a nail in his head. Walter, start the sequence.\nWALTER: Thank you, old friend. (a glimmering sphere starts to form around them)\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter... You asked me why I took out part of your brain. I did it because you asked me to. Because of what you were becoming.\nFRINGE AGENT: (entering from outside) Freeze!\n(the glimmering sphere expands and brightens. Walter, Peter and Bolivia pass into this universe)\nBROYLES: (walks to stage where his team has reappeared) Welcome back.\n(at Olivia's apartment, Bolivia Dunham finds the spare key that Olivia hides. she entersm turns on the lights and looks around the suite of rooms. nobody is there)\n(Gene moos. Astrid feeds Peter)\nPETER: Seriously? This is the third piece, Astrid. Are you trying to kill me?\nASTRID: I'm sorry. When I'm nervous, I cook. And I've been baking pies for about a week. Pies and muffins and cakes. And I've been eating them all too, so don't be surprised when I send you a bill for my lap-band.\nPETER: I'm sorry I made you nervous.\nASTRID: That's okay. At least you're back.\nPETER: You mind giving Walter a ride home? I think I'm gonna take a walk.\nASTRID: Sure.\nPETER: Good night, Walter.\nWALTER: Peter... you are back now, aren't you? You're -- you're not leaving again?\nPETER: I'm trying to see this your way, Walter. I can't. But... you did cross universes twice to save my life. So that's gotta count for something, right?\nWALTER: Thank you Peter. My son.\nSTORE OWNER: Help you, gorgeous?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I hope so. I'm looking for a typewriter.\nSTORE OWNER: Well, you're in luck.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: A Selectric. Model 251.\nSTORE OWNER: I see. It's in the back.\n(she heads to the back room. sits and types a message... INFILTRATION ACHIEVED. AWAITING ORDERS. the reply comes quickly)\n(Secretary Bishop walks the length of a dark corridor and approaches a window. he raises the protectve blind on the window and turns-on the light. Olivia sits in the holding cell, then becomes agitated when she sees her captor)\nOLIVIA: Please let me out of here. I know you can hear me! Please... please let me out of here. (he studies her quietly) I know you can hear me! Please let me out of here! No, no, no. (as he drops the blinds) No! No! No!"

What is happening to you, given the nature of your job, the upsetting events you come in contact with on a regular basis, coupled with the injury to your head... It's not surprising your mind has created this fantasy... a means of processing the trauma.\nOLIVIA: This is not a fantasy.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: You agree you are an agent with Fringe Division.\nOLIVIA: I work for the FBI in Fringe Division... dealing with weird and mysterious events that threaten the safety of the United States and its residents.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Good. (picks up a photo and shows it to Olivia) Is this your mother?\nOLIVIA: She looks like her, but it isn't her.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: And these? (shows Olivia two more photos) Agent Lincoln Lee, Charlie Francis... are these your partners?\nOLIVIA: No.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: And who is this? (shows another photo)\nOLIVIA: Another Olivia Dunham. The Olivia Dunham from over here.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: And how does that sound to you, Olivia... What you're saying that there's a world beyond this world populated with people who look exactly like the people here?\nOLIVIA: It sounds preposterous, which is what I thought when I first learned about it, but as insane as it sounds, it's the truth.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Who's Peter? After you were injured outside the opera house, when you were under anesthesia, you mumbled the name \"Peter.\" Is he one of your friends? The ones who came here with you from the other universe?\nOLIVIA: Peter is my colleague, a civilian consultant. My team and I crossed over here to find him and bring him home.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: And where are they now... Peter and your friends?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. But I assume they had to go home without me.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Olivia, I know it's really scary... not being in control of one's own mind.\nOLIVIA: Doctor Anderson... I am not crazy. That is not my mother. My mother died when I was fourteen. The Charlie Francis that I knew was murdered. I have never won an olympic medal for marksmanship. None of these are me. This is not my life.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: You think I'm trying to convince you you're someone you're not? Why would I do that?\nOLIVIA: I don't know\nBRANDON: You wanted to see me, sir?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: The treatments are not working.\nBRANDON: Well, that's, uh, not such a surprise. We always knew that transferring memories was a long shot at best.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Let's try again, please.\nBRANDON: Sir, if we give her another dose, it could kill her.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You and I know something that many lives and many more dollars have been spent to keep secret that we are at war... at war with another universe populated by creatures who have damaged the very fabric of reality. All around us, our world is under attack. Somehow, this girl came here. Somehow, she is equipped to move through universes. We need her to help us understand this skill because if we can do it, we can win this war. And if not, soon, there'll be nothing left to protect. Let's try again.\nOLIVIA: Is it dinner already?\nSOLDIER: Afraid not.\nOLIVIA (strapped down): Please... Please don't do this again. (A scientist injects a blue liquid into her. When he is about to inject another (white) substance) I don't feel so good. (Olivia gasps) I can't... can't breathe.\nBRANDON: Unstrap her. Sit her up. (Olivia attacks the two scientists and made a run)\nCode blue. Code blue.\nSOLDIERS (running after Olivia): Freeze!\nOLIVIA: Come on! Come on!\nSOLDIERS: Hold it right there! Hold it right there!\n(Siren goes off, soldiers chasing after Olivia)\nSOLDIERS: I see her! Over there!\nBROADCAST: The White House announced that President Obama has chosen former President John F. Kennedy to lead the government's new agency aimed at slowing ecological breakdown. President Kennedy plans to step down from his role as U.N. Ambassador.\nOLIVIA (gets in the taxi): Drive.\nHENRY HIGGINS: I'm gonna need you to Show Me. You know I can't put this cab into drive without your I.D.\nOLIVIA (points a gun): What's your name?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Henry.\nOLIVIA: Okay, listen, Henry. What I need you to do right now is I need you to drive.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Okay.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: No, sir. Not yet. Shore patrol says there's no way she could have made it across that the currents are impossible this time of year.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What do you think?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I think from what I know of Olivia Dunham. She's the one person I would bet on who could survive.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Then find her.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Why are you wearing a hospital gown? Are you sick?\nOLIVIA: I've been held against my will and I'm being pursued by a division of the government. They've done experiments on me. They're trying to convince me that I'm someone that I'm not. (looks at the photograph) Is that your family?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Look, I'm just getting my life back together. I don't know what you're doing, but the last thing I need now is any kind of trouble.\nOLIVIA: You're not in any trouble, Henry... As long as you do exactly as I say. Okay, I want you to slow down Just up here and park. (Car stopped) Give me your I.D. Your \"show me.\" (Olivia checks Henry's information on Show Me) Okay, you're gonna go into that store and you're gonna buy me some clothes. I now know where you and your family live. If you alert anyone, Henry, I assure you trouble will find you.\nHENRY HIGGINS: I understand.\nOLIVIA: Good.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Knock, knock.\nLINCOLN LEE: Who's there?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Uh, no one, 'cause you're so ugly, no one would come to your door.\nLINCOLN LEE: Ha ha. (to Melissa) Hey, Melissa, you know how Agent Francis can tell which end of the worms living inside his body are which? Tickles them in the middle and sees which end farts. (Melissa laughs) Boom.\nMELISSA: I'll get you some water, Lincoln.\nLINCOLN LEE: So... what have you heard? How much longer are they gonna keep her there?\nAGENT FRANCIS: You know Olivia. She's strong. Physically, she's doing a lot better. But they're saying she had a complete psychotic break.\nLINCOLN LEE: I've heard of people losing time, you know? Not being able to remember the day leading up to a bad car accident. But this is crazy. And the other Olivia?\nAGENT FRANCIS: She escaped to the other side, along with the Secretary's son and the other Walter Bishop.\nLINCOLN LEE: You know, three days ago, I was eating a bowl of chocolate ice cream. I was watching Tom Cruise kick some ass on TV. I thought, 'life's pretty good'. Now all of this.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'm afraid it's just gotten worse.\nLINCOLN LEE: Sir.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: How you coming along?\nLINCOLN LEE: I'm doing okay. What is it?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Last night Agent Dunham escaped from the facility on Liberty Island.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Nice ink. What's it mean?\nOLIVIA: What?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Tattoo on the back of your neck. Looks like a sun of some kind.\nOLIVIA: They must have done it to me. She must have one. The other one must have a tattoo.\nHENRY HIGGINS: The girl they're trying to make you believe you are?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah, that sounds right. I agree.\nOLIVIA: Hey, don't do that. Don't placate me because you think that I'm--\nHENRY HIGGINS: What? Crazy? And what would you think if I jacked your cab in a hospital gown with a gun, screaming a conspiracy, telling you I'm being chased by the government and folks are trying to make me believe I'm a tattooed version of myself.\nOLIVIA: Look, I know I sound insane.\nHENRY HIGGINS: A little bit.\nOLIVIA: Well, I'm not insane. I'm not who they say I am.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Okay. So where we going?\nOLIVIA: You're taking me home.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I don't have to tell you a delusional Fringe Division agent with sensitive, classified information is of great concern.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Do you have any idea where she's gone?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Not yet. Considering her mental state, she could be anywhere. (To Lincoln) Where you going?\nLINCOLN LEE: To get my clothes.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Not you.\nLINCOLN LEE: If Olivia's in trouble, I'm not sitting here.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I thought you had to go back to the hyperbaric chamber.\nLINCOLN LEE: I can be out for eight hours at a time. I got six hours left today. (To Melissa) Melissa. Get my nanite wraps.\nOLIVIA: If I'm not back in 15 minutes, you can leave.\nHENRY HIGGINS: The opera house? That's where your home is?\nOLIVIA: No, but that's how I got here, and that's how I'm gonna get back there.\nHENRY HIGGINS: What's to stop me from leaving now?\nOLIVIA (chuckles): Henry Arliss Higgins. 3248 Hastings Avenue, Apartment 3. I.D. Number 10-02-25-056768. Blood Type, \"B\" negative. Your inoculations are up to date except for your typhus, which is 17 days overdue. You might want to get that taken care of.\n(Olivia approaches the Opera House)\nPOLICE OFFICER: Hey! Hey! Agent Dunham, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I wasn't aware that the Fringe Division was overseeing this.\nOLIVIA: Oh, uh, it's okay. I should have I.D.'d myself.\nPOLICE OFFICER: So is it, uh, true what they say about this place? People have disappeared into thin air inside? I know, I know. Classified. Things keep getting weirder and weirder all the time.\nOLIVIA: If you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna--\nPOLICE OFFICER: Yeah, you know, we should--we should step back.\nOLIVIA: I-I-I'll only be a minute.\nPOLICE OFFICER: No, no. There's no time for that. The protocol's already in effect.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I understand...\nPOLICE OFFICER: Agent, Agent, you can't.\nOLIVIA: No.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Anything yet?\nLINCOLN LEE: Agent Farnsworth is running scenarios.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: There's a 6% chance that Agent Dunham will return to headquarters to surrender. An 11% chance that she will return to attack. A 21% chance that she will attempt to contact someone that she knows. A 29% chance that she will return to the theater where her trauma occurred. And a 33% chance that she will attempt to leave the country.\nFRANCIS & LEE: Someone contact the borders?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Yea.\nLINCOLN LEE: She's good at disguises.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I've told them that too.\nFRINGE DIVISION AGENT: Agent Dunham just left the Orpheum Theater quarantine in a city taxi.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Get a line on the tracker in that cab and find it.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yes, sir.\nHENRY HIGGINS: So... what now?\nOLIVIA: I don't know yet. Can you just keep driving?\nHENRY HIGGINS: (phone rings) It's my wife.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Don't do anything foolish, Henry.\nHENRY HIGGINS: (to wife) Hey. Yeah, yeah. I know. I never put it in there. It was in Laura's old room. Laura's--yeah. Nothing. I-I got a fare. Okay. Around 7:00? I love you, hon. For sure.\nOLIVIA: What's her name?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Jasmine. Unless I'm in the doghouse then she's \"Honey.\" So most of the time, it's \"honey.\" (Olivia chuckles) What about you? You got someone?\nOLIVIA: Sort of.\nHENRY HIGGINS: That's an odd name... \"sort of.\"\nOLIVIA: His name is Peter. He's sort of the reason I'm here. Can you take me to 655 18th street, Just off 10th avenue?\nHENRY HIGGINS: What's there?\nOLIVIA: It's a company called Massive Dynamic.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Never heard of it.\nOLIVIA: They make technology that could get me home. If I'm right, there's a lady who works there who may be able to help me.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Well, if we're going down to Chelsea, we're gonna need some gas.\n(Olivia and Henry stop for some gas. Olivia takes the car key.)\nOLIVIA: Remember.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah, I know. I know. You got my number. Jedi mind trick.\n(Olivia enters a restroom and starts sobbing.)\nLINCOLN LEE: Hey, Liv. Thank god we found you.\nLINCOLN LEE: Okay. I know I'm not quite my handsome self, But a hello would be nice. I know about the shootout at the Orpheum. Colonel Broyles told me all about it. You know, you took a blow to your head--\nOLIVIA: Don't you come any closer.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv, I'm going through it myself. Believe me, I know that the treatment can feel worse than the disease... But they're just trying to fix you. We all just want to help you get bet-- (Olivia points a gun) Liv?\nOLIVIA: Take your gun out and put it on the ground.\nLINCOLN LEE: Olivia, come on. I've been your partner for two years.\nOLIVIA: Put your gun on the ground.\nLINCOLN LEE: This isn't necessary.\nOLIVIA: Kick it over here.\nLINCOLN LEE: What do you think I'm gonna do?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I don't know you. Whatever they told you, I am not who you think I am.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv, think about what you're doing. You can't just keep running.\n(Olivia directs Lincoln in the restroom and blocks the door)\nOLIVIA (To Henry): Get in the car. Get in the car! Drive.\nHENRY HIGGINS: What are you doing?\nOLIVIA: Just drive!\nAGENT FRANCIS: Liv!\nOLIVIA: Go, go, go, go.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey!\nHENRY HIGGINS: You're a hell of a shot.\nOLIVIA: No, actually, I'm not.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Well, you could have fooled me.\nOLIVIA: Hey, what are you doing?\nHENRY HIGGINS: They won't be able to find us now.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: She must have removed the cab's tracker. We've tapped into the surveillance cams but we haven't picked anything up yet.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Did you see the incident footage?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Yes, sir.\n(Secretary Bishop and Colonel Broyles watch Olivia shooting the gas tank)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You know what I'm thinking?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: That there's only one person at Fringe Division who could make a shot like that.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It's working.\nOLIVIA: Why'd you pull over?\nHENRY HIGGINS: This is it. 18th street, 10th avenue-- that's where you said.\nOLIVIA: Oh, no.\nHENRY HIGGINS: What?\nOLIVIA: It's not here. They must never have built it.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Okay, maybe you got the cross streets wrong. Let me look it up.\nOLIVIA: I'm stuck here.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Shadowgrove circle... 302 shadowgrove circle. It's in tarrytown. I-it's a... it's a safe house. Walter must have told me about it. I don't know why I forgot.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Tarrytown's about 40 minutes from here.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we better get going.\n(Charlie visits Frank in his apartment)\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, Frank.\nFRANK STANTON: Charlie, what's up? Do you have news about Olivia?\nAGENT FRANCIS: You mind if I come in?\nFRANK STANTON: Come in.\n(back on the road)\nHENRY HIGGINS: He obviously means a lot to you.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me?\nHENRY HIGGINS: The guy you mentioned, why you say you came here.\n(Olivia chuckles)\nOLIVIA: Frank? Yeah.\nHENRY HIGGINS: I thought you said his name was Peter.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Peter.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Right. You don't look so good.\nOLIVIA: How long 'til we get there?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Not long.\nFRANK STANTON: I haven't slept since this whole thing happened. I don't even know what's wrong with her. Nobody will even give me a straight answer.\nAGENT FRANCIS: We're gonna get her better. I promise you. We just... we just got to find her. Can you think of something that, uh, we might have missed. You know, um, someone else she could have gone to for help. Someplace she could be hiding out, A friend, anything?\nFRANK STANTON: Marilyn is back in town.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I thought she was in France.\nFRANK STANTON: She came home when she heard what happened.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You know, the last time I ran a fare out this far, the meter read about 300 bucks. Guess I'll just put it on your tab. I can wait for you if you like.\nOLIVIA: No, you go home to your family.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You gonna be okay?\nOLIVIA: I'm not crazy, you know. But to prove that to you I'd have to tell you some things that were even crazier.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You know, a few years ago, I was in a bad way. Couldn't pull myself out. Inside, I knew I was somebody else. There's only one person who believed that... Jasmine. She saw the man I knew I was. But she was the only one. I mean, sometimes you just got to believe what you can't see.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(Olivia tries the doorbell but did not get a response. She goes in the house through the window.)\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Olive?\nOLIVIA: Mom.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: (rushing to hug her daughter) Sweetheart. Oh! I know what happened. They told me about your breakdown. I came home as soon as I heard. I tried to see you, but they wouldn't let me. Sweetheart, I've been so scared.\nOLIVIA: I'm not your daughter. My mother died when I was 14 years old. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be here.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Sweetheart!\nOLIVIA: Don't you call me that. I am not your daughter.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Yes, you are. You're just confused.\nOLIVIA: (angered) This was going to be my way home.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: This is your home.\nOLIVIA: No, my home is in Jacksonville, Florida. I was -- I was brought up on an Army Base. I've never been here before!\nMARILYN DUNHAM: If you've never been here, how did you know to come here?\nOLIVIA: I helped you paint, didn't I?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Yes. You picked the colors. I wanted blue, but you convinced me to use --\nOLIVIA: (smiling at the memory) Yellow, because it was more cheerful.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Sweetheart... this is your home. This is your safe house. Oh.\nAGENT FRANCIS: (after knocking on the front door) Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Dunham, just um, wondering if you heard from Olivia.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: She's here.\nAGENT FRANCIS: She is?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Come on in.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (in his office. debriefing the recapture with his medical expert) Olivia Dunham has been recovered. It appears that your treatments have taken effect after all. Your plan was sound. They just needed a bit more time than you assumed.\nBRANDON: No, it wasn't time. It was the adrenaline from her escape. The adrenaline triggered our Olivia's Memory \"B\" Lymphocytes.It carried them across the blood-brain barrier and successfully transferred the memories, which means for all intents and purposes... she is our Olivia now.\n(Agent Francis drives Olivia from Bolivia's mom's home as Henry Higgins watches from nearby in his parked cab. Satisfied, Higgins drives in another direction)\nOLIVIA: (as they drive) Thanks, Charlie.\nAGENT FRANCIS: For what?\nOLIVIA: For being my friend.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, Liv?\nOLIVIA: Yeah?\nAGENT FRANCIS: (joking) Thank you for not shooting me.\nOLIVIA: Aw. (both laugh)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (on video conference monitor) Give her the weekend. After that, she should be fine to go to work.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Then I assume this is the time to ask you - why? Why convince her she's our Olivia Dunham? Why is it necessary?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You don't need to worry about that just yet. You'll know soon enough.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: With due respect Mister Secretary, you're embedding one of them on my team, and you've embedded my agent with them. I need to know now.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Good work today, Phillip.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: And that's what you call him -- Walternate-- your real father?\nPETER: Yeah.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Okay, go on.\nPETER: Well, Walternate took me over there because he said he needed me to help him fix the damage on the other side.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: But you believed he was lying to you.\nPETER: Yeah, he--he never had any intention to -- to fix the other side. He wanted me to help him destroy ours.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Hmm.\nPETER: \"hmm,\" what?\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Pen's dying.\nPETER: Here, give it to me. I know a trick.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: A trick... to save a dying pen?\nPETER: Do you want me to fix it or not?\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Ah, it's okay. We're almost finished here. I just have one more question. Um, you said when you learned Walternate was lying to you, your first thought was anger, that you wanted to put a stop to his agenda. But you could have done that by staying there. So the one thing I don't understand is... why'd you come back?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, I haven't seen those in a while... your shoes.\nWALTER: Wallabees.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Are you bringing them back?\nWALTER: Where did they go? Oh, good. He's done.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How was it?\nPETER: It was endless, but it's over now. We can get on with our lives.\nWALTER: That's great. How about we start with dinner? I'm starving.\nPETER: And the whole time I was in there, there was only one thing I could think about.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah? What?\n(Peter and Bolivia kiss)\nPETER: That. Let's go. I'm sure tomorrow will bring the usual insanity. May as well enjoy a night off."

Joe fiddles with the toolkit looking for a pick-axe. He stands up and turns to the family he and his accomplices have bound and gagged. He turns on the television for them to watch. downstairs, his fellow criminals toil digging a hole)\nDARRYL: (standing in a deep hole in the basement) You know, we'd get through this foundation a lot quicker with that pick-axe. Where's your dumb cousin?\nBLAKE: He ain't dumb. And don't worry about him. Just keep working. (begins shoveling)\nDARRYL: (after finding a metal box in the soil and climbing out of the hole) What do you think's in it?\nBLAKE: Ain't our job to think. It's our job to dig.\nDARRYL: We're getting paid a lot of money for this. It's got to be something valuable.\nBLAKE: That's exactly the kind of thinking that found us trouble in Texas.\nDARRYL: Yeah? (studies the box) We made a lot of money back in Texas.\nBLAKE: Maybe just a peek.\n(the lightbulb above their heads shatters as they open the large black box. both men go into a trance and begin to bleed from the nose and ears. Joe returns to the basement, finds his crew and panics. he closes the box, runs upstairs, finds the family in a zombie-like trance and bleeding from the head. Joe flees the house with the box)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I have everything you need for your new identity right here. Agent Olivia Dunham joined the Fringe Division September 9th, 2008. And you also got files on both Bishops, Broyles, Bell, and Farnsworth.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Where did you get this?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I've been over here since you were in high school, and I've cultivated a lot of resources. Anything you need, just ask.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: A history of pop culture.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: That's your homework. It'll help familiarize you with this world. If you can move your hair to the side.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Now don't worry. You won't feel a thing.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Who's \"Bone-o\"?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Oh, it's Bono, actually. He's a musician.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, yeah. Is he any good?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: One of the few I like on this side.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, he's easy on the eyes.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Careful. Their side may be alluring, but don't be taken in by it. They started the war. Remember?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You don't have to remind me whose side I'm on. Did you do what I told you to do?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I hired a team and sent it to the site, yes.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Your usual men?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: No. I don't want to burn my resources. Does that meet with your approval?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't care how long you've been here. This is my operation. You work for me.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Indeed.\nASTRID: Doctor Bell's company was known for tackling the most advanced technological problems. He will long be remembered as one of our country's leading visionaries.\nWALTER: It's a bit generic, don't you think? He was my best friend. Wherever he is, he'll be very disappointed. We're low on butter.\nASTRID: Butter? Right. Coming up.\nBROYLES: And you think this is what, some sort of doomsday machine?\nPETER: Well, Walternate said that it was a very powerful piece of ancient tech. He spent the last few years looking for the machine's component pieces.\nBROYLES: But he's finished assembling it?\nPETER: No. He was missing several of them. Including one very important one. Me.\nBROYLES: You think this is accurate? That you somehow can power this device?\nPETER: The device seems to need a specific human interface, and this piece responded directly to me.\nBROYLES: If that's true, if Walternate needs you to operate this weapon --\nPETER: We know that he has agents on this side. If he wanted me back, I think they would have made a play already. There has to be some other plan.\nWALTER: Peter, these cacao beans, they're inedible. Gene will never be able to digest them.\nPETER: She's a cow, Walter. She could probably digest the frying pan.\nBROYLES: What is he doing?\nPETER: Oh, you don't want to know.\nWALTER: I'm trying to make chocolate milk. Or rather, I'm trying to make the cow make chocolate milk.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, do you have any idea why this machine would or could be configured for Peter, why it would respond to him?\nWALTER: I know that this machine is dangerous.\nBROYLES: Which is why we need to understand it. If it is indeed a threat --\nWALTER: ...then to ignore it would be irresponsible. I've heard that argument before. That's what you people told Oppenheimer when you discovered that the Nazis were working on a bomb. And how do you think he slept after his little invention had killed hundreds of thousands in a fraction of a second? I need to go back to the market. Aspirin, we need to go to the market.\nBROYLES: Is he okay?\nPETER: Well, he's Walter. Define \"okay.\"\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey.\nWALTER: Do you need anything at the market?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, thank you.\nBROYLES: Peter, I know you and Walter have been through a lot, but if this is the threat we think it is, we need Walter focused.\nPETER: What if he's right? What if we shouldn't be working on this thing? You ready?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We've been back for two days, and Walter's already driving you to drink?\nPETER: Do you blame me? Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in one of those bad buddy cop movies. Like I'm handcuffed to a...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: ...to a mad scientist who kidnapped you from another universe?\nPETER: Yeah. Exactly.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, I understand Walter's concern about the weapon, but I think that Broyles is right.\nBARTENDER: Another?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We need to figure out what it does, and can't do that without Walter. I love this song.\nPETER: Really?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Don't you?\nPETER: No, it's a great song. I just... as long as I've known you, I've never heard you express an interest in music.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh. I've been noticing a lot of things since we've been back. I guess being over there and meeting another Olivia Dunham has made me think about the way I look at the world, the choices I've made. Come on.\nPETER: Are you serious?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, come on. What, are you one of those guys who doesn't like to dance?\nPETER: No. I guess there's nothing like seeing another version of yourself to give you a little perspective. I've got to tell you, it was strange... being with the other you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh.\nPETER: It was like looking into one of those carnival mirrors.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What, you didn't like the red hair?\nPETER: Well, I've always preferred blondes. But you did make a very sexy redhead.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Good.\nPETER: The more I think about being over there, the less real it seems. But you, you still feel real.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: The neighbor found 'em a few hours ago. M.E. puts the time of death around ten last night.\nPETER: What are you thinking?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Nothing. Just taking it in.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, any thoughts?\nWALTER: Reminds me of Monet's Water lilies.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The painting?\nPETER: It's a pastel. Look at the blood. It's a shade lighter than ordinary.\nWALTER: It's mixed with something else. Possibly spinal fluid.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So where are the men who tied them up?\nBROYLES: Neither of them had I.D. Techs are taking prints.\nWALTER: Seem to be in some type of vegetative trance before they expired.\nPETER: So you've seen something like this before?\nWALTER: No. Nostradamus is said to have died standing up, but I highly doubt that someone who predicted his own death wouldn't have laid down.\nBROYLES: But you're saying whatever did this didn't kill them right away.\nWALTER: It's a hypothesis, but we are yet to find our Rosebud, the elusive clue that will unlock the mystery.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So has anyone located what they were after?\nBROYLES: We don't even know what they were after.\nPETER: Beware of buried treasure, huh?\nBROYLES: We're thinking there was a third thief who took whatever they dug up.\nWALTER: Unless, of course, this buried treasure had legs of its own. Wouldn't that be delightful?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Any leads on the third man?\nBROYLES: No, not yet.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I was just in Milton. We got a problem. Your little plan wasn't so foolproof. The device was supposed to be there, right? Well, it wasn't. One of your men must have taken it. Two of your men died like you planned, but the other one survived and took the device.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I only hired two men. (Bolivia shows him crime-scene photographs of the two diggers) That's them, yeah. If there were three, all three should be dead. No one can withstand that thing.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, someone did, and we need to find him.\n(Joe stands in Blake's apartment, staring at the box)\n(Blake's brain makes a squishy-popping sound as Walter pulls it from the corpse)\nASTRID: (working nearby) That sound creeps me out.\nWALTER: Really? I always found it oddly comforting. (looking at the thin cross-sectioning she has done for the microscope) Oh, that's very good, Dear. Have you ever worked behind a deli counter?\nASTRID: (removes her gloves as she studies him) Walter, your tie. I, uh...\nWALTER: Oh.\nASTRID: I think you have a little bit of brain on it. Here, let me, uh...\nWALTER: (takes his tie and tastes the dark blotch on it) It's raspberry jam.\nPETER: (walks into the lab from the hallway) Walter, it's time to go.\nASTRID: (to Peter) Can you give us just a minute?\nWALTER: (to Astrid) Maybe I'm overdressed. Maybe I should change anyway.\nASTRID: Walter, you look fine. (starts cleaning the necktie)\nWALTER: (concerned) No, I don't think I can do this.\nASTRID: Walter, it's gonna be okay. You look lovely. (making him smile)\nWALTER: (walking the corridor to Nina's office with Peter) This place makes me feel so insignificant. I read that they invented a wheelchair that can be steered by brainwaves alone. Some sort of micro-electro technology. (notices an odd research project through an open lab door)\nNINA: (meeting the Bishop's in the corridor) Walter. Peter. We are set up in my office.\nWALTER: Nina, I know that this has been a great loss to you as well. (embraces her in an awkward hug for both)\nWILL EXECUTOR: (sitting at a table, reading Bell's final testament. Nina and Walter each receive a letter. Nina receives a brass ship's bell) \"My great friend Isaac once said, life is joy, death is peace. It's transition that's difficult. I was not a man of many friends, but if I'd had hundreds, I would still cherish the two of you most. Nina, I was your right hand, and you were mine. For the many hours we spent exploring the impossible, a small thank you. And for the precious few we had alone in Tuscany, a memento of me.\" (Nina unveils her memento) \"Walter, we gather knowledge faster than we gather wisdom. By now I trust you have ample reserves of both. I hope you've forgiven me.\" (Walter opens and reads the letter he received) Thus concludes the last will and testament of William Bell. Thank you all for coming. (Nina and Walter stare intently across the table at one another)\nPETER: (walking the corridor after reading) So you gonna tell me?\nWALTER: What?\nPETER: About the letter.\nWALTER: No. (slightly confused) I don't think so.\nPETER: (answers ringing cell phone) Hello?\nBROYLES: (calling on cell phone from the Federal Building) Dunham's not picking-up. You two at Blake's apartment yet?\nPETER: No, I'm not with Dunham. Who's Blake?\nBROYLES: He's one of the two men we found in the basement. We got a fingerprint hit on him this morning. She didn't call you?\nPETER: No, she didn't.\n(quietly searching the messy residence alone. reaching for her pistol when she hears a noise at the door)\nPETER: (enters the home) Hey.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey. Broyles called you.\nPETER: Yeah.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sorry. I know you don't want to babysit, but I knew Walter had a big day today, and if I called, you'd come.\nPETER: (looks around at the mess) Blake's got a friend living here.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Looks that way. Although there's nothing to tell us who he is. I was just gonna go look for the landlord, see what he knows. Maybe you could do another once-over, in case I missed something? (leaves the apartment and makes a cell phone call from the alleyway. The thief with the box drives-up and stops nearby) It's Dunham. You got a pen?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (on cell phone) I do now.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: 1200 Remington Place, Cambridge. Bishop and I will be gone in thirty minutes. I need you there then. We've got to bring this guy in.\n(Joe sits in his vehicle next to the box and makes written notations on a pad of paper)\nASTRID: Walter? (approaches as he sits and examines a brain) How was the reading of the will?\nWALTER: You know, there's this South American centipede that's been known to crawl through the nasal passages and wreak this kind of havoc.\nASTRID: Do you think that a bug could have killed all five victims and disrupted the electronics in the house?\nWALTER: Probably not. (angrily tears off his latex gloves)\nASTRID: Hey. (consoling) Hey. Walter. Is everything okay?\nWALTER: (glum) No. (takes a key from Bell's letter)\nASTRID: This is from Bell? It's a key to a safety deposit box. (she reads the letter. \"DON'T BE AFRAID TO CROSS THE LINE.\")\nWALTER: It's an old argument. Belly and I spent days discussing the wisdom of crossing the line. \"Only those that risk going too far can possibly know how far they can go.\" That's what Belly used to say.\nASTRID: So you were the cautious one?\nWALTER: He was over there. He saw what I did, all that I destroyed. How can he tell me to cross the line?\nASTRID: (vehement) Walter, you saved Peter's life. I know that there were consequences, but Peter has got to understand why you made the choices you made. You've talked to him, haven't you?\nWALTER: I've been waiting for the right moment.\nASTRID: Walter, you said you were gonna do that days ago. He has got to hear your side of the story.\nWALTER: (puts on his jacket to leave, then notices something on the brain he has been studying) Endolymph fluid. There's severe damage to the inner ear. Pass me a swab, please. (swabs the ear of the corpse) I think I know what happened here.\n(later, after Peter has joined them)\nPETER: (looking for a phonograph album in the collection) Walter, I can't find The Requiem.\nWALTER: Perhaps Don Giovanni.\nASTRID: So you think that music killed these people?\nWALTER: Not music per se. (prepares to don a cranial cap with neural sensors) Could you help me with this please, my dear?\nPETER: What about this? (holds out a new album from the collection) Would that work?\nWALTER: (to Peter) Figaro. Perfect. (to Astrid) We've known for some time that different sounds affect the brain in different ways. (places the phonograph needle on the record album, then begins to sing his own lyrics over the classical Italian ones) Look at my brain waves on the monitoro.\nASTRID: (notices the brain wave patterns from Walter's cranial sensors are decreasing in intensity) They're smoothing out.\nPETER: Harmonic music reduces neural activity.\nWALTER: Which is why we think more clearly when we listen to it. As opposed to this. (changes tunes to a fast-paced contemporary techno-anthem) Dissonance. Look--look at my neurons. Look at my neurons. (the monitor displays increased and intensified brain wave patterns)\nPETER: We get it, Walter. Can I turn this off now?\nWALTER: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. (the room returns to silence) You see, the point is this, that with this type of auditory phenomenon, taken to its ultrasonic extreme, can be fatal, and the way it affects the brain, it could well have induced some type of vegetative trance before death.\nPETER: Which would also explain the trauma to the inner ear.\nASTRID: So we're looking for some kind of deadly music box?\nPETER: No, it's ultrasonic, so you wouldn't be able to hear it. The frequency's too high.\nWALTER: Silent but deadly. (lowers his voice) Speaking of which... might like to take a step away.\nPETER: (slightly disgusted) Delightful, Walter. Any ideas why it didn't affect the third man? Maybe headphones of some sort?\nWALTER: They would need to be very sophisticated.\nPETER: I'm gonna call Broyles. (walks from the lab toward his office) Have him monitor the city for any abnormal ultrasonic activity.\nASTRID: Walter. (softly urging him to follow his son) Go talk to him.\nOLIVIA: (on videotape) All the victims were patients of Doctor Laxmeesh Nayak. He ran an outpatient clinic in Seattle. Nayak was ostensibly treating these patients as part of a clinical trial for sleep disorders.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (studying the videotape, then to herself) You got a photographic memory. How am I gonna do that? (answers Joe's knock on the door and aims her pistol at the man) You don't move unless I tell you to. Got it? Okay. Step inside. (he does) Put the box down. On the bench. Slowly. (he complies again)\nJOE: Please. Don't hurt me, Missus Dunham.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You're deaf. (after listening to his speech patterns) That's why you didn't die.\nPETER: (finshes a call on his cell phone) I'll call Olivia. Thanks.\nWALTER: (enters the inner office) Peter, may I have a moment?\nPETER: Sure. What's up?\nWALTER: I, uh... today when I said goodbye to Belly, it was hard. Very hard.\nPETER: Sure, it was. Um, I'm sorry if I wasn't... (more considerate)\nWALTER: No, not that. What I'm trying to say is that it was nothing, nothing compared to saying good-bye to my son.\nPETER: (tries to leave the room) Walter, I've got to call Olivia.\nWALTER: (steps in his way) Peter, you need to hear this. (very somber) When Peter... my Peter... died... I lost all hope. The only thing that kept me alive was Elizabeth, and my window into your world. I always told Belly that we couldn't cross over, that it was far too dangerous. When I saw that you were dying too, and that I was the only one who could save you...\nPETER: ...you kidnapped me, Walter. You took me from my family. From my world.\nWALTER: I didn't plan to. That was not my intention. (pauses) I love you, Peter. And if I had to make the choice all over again, I'm not sure that I'd be strong enough to act differently, but, now I understand that it was wrong, that I should never have crossed the line, that it was terribly wrong.\nPETER: (quietly upset) I can't talk about this yet, Walter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: He saw my badge outside of Blake's apartment. He thought he was bringing the box back to the authorities.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I'll come back after I'm done to help you with him. It's too bad he's not blind. If you need me to take care of him...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, you can just do your job. Make sure you don't screw it up this time.\n(Newton leaves with the box and Bolivia fastens a silencer to her pistol. she walks up behind Joe and fires once into the back of his head)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm sorry.\n(as she drags the body, there is a knock at the door)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (through the peephole) Peter.\nPETER: (from the hallway) Hey. Did I come at a bad time?\nPETER: (loudly from the hallway) Hey, you want me to come back later?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (blatantly lying) No, not at all. I, uh, I just got out of the shower, so can you just give me a minute? (drags Joe into the bathroom)\nPETER: (apologetic) I'm sorry. I should have called before I came over.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (after wetting her hair, pretending to start drying it and partially disrobing, she opens the door to her apartment) Hey.\nPETER: Hey. Mind if I come in?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sure.\nPETER: So... Walter apologized to me. (sits on her sofa) I know it wouldn't take much. A few words, a hug, a couple hands of Uno. Anything would make the man feel better at this point, but... I just can't bring myself to do it. Sometimes I can't even look the guy in the eye.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (sits across from him) Well, you two have been through a lot. You can't expect just to go back to the way it was before overnight. We all know this has been hard on you, Peter.\nPETER: No, you have no idea. I saw what Walter did. I saw the quarantine zones. (leans closer) I saw all the damage that he caused. He destroyed their world. My world.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, he couldn't have known how bad it was gonna be.\nPETER: Yeah. I mean, it's not like they gave him a picture of himself with fireballs coming out of his eyes while he was strapped into a doomsday machine.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You didn't come here to talk about Walter, did you?\nPETER: I can't close my eyes without seeing that picture. And whatever is in those blueprints is my connection to that machine. What if they're right? What if that machine does exactly what Broyles and Walter think it does? Is that my destiny, my fate? Am I supposed to destroy worlds too? Because, I'll be honest with you, I don't really want to turn out like Walter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (notices over Peter's shoulder that blood from Joe is seeping under the door to the bathroom) Peter, the truth is I'm scared too. The last few weeks have been hard on all of us. (moves close to Peter on the sofa) You know, of course there's always the temporary fix.\nPETER: The temporary fix?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Distraction. (leans over Peter and kisses him on the lips)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (after entering the station carrying the box under his arm, he sits and addresses a tiny vagrant resting on a bench) Hello.\nHOMELESS MAN: Hi. (studies the container resting between them) What's this?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: It's, uh... It's a box.\nHOMELESS MAN: Well, what's in it?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: As with most things in life, the reality would pale in comparison with one's imagination. And, uh, isn't it better to wonder? (returns to reading his paper. after a few moments) I say, uh, would you mind keeping an eye on the box while I go to the restroom?\nHOMELESS MAN: Is there, you know, remuneration?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Of course. There you go. (hands over a bill) I won't be a minute.\nHOMELESS MAN: Okay. (Newton strolls away and upstairs)\n(Bolivia and Peter continue their romantic interlude on the sofa. while they kiss, blood continues to trickle from beneath the bathroom door and remains unnoticed by Peter. both of their cell phones ring at the same time)\nPETER: (reads his caller ID) Astrid.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (reads her caller ID) Broyles.\nPETER: (sarcastically to Bolivia) Well, that can't be a good sign.\nWALTER: (as the team parks their vehicles at the surface entrance) Kent Street. I frequented a massage parlor just around the corner. I used to get off right here.\nPETER: I sure hope you're talking about the station, Walter.\nBROYLES: (as his team approaches him and the entrance-way down to the loading platform) We got five more victims, maybe more unaccounted for. All mobile, but unresponsive. They're in some kind of trance. Lieutenant, I want every subway station in Boston evacuated. Security cameras picked up a small man walking into the tunnel carrying a metallic box.\nWALTER: (walking around) These people seem to be suffering from the same symptoms as the victims at Milton.\nBROYLES: Yes, we're thinking the box might be what the thieves dug up there.\nPETER: What about the trains?\nBROYLES: System runs on a computer. We've logged in and stopped all trains going into the tunnel.\nPOLICE CAPTAIN: (approaching with news) Bomb squad's ready to deploy a man in the tunnel.\nPETER: Bomb squad? (loudly) This thing's not a bomb. You send your men in there, they're gonna get killed.\nBROYLES: That tunnel leads straight to another station. If this box is mobile, we have to stop it. You have a better idea?\nPETER: Yeah, I'll go.\nWALTER: Peter, you can't. It's too dangerous.\nPETER: The box is our responsibility, Walter. And if I can get in front of it, maybe I can disarm it.\nWALTER: No, no, no. (almost stammering) I haven't had time to devise something to protect you from the sound emissions.\nPETER: I'm sure your boys have some sort of ear protection, right?\nWALTER: The frequencies are ultrasonic. Simple noise cancellation won't work. (emphatic) I'd have to disable all impulses along the cochlear nerve.\nPOLICE CAPTAIN: My men are standing by, Agents.\nBROYLES: Peter, I have to make a call here.\nPETER: What is it, Walter?\nWALTER: The science is tenuous to say the least.\nPETER: Walter, if you have a way to put me in front of that box, you got to tell me right now. Walter, talk to me.\nWALTER: (worried) Agent Dunham, we're going to need your gun.\nRADIO CHATTER: Mic test. One, two.\nPETER: (after putting on a vest) So how long have I got?\nWALTER: I don't know. If you can hear us talking, it's too late.\nPETER: Well, ballpark it for me, Walter.\nWALTER: Maximum, three minutes.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You ready?\nPETER: (nods) Do it.\n(Bolivia points her pistol next to Peter's left ear and fires. He turns and she fires again next to his other ear, effectively making him deaf for a brief time. he nods at the team, confirms that his radio is on and leaves the platform to enter the tunnel. inside, he turns on his flashlight and visually searches ahead. he finds the device, and the thief, and calls on the radio that he has found it)\nPETER: I see it. (seconds later, the head of the vagrant explodes violently) Oh, my god. (he grabs the device and moves away from the fresh carnage. he studies the case and the contents briefly then announces on the radio) I know what this is. It's a piece of the weapon. I recognize it from Walternate's blueprints.\nBROYLES: (on the platform to Walter and Bolivia) The weapon from the other side? How's that possible?\nPETER: (over the radio to the team as they wait on the loading platform) It looks like the box was soundproof. But it's broken. I can't close it. I'm gonna try to disarm it. (begins to attach connectors, sensors and clamps to various wires on the interior of the device. cuts one wire with no decrease in output. )\nWALTER: (to the team after he looks at his watch) He hasn't spoken for seventy-one seconds. Something is wrong. His hearing could come back at any time. We need to send someone in.\nBROYLES: (emphatically to Walter) I can't send another man in there.\nWALTER: (negotiating. begging) He could be hurt. He could be dy...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (holds up hand for silence) Hey, guys. Do you hear that? (mechanical vehicle sounds heard from the tunnel)\nBROYLES: (yelling into his handheld radio) I thought all the trains were stopped.\nWALTER: (studying the space around him) The device affected the subway's communication system.\nBROYLES: (as Bolivia jumps from the platform and races towards Peter) Dunham, wait! You can't go in there!\n(Peter fails to disarm the ultrasonic weapon a third and fourth time. the energy output remains at full power until he moves a connector and the output drops to zero. relieved, he wipes his brow - then senses that something is not right, though he can't hear what it is. he touches the rail near him, then turns to see a train bearing down on him. just a few feet away from being struck, Peter is grabbed by the running Bolivia and safely tackled into a shallow alcove. the train passes)\nWALTER: (as the body bag is zipped closed on the diminuitive vagrant, his head mostly missing) For a catastrophic explosion like that, I imagine he had some sort of surgical implant. Dental ceramic crowns. If they were to vibrate at just the right resonant frequency... I always hated dentists.\nBROYLES: (looks at the ultrasonic device) And you're sure this is part of the weapon?\nPETER: Yeah, looks just like the parts I saw on the other side. And we know that Walternate has agents over here. Maybe they're looking for the missing pieces, the ones he couldn't find over there.\nBROYLES: (speaking softly, privately, after Peter approaches) Why would there be pieces on our side?\nPETER: (softly) You got a better explanation? We're talking about two universes here. Two of each one of us. At this point, would anything really surprise you?\nWALTER: (answering the question that wasn't directed at him) Bacon-flavored pudding. That would surprise me.\nPETER: (steps over to the device) I'd like to take this back to the lab. We got the blueprints. Maybe I can figure it out.\nBROYLES: Okay. (as Peter signs the reciept for the container and its' contents)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (runs into Peter as he prepares to leave the subway platform with the container) I guess you've got other plans for tonight.\nPETER: Yeah. Do you mind? (apologetic)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (earnest) Of course not.\nBROYLES: (privately with Walter) Today was a bad day. But it could have been a lot worse. Your quick thinking saved a lot of lives, Doctor Bishop. Good work. (pats the Doctor on the arm as he steps away to talk to a uniformed policeman)\n(alone, Walter removes from his pocket, the key to Bell's safety deposit box and looks at it tentatively)\n(Walter finds his way to a brightly lit bank and then to an interior safe deposit vault. the banker in the vault removes a container from a wall of locked containers and places it on a table for Walter. Walter opens the container after the banker leaves and looks slightly baffled at what is inside. in the lab, Peter prepares to take notes and begins to inspect the ultrasonic device)\n(Walter roams the interior of a pleasant apartment complex looking at door numbers. he stops in front of 204, checks his note, then knocks)\nASTRID: (surprised at her visitor) Walter. Hi.\nWALTER: I know what Belly left me.\nASTRID: Oh?\nWALTER: (removes an envelope from beneath his overcoat) He left me Massive Dynamic. (shows her a stack of corporate shares) I'm the sole shareholder.\n(in the lab, Peter continues his inspection and begins comparing the ultrasonic component he has to the blueprint plans)\n(Bolivia enters the communication room, closes the door, sits and rolls a fresh piece of paper into the Selectric 251 and types)"

Ugh!\nFEMALE WITNESS: (as a bike messenger goes careening into a fruit stand) Oh, my gosh!\nGROCER: (to the bicyclist that toppled over his fruit) You alright? You alright?\nGATHERED CROWD: (overlapping shouting on the busy street - a distraction to local drivers)\nREFOCUSED CROWD: (gasps and screams - as the woman targeted by Milo is struck and killed by a large passenger bus with a distracted driver)\nAGENT FRANCIS: Welcome back, Agent Dunham. You do remember me, right?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. You're that tightwad that owes me seventy dollars.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Damn it! I was -- I was hoping you'd forget about that. It's good to see you.\nOLIVIA: You too.\nAGENT FRANCIS: No worse for the wear -- you look like you got some rest.\nOLIVIA: A continuous I.V. drip and government-issue antipsychotics, It's like instant R & R.\nAGENT FRANCIS: It sounds like fun. Maybe I should, uh, dive off the deep end.\nOLIVIA: Hey, you think anyone would notice a difference?\nAGENT FRANCIS: You know what I realized this minute? That I didn't miss you at all, not even an itty, little bit.\nOLIVIA: Come on, you were lost without me. Admit it.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah, yeah.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: How does she seem?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: She seems like Olivia Dunham.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: For all intents and purposes, she is Agent Dunham. She's internalized her traits, her memories, her knowledge. When tested, she consistently responds as our Agent Dunham would under similar circumstances.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: And what about our Agent Dunham? Has she made contact?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: She is on the other side... focused on the task at hand.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Permission to speak, Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Go ahead.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Putting an impostor on my team is too big a risk. Now, you can run all the tests you want, but you don't know how this Olivia will respond in the field.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: We have no other choice. She needs to be completely immersed in Agent Dunham's life. Over time, she will reach a plateau, and her new identity will become fixed.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: How much time? Because I'm not willing to lose one of my legitimate agents.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You don't know what we have to gain.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Which is what, exactly?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Sit down. She can move between worlds. We have discovered some ways to cross over. But each comes with their own dangerous consequences - but she... she can cross without harm. The Science Division is working-up a series of experiments. We need her to submit willingly, which she'll only do if she believes that she belongs here. Phillip... if we can learn what she already knows...\nCOLONEL BROYLES: ...we can begin to defend ourselves. And what if her new identity doesn't hold?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Then she'll no longer be necessary. Keep me apprised.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Yes, sir.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yesterday a Liberty Metro bus ran a red light, killing a person. This morning same thing happened again. Two mornings in a row, two buses kill two people. Now, Lookers ran the probabilities, and it's a statistical anomaly.\nOLIVIA: What happened at yesterday's crash?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Police considered it a routine accident, so we have no more information. You mind taking over?\nOLIVIA: Sure. Okay... the first victim's name is Cole Arnett, forty-three years old. He was on his way to his job. He is a hospital case worker. Must've been his unlucky day.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright, we're coming in. Oxygen, people.\nAGENT: Air quality normal, no oxygen needed.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay, listen up. Agent Lee will be meeting us on the site. He'll be calling the shots. (To police officer) Agent Francis.\nMELISSA: Watch the time Agent Lee. I need you back in that chamber in eight hours, or your burns will regress. You can kiss all that healing good-bye.\nLINCOLN LEE: Easy come, easy go.\nMELISSA: Oh, you think you're amusing.\nLINCOLN LEE: I am amusing! God, I miss this.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I bet. Did, uh, Broyles download you yet?\nLINCOLN LEE: Talked to him on the way over. I need a victim I.D.\nAGENT FRANCIS: See what I can do.\nLINCOLN LEE: Where's my...?\nOLIVIA: ...Field kit? Here. You look better.\nLINCOLN LEE: You look sane. You doing alright?\nOLIVIA: So far. I mean, it's my first day back, so... listen, when I pulled that gun on you, I didn't know what I was doing. Something had happened...\nLINCOLN LEE: ...but nothing happened. You and I we're good.\nOLIVIA: Yeah?\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah.\nMALE EMT: Died on impact. No attempts to revive her were made.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Obviously. Still have any fingerprints?\nMALE EMT: Right hand's probably your best bet.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Real name's Jillian Foster, thirty-two. Lives right here in Hoboken.\nMALE EMT: Anything else?\nAGENT FRANCIS: She liked daisies.\nBUS DRIVER: I never hit a person before, never. I mean, once, I hit a pigeon. I felt horrible for weeks.\nLINCOLN LEE: No sign of environmental degradation. Molecular cohesion is intact.\nAGENT: So why is this a Fringe case?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, yeah. We're done. Thanks. What, you got something?\nLINCOLN LEE: When's the last time you saw one of these?\nOLIVIA: God, a pen? I don't know. Preschool maybe.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I didn't know they still made these.\nLINCOLN LEE: It's obviously new. No dents, no scratches.\nOLIVIA: Where'd you find it?\nLINCOLN LEE: Right there, by the mailbox.\nOLIVIA: Oh, that's where the bike messenger said he swerved, so he wouldn't hit some old guy that was bending down.\nLINCOLN LEE: Huh.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Uh, you want to share, buddy? Or are we supposed to stand here and watch you think?\nLINCOLN LEE: Alright... it's pretty rare finding one of these just lying around.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe the old guy bent down to pick it up, and that's what caused the bike messenger to swerve.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Causing him to hit the stand.\nLINCOLN LEE: Like the pen started some kind of... chain reaction.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Did you find something?\nLINCOLN LEE: What is it?\nOLIVIA: Sorry, I thought I recognized someone.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright, so... Fringe Event... or not?\nLINCOLN LEE: Not sure yet. But something weird definitely happened here.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Hello?\nFRANK STANTON: Hey, babe.\nOLIVIA: You didn't have to do that.\nFRANK STANTON: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nFRANK STANTON: So how was it?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, it was... it was pretty good.\nFRANK STANTON: Yeah?\nOLIVIA: What's happening in North Texas? I heard it's a pretty bad outbreak.\nFRANK STANTON: Twenty-two smallpox cases so far.\nOLIVIA: Has Atlanta called?\nFRANK STANTON: No, no one's assigned me yet.\nOLIVIA: Oh.\nFRANK STANTON: Wait, why are we talking about this?\nOLIVIA: Because you're a virologist, and smallpox is one of your areas of expertise. You may as well start packing.\nFRANK STANTON: No, I mean, why are we talking about me? I want to talk about you. How was it being back at work? What's wrong? Did something happen?\nOLIVIA: Well, at first, it was normal. And then we're out in the field, and -- and... I saw a face.\nFRANK STANTON: A face?\nOLIVIA: Mm.\nFRANK STANTON: Was it someone you know?\nOLIVIA: Do you remember the Secretary's son -- the one who was kidnapped when he was a boy?\nFRANK STANTON: Mm-hmm.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, him. But it wasn't really him. It was -- it was like I was hallucinating or something.\nFRANK STANTON: Did you tell Broyles?\nOLIVIA: No.\nFRANK STANTON: Maybe you shouldn't be on field duty.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I want to be there.\nFRANK STANTON: I know, but you have to tell someone -- a doctor, at least.\nOLIVIA: I need my life back, Frank.\nFRANK STANTON: And I love your gung-ho attitude, but, Honey, you just got over a breakdown. If you need help, that's fine.\nOLIVIA: Frank, it was my first day back. I was nervous. I don't think that it's that surprising that there's a trace...\nFRANK STANTON: I can take myself off call. Maybe it's not a good time to travel.\nOLIVIA: That's not what I want. Are those avocados? Where did you get them? How much?\nFRANK STANTON: Don't worry about that. Liv, what if it happens again?\nOLIVIA: It won't.\nFRANK STANTON: But if it does, you'll tell Broyles, right? Because... I love you.\nOLIVIA: I'll tell him.\nFRANK STANTON: Thank you.\nOLIVIA: Can we eat?\nFRANK STANTON: Yes, we can eat.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nFRANK STANTON: Okay.\nLINCOLN LEE: Alright, help me out here. So the first bus driver was distracted by tree trimmers when he ran the red light. The second bus driver was looking at a fight over oranges. Isn't distraction the root of every accident?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Listen, I'm not finding any connections in these victims' bios either. The first guy, Arnett, worked at a hospital for the past fifteen years. The second victim, Miz Foster, landed her position at Gregston Electric a little over a year ago.\nLINCOLN LEE: Maybe they knew someone in common?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Or maybe, despite what Farnsworth said, it's just... two freak accidents.\nLINCOLN LEE: You know, Liv thinks I'm right... about there being chain reactions that led up to the crashes.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay. Well, now that you two have, uh, rediscovered your Vulcan Mind Meld... do you think she's doing okay?\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah. Why, you don't think so?\nAGENT FRANCIS: I don't know. I just -- I just feel a little uncomfortable.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's not a shocker. You let a Doppelganger coldcock you with a bottle because you didn't pick up on the fact that she wasn't your partner.\nAGENT FRANCIS: And you would have?\nLINCOLN LEE: I just know Liv a little better, that's all.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Right. 'cause you -- you kissed her one time.\nLINCOLN LEE: How was I supposed to know she had a boyfriend?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay.\nLINCOLN LEE: Whatever. The point is, I would've known.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah, keep telling yourself that, okay? When she was having her breakdown, she kept on and on about how they were trying to make her believe she was somebody else, that this wasn't her life. This is gonna sound nuts. What if she's telling the truth? What if it's not the real her?\nLINCOLN LEE: That is nuts.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You're right. Alright. For the record, you cannot tell those two apart.\nLINCOLN LEE: Look at this-- over there on the ground, the lower corner.\nAGENT FRANCIS: That's another ballpoint pen.\nLINCOLN LEE: Get Liv, tell her we got something. Someone is causing these accidents on purpose.\nAGENT FRANCIS: How is that even possible? I mean, what would be the odds?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: ... zero-point-zero-zero-zero - impossible.\nLINCOLN LEE: Astrid, we see impossible every day.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: You see improbable. You're asking me if it is possible for a person to use a ballpoint pen to set off a chain of events that culminates in someone getting killed by a bus twice?\nLINCOLN LEE: Exactly.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: There's no way.\nOLIVIA: But given how few ballpoint pens are out there, finding one at both crime scenes-- I mean, that's an anomaly. You said that yourself.\nLINCOLN LEE: What if someone calculated the variables?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Thirty-seven people in the intersection, twenty-two cars, four trucks, two buses, wind speeds of five to ten miles an hour, and that is just to start. In total, we are talking about a hundred and twenty variables in a dynamic system of differential equations. I can't solve that kind of a problem, much less manipulate the outcome to my advantage.\nLINCOLN LEE: So there's not even the slightest chance we're dealing with a murderer?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Dude, seriously? What part of zero-point-zero-zero-zero don't you get?\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: It happened again.\nLINCOLN LEE: What did?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Bus accident, East 85th and York.\nOLIVIA: Have you called the ambulance?\nPOLICE OFFICER: It's on the way.\nOLIVIA: Sir, we're gonna get you to the hospital.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Where were you sitting on the bus?\nFEMALE PASSENGER: Right in the front, first seat.\nLINCOLN LEE: Did you happen to notice a pen?\nTEEN MALE: What?\nLINCOLN LEE: A-a pen, a-a ballpoint pen. You use it to... to write with.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Looks like there was some sort of commotion. Dog ran into the street, distracted a bus driver. There is no way this is another coincidence.\nOLIVIA: Except this time it didn't work. He's gonna make it. Uh, ma'am, you need to stay still. It's not over. He's still here! Stop! Don't move! Take your hands out of your pockets. Put your hands on your head. Whoa!\nLINCOLN LEE: Give Astrid his physical description. Have her run it through the database.\nOLIVIA: I did. She's already working on it. Okay, you've got to get back in that pod.\nLINCOLN LEE: It's just the two-minute warning.\nMELISSA: Agent Lee, what part of \"be back in eight hours\" didn't you understand?\nOLIVIA: You know, I - I still can't believe that he knew the bike would cause the truck to slow down and swerve under the footbridge. I mean, he didn't even look. How did he know precisely when to jump?\nLINCOLN LEE: You should stop focusing on how and focus on why. Why is he targeting these people?\nOLIVIA: Alright, I'm working on it.\nLINCOLN LEE: The victims must have something in common. There's got to be a connection we're not seeing.\nMELISSA: Oh gawd.\nOLIVIA: Okay Lincoln, you got to get in there.\nLINCOLN LEE: Cross-check their medical files, criminal records, job histories, tax histories...\nOLIVIA: Shut up, okay? I got it.\nLINCOLN LEE: Someone's gotten bossy.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Where have you been? They've been calling all day.\nMILO STANFIELD: What did you tell them?\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Nothing. You have to call them back.\nMILO STANFIELD: Each liquefied thing provides an instance of the proper gift being liquid. Liquid and mass is equal. Passing through liquid and mass is the same.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: If you don't call them, I will.\nMILO STANFIELD: But you won't. You see, your only action will be inaction. That's your pattern.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: What?\nMILO STANFIELD: Ninety-seven percent of your actions prioritize relational bonds over other variables. Eight out of nine times, you avoid making decisions that could result in a negative outcome.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: I am not some collection of data you need to make sense of.\nSIMULTANEOUSLY: I'm your sister.\nMILO STANFIELD: I'm worried about you. Can't you see that?\nMADELINE STANFIELD: All I want is for you to...\nMILO STANFIELD: ...is for you to be safe. That's all I've ever wanted for you. Go again.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Stop finishing my sentences...\nSIMULTANEOUSLY: ...and let me help you.\nMILO STANFIELD: Trust me, Milo, I've always been there for you. I've always taken care of you. That was fun. (holds out small figurine of horse) Don't. I... Don't. Don't.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: You didn't expect that, did you? Because you've forgotten what it's like to feel emotions.\nMILO STANFIELD: No, no.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: You've forgotten us. Mom gave you this as a reminder...\nMILO STANFIELD: No.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: That you didn't have to do more than you were able to, that we loved you.\nMILO STANFIELD: That's irrelevant now.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Milo, please! I don't recognize you anymore. I made a mistake when I signed you up. I didn't mean this. You have to follow the rules. You have to do what they say. You're overreaching. Remember this. (horse figurine)\nAGENT FRANCIS: Li--listen... what time is your mommy gonna be home? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to hear you play your flute, kid. I'm gonna call you back.\nOLIVIA: You just hung up on a child.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You talk to the next witness. I hope it's a tuba player, okay?\nOLIVIA: Fine. Uh, this is Agent Dunham, can you connect me to the next witness, please? Excuse me? Hey, Charlie...\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah?\nOLIVIA: Since when do we need a code?\nAGENT FRANCIS: They upgraded the system last month. You don't remember?\nOLIVIA: Sorry. I guess I'm still getting over the head trauma.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Uh-huh. Hey, Liv.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You remember that time when we were at Coney Island? We were riding the Hellhole together, right? You got sick, and you threw up on the guy next to you.\nOLIVIA: Yeah... except you threw up all over the person next to you - so you can stop trying to rewrite history. What -- what made you think of that?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Witness is from Coney.\nOLIVIA: Oh. Hey, wait a sec... Jillian Foster was a consultant for Gregston Electric.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I don't see the connection.\nOLIVIA: The first victim worked at Bryant Hospital, right?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah, Cole Arnett. They mainly deal with neurological disorders, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, PTSD -- top-flight medical research.\nOLIVIA: Okay, it says here that Gregston Electric owns a subsidiary company called the Ivon Medical Group. The Ivon Medical Group is also listed as one of Bryant Hospital's outside vendors.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You're driving.\nAGENT FRANCIS: As hospitals go, not bad.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, unless it's run by an evil genius who's creating accidents to kill people.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Good morning.\nRECEPTIONIST: Welcome to Bryant. What can I do for you?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Agent Francis, Agent Dunham. We're here to see your Chief Medical Director.\nRECEPTIONIST: Hold on, I'll let him know. Hi, Violet. Could you let Doctor Levin know Fringe Agents are here? It'll just be a minute. Are we being quarantined?\nAGENT FRANCIS: No. Scout's honor.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Right there on the table. We're definitely in the right place.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: So sorry for the delay. I'm Doctor Levin.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Agent Francis.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Agent Dunham. Hi.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: Please, my office is right this way.\nOLIVIA: Doctor, we just noticed that a lot of your patients are using ballpoint pens.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: Well, many of our residents have trouble interfacing digitally due to their mental deficiencies. Pen and paper is just a -- well, an easier way to communicate.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Did you know Mister Arnett well?\nDOCTOR LEVIN: We didn't socialize outside of work, but, uh, well, we were all devastated when we heard.\nOLIVIA: What about this woman?\nDOCTOR LEVIN: Yes, Jillian Foster. She, uh, worked with the Ivon Medical Group. They were, uh, conducting a drug trial here. You're kidding me. Jeffrey Mayer?\nAGENT FRANCIS: You know him?\nDOCTOR LEVIN: Yes. But I, uh -- I don't understand. He was killed too?\nOLIVIA: Doctor, we're gonna have to question all your science and medical personnel on staff.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: You're not looking for a doctor. You're looking for a patient. We started this study a year ago. We were working on creating \"nootropics.\"\nOLIVIA: Like smart drugs.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: That's right. All of our test subjects started with an I.Q. of less than sixty-five. Our aim was to increase their intelligence so they could function independently day to day.\nAGENT FRANCIS: That's a worthy goal.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: We thought so too.\nOLIVIA: Oh, st -- ca-- can you go back? Stop. That's him.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: Milo Stanfield.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You don't sound surprised.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: I'm not. This was Milo five months ago -- measured I.Q. of fifty-six, severe cognitive deficiency.\nOLIVIA: He's reciting the digits of Pi...\nDOCTOR LEVIN: ... to one thousand decimal places, while solving differential equations in his head.\nAGENT FRANCIS: That is unbelievable.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: That was after one treatment. We gave him five. Every time we administered the protocol, his intelligence increased exponentially. The final phase of the project allows subjects to be released under the supervision of a guardian's care.\nOLIVIA: And after that?\nDOCTOR LEVIN: After that, we return the subjects to their original state. A necessary part of human drug trials. We had to determine whether there are any permanent adverse side effects.\nOLIVIA: So Milo didn't want to be regressed, which is why he went after Cole Arnett.\nDOCTOR LEVIN: We thought it was an accident. I drove to Ivon and informed Jillian myself. She was concerned that the delay in regressing Milo might compromise the results. She offered to handle it herself.\nAGENT FRANCIS: So Milo killed her too. So what about the third victim? Jeffrey Mayer?\nDOCTOR LEVIN: A recovery specialist, who we contract with if somebody goes missing. The thing is... I only put the order in yesterday. Mister Mayer had not yet been assigned the task.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so who's Milo's guardian?\nDOCTOR LEVIN: Uh, his sister. She lives out on Long Island -- Oyster Bay, I believe.\nOLIVIA: You really think he'd go back there? He's got to know that's the first place people are gonna look.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I've been to Oyster Bay. I never saw an oyster.\nOLIVIA: I can't wait to tell Lincoln he was right, that this guy is actually able to start a chain reaction to commit murder.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I'm not watching the happy dance.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Can I help you?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Fringe Division. We need to ask you a few questions.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Uh, about?\nOLIVIA: About your brother, Milo.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Three people?\nOLIVIA: That we know of, yeah.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: No, there must be some mistake. Milo wouldn't kill innocent people.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I suppose he didn't think they were that innocent. You know, after all, they were trying to cut off the medication that was making him smart. Right?\nOLIVIA: Do you have any idea where he is now?\nMADELINE STANFIELD: He doesn't confide in me anymore.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You mind if I take a look at his room?\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Go ahead -- last door on the left.\nOLIVIA: Is that you?\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Mm-hmm.\nOLIVIA: \"Milo and Madeline\" -- sounds like a kids' book.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: You're not the first person to say that.\nOLIVIA: Ah, you seem close.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: We were. He was a lot older, but... we liked the same cartoons, played the same games.\nOLIVIA: I had the opposite. My sister and I were close in age, but... we fought over everything.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Are you close now?\nOLIVIA: Uh, she passed a few years ago.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: Oh, I'm sorry. That must've been... really difficult.\nOLIVIA: It was.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: When I was little, I used to always be scared that something would happen to Milo. He'd forget to check for cars, just run right into traffic. I worried that he'd never be happy. He'd never feel like... like he belonged.\nOLIVIA: Must've been hard watching him struggle.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: It was harder for him. That's why I agreed to the drug study.\nOLIVIA: He isn't that helpless person anymore. He's dangerous, and I think you know that. So if there is anything that you can think of... we just don't want to see anyone else get hurt, including your brother.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: It's a... it's a good-bye note. But it says where I can reach him.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Patricia Hotel, Lakewood Avenue.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I'm gonna call backup, get them to meet us there.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hold on a second. What if that's what Milo wants? You know, that's his M.O., always ten steps ahead.\nOLIVIA: So what, you think he knew that his sister was gonna tell us?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Listen, he knows we're onto him. He knows his sister. What if he's trying to set us up?\nOLIVIA: Well, we can't just stand here.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I can't answer that.\nOLIVIA: Why not?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Because there is no answer. It's a mathematical problem without a solution.\nOLIVIA: Well, which scenario is more likely? We go to the Patricia Hotel, or we don't?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Suppose he predicts you'll go there. But then you'll predict he'll predict that, so you don't go.\nAGENT FRANCIS: So we shouldn't go?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: But then he predicts that you predicted that. And he changes his plan, which means that you should go to the hotel. But then he predicts that you'll predict what he predicted too. It's an infinite spiral.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, thank you, Astrid. We'll take it from here.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Where you going?\nOLIVIA: To the Patricia Hotel.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Liv...\nOLIVIA: Look, Charlie, he could be there now. I'm not willing to lose him. Are you?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Fine. You drive.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, there he is.\nMILO STANFIELD: Oh, that wasn't supposed to happen. (Olivia falls down and gasps for air)\nAGENT FRANCIS: Freeze! (shoots Milo in the leg as he flees) (to Olivia) Here. Take it. Take it. Press the button. (to Milo) You move again... the next one won't be in your leg, buddy. (to Olivia) You're okay. Just breathe.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Since when do you break protocol? You passed by an Auburn Diamond, okay? Blinking Auburn Diamond, which you ignored. Compromised air quality.\nFEMALE EMT: Pressure's normal.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nFEMALE EMT: Yep.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You need oxygen to breathe.\nOLIVIA: Charlie, I'm sorry. I don't really even know why I did that.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Because you're a daredevil. I get it. So if you don't mind... I'd appreciate it if we don't go through this again?\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nOLIVIA: The drugs have been in his system too long, so the doctors weren't able to reverse the affects. According to the doctors, the patterns that he sees are too complex to put into words. His thoughts now can only be interpreted by a machine.\nMADELINE STANFIELD: So... so the machine is talking to him?\nOLIVIA: Madeline, your brother... he no longer thinks in terms that you or I would be able to comprehend. I'm sorry.\nMILO STANFIELD: Is equal value of six. Six is the solution. What is a solution? Derives a gradient of 'Y'. Evaluate a 'Y4' and proceed. Isolate discontinuities and recalibrate. There's a forty-two percent chance that the King will take the Queen.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You know, sometimes I envy you, Brandon. Being here, nothing to distract you.\nBRANDON: Mister Secretary, I didn't realize you were coming.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: These are my son's clothes.\nBRANDON: Yes. I thought if I used items from the other side, it would provide an associative link which would spark Olivia to...\nSECRETARY BISHOP: ...cross over to the other universe. Yes, good thinking. When will it be ready?\nBRANDON: We're very close. So far, all the test subjects I've hooked up to the chair. They're experiencing a high level of anxiety, their stress is causing my readings to fluctuate. I've been tinkering with this thing all day.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: The solution is obvious. Submerge the subject in water.\nBRANDON: Sensory-deprivation tank. Of course. The womb-like atmosphere naturally provides a state of relaxation.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Sometimes simpler is better.\nBRANDON: Do you miss it?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Miss what?\nBRANDON: Being a scientist.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I am still a scientist, Brandon. I just have a much larger laboratory. Let me know as soon as the tank's ready.\nOLIVIA: God, I don't know how you do it. I'm never done packing till the cab actually arrives.\nFRANK STANTON: Well, I'm off to deal with diseased people in North Texas, so it's not like I have to look good.\nOLIVIA: Oh, except you do.\nFRANK STANTON: Are you sure you're okay with me doing this? I can still call Fiken, beg him to cover for me.\nOLIVIA: We have had this conversation.\nFRANK STANTON: I know. I know. It's just they haven't told me yet how long I'll be gone.\nOLIVIA: So just keep me posted.\nFRANK STANTON: (phone rings) That's probably the cab. (leaves the room)\nPETER (as a vision): You know why you didn't die today, right? Because you didn't know the protocol. If you'd stopped for oxygen, you'd be dead right now. But you did something that he couldn't factor in, you kept running. You know why you did that. It's the same reason you thought you saw Walter in the hospital. It's the same reason why you think you're seeing me now. You're not from this world Olivia. You're not her.\nOLIVIA: You're not real.\nPETER (as a vision): Real is just a matter of perception. I am here. And I'm a part of you that you have to hold onto. You can't forget who you are Olivia. You can't forget where you're from. You can't forget this. (a gentle kiss)\nFRANK STANTON: What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: Nothing. You just surprised me, that's all.\nFRANK STANTON: You alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. It's just I'm gonna miss you.\nFRANK STANTON: I'm gonna miss you too. I will be home as soon as I can.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Well you call me when you land.\nFRANK STANTON: Alright. Bye."

I think they work together.\nPETER: Well, she's wearing her sexiest little black dress, so somewhere deep inside of her, she was hoping this dinner was about something else.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Not work. But she was wrong.\nPETER: Yes, she was. That, however, is truly impressive. (looks at another couple)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, he's a little short for her, I'll grant you that.\nPETER: But not when you stand him on his money.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Careful. Your con man's showing.\nPETER: (gut laughs) I think I just understand transactional needs. Each party has something the other party wants. She gets security, he gets her. We all draw our moral lines in the sand. And unless you can put yourself in another man's shoes, I don't think you can really judge their situations. (looks back at the couple) But look at the body language. They haven't slept together yet.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No?\nPETER: (heavy personal subtext) You can always tell when a relationship's about to take that next step. I had a really nice time tonight.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Me too.\nPETER: But unfortunately, if I don't get home, Walter's going to start wondering where I am. And then he'll probably start calling the emergency rooms. Shall we?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah.\nPETER: (to the wait staff as they walk to the receiving area) Thanks. Have a good night.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, could you give me a moment?\nPETER: Yeah, of course. I'll be outside.\n(Bolivia heads to the restroom and takes a long, contemplative stare into the mirror)\nLEMONADE VENDORS: Hi, Senator Van Horn. (as the Senator pulls his luxury sedan over to the side of a quiet residential street, and lowers his window)\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Hi, girls. You know, I've been looking for some lemonade all day. You know where I can find some?\nLEMONADE VENDOR #1: We're selling lemonade.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: (demonstrative and child-friendly attitude) You are? Well, perfect! Missus Van Horn has me running all over town. I am parched. Oh, that looks delicious. (takes cup) How much?\nLEMONADE VENDOR #2: One dollar.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: One dollar?\nLEMONADE VENDOR #1: We made it ourselves.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: (questions the bargain pricing) Well, I don't know. (sips) You know, this just might be the best lemonade I have ever had. I'll see you, okay?\nLEMONADE VENDORS: Bye.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Bye. (drives off after leaving a very generous tip)\nLEMONADE VENDORS: Wait! You forgot your change!\n(The politician drives away from his charmed constituents, checks to see them in his rearview mirror and is distracted as a heavy truck broadsides him in the nearby intersection)\n(as emergency medical personnel rush the badly damaged politician to treatment)\nEMT: Victim is unresponsive. Possible head injury.\nNURSE: I don't feel a pulse, Doctor. Charge D-fib?\nDOCTOR #1: Not yet.\nNURSE: But he has no pulse.\nDOCTOR #1: Then why is he still breathing?\n(later, after friends and colleagues of the politician have started to gather at the hospital)\nBROYLES: Patricia.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Oh, Phillip.\nBROYLES: I heard on the news. I got here as fast as I could. How is he?\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: I don't know. They won't tell me anything.\nBROYLES: (flashes his badge at the duty desk) I want information on James Van Horn.\n(Thomas Newton saunters through the halls and towards emergency services)\nDOCTOR: Prep for intubation and alert the O.R.\nNURSE #1: O.R. is standing by.\nDOCTOR: Get me a CBC and tox screen. What's his B-P?\nNURSE #2: I'm not getting anything. He has no pressure.\nDOCTOR: Start C-P-R. What the hell is going on with this guy?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (walks into the room) Stand aside, please.\nDOCTOR: You can't be in here. (shot by Newton)\nBROYLES: (hears multiple gunshots) Stay here. (to Patricia)\n(Newton rolls Van Horn into the hall on the gurney)\nSECURITY MAN #1: Stop right there! (challenges Newton and is shot)\nSECURITY MAN #2: Freeze! (challenges Newton and is shot)\nBROYLES: F-B-I... Drop your weapon! (Newton turns, fires, misses. Broyles fires and hits Newton. Newton grabs a female hostage for protection)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: You, come here! (to Broyles) I will kill her! Drop your weapon! Do it!\nBROYLES: (as Newton shoots the Senator in the face) No!\n(Newton continues firing, releases the hostage, enters a stairwell and jumps several floors to escape. Broyles approaches Van Horn. the politician has the mechanical eye of a shape-shifting soldier from the parallel universe)\n(walking the corridor to retrieve Walter)\nPETER: You can't seriously expect me to believe that you are okay with this.\nNINA: Well, William's last wish was that your father take over this company, my personal feelings are not at issue.\nPETER: With a basement lab in Harvard, Walter was able to open a wormhole into another dimension that essentially shredded all the laws of science. I can't wait to see what he's capable of doing with a multi-billion dollar corporation.\nNINA: Your father made some regrettable choices in the past, but his brilliance is undeniable. It was that intellect that William Bell believed in. And frankly, so do I.\nPETER: It's not his intellect I'm concerned about.\n(briefing a room full of corporate scientists on his personal philosophy and outlook)\nWALTER: So beautiful, It is absolutely breathtaking. Somewhere between pudding and foie gras. And why do I bring this up? You, with the red hair.\nSCIENTIST: It's black.\nWALTER: I see red. Answer the question.\nSCIENTIST: I'm really not sure why we're talking about brain physiology.\nWALTER: Dear God. How can you be so limited? When William Bell created this company, he knew one thing to be true. Brain and the mind are capable of so much. Don't you see that the brain is consciousness, hmm? The mind is god! There are no limits, except for those that we impose on ourselves. Open your eyes. Open, open. Inspiration is everywhere. Do you know how lucky you are to play in this sandbox? My heart is racing. God! Is anyone else hot in here? (starts to remove clothing)\nNINA: Uh, sorry to interrupt.\nWALTER: Oh, Peter, you're just in time for the good--\nPETER: Time to put your pants back on, Walter. We've got a case. We have to go.\nWALTER: Of course. I'll just get my things.\nNINA: He's a bit unorthodox.\nPETER: He's also trippin' his brains out right now. You know that, right?\nNINA: Mm.\nBROYLES: Van Horn was admitted at fourteen hundred hours. Newton came in fifteen minutes later and went on a shooting spree.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (security footage action) Look at that. It's like he's got no fear.\nBROYLES: Clearly, Van Horn was an operative of Newton's. We can only assume Newton knew Van Horn's identity as a shape-shifter would be revealed after he was injured in the crash.\nPETER: So Newton came here to retrieve him.\nBROYLES: And when he couldn't, he shut him up.\nWALTER: (to Bolivia) Oh, in the right light, your hair looks like strands of lemon diamonds.\nPETER: He self-medicated this morning.\nWALTER: Don't worry. I do some of my finest work self-medicated.\nBROYLES: Good, because not only was James Van Horn a sitting U.S. Senator with top level clearance, he was a good man. I want to know how long ago he was replaced by a shape-shifter and for what purpose. I want a full accounting of every committee he sat on, every classified briefing he had.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. Well, I'll make sure that his office is locked down.\nPETER: Broyles, if they can get to a sitting Senator, the whole government could be compromised.\nBROYLES: I know. I'm gonna call Dan Gilmore at the CDC and arrange blood tests for everyone on The Hill. Doctor Bishop?\nWALTER: Mm-hmm?\nBROYLES: Examine the body, see what you can find.\nWALTER: Of course. I think I'll go examine the body and see what I can find.\nFBI AGENT: So is it a machine?\nWALTER: No. Where can I purchase some candy buttons? Those little candies attached to rolls of paper. Do they still make those?\nFBI AGENT: I wouldn't know. I try not to eat sugar. So if it's not a machine, it's human?\nWALTER: (asks for tool) Nerve hook. To answer your question, it is neither -- and both. Part machine, part organic. A shape-shifter. Such an inspired creation. Frankly, I'm a little envious that Belly thought of it before I did.\nPETER: (joins the dissection) How's it going in here?\nWALTER: You'll be happy to know that having something to focus on is calming the vividness of my hallucinations.\nPETER: I think I'll probably be able to take it from here, Agent.\nFBI AGENT: Thank you.\nPETER: So, Walter.\nWALTER: I'm glad she's gone. Very negative energy.\nPETER: It seems pretty specific, don't you think, Walter? One shot, right through the eye?\nWALTER: That's a good question. Assuming that Newton shot the shape-shifter to incapacitate him, perhaps this is the location of some sort of power source.\nPETER: So assuming that you're right, Do you think we could fix it?\nWALTER: Fix him? We could try.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (answers phone from forested area) Yes?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What were you thinking?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Van Horn was in a car accident. He was a liability. I had to act quickly.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. What did he know?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: He was a senior operative. He knew everything.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Did he know about me?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Of course. Who do you think provided the information on Olivia Dunham and the Fringe team? Don't worry. He's been disabled. Or as you people call it, he's dead. He can't talk, and data recovery's impossible. Your cover's safe, for now.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What do you mean, my cover is safe for now?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I don't know what your mission is, Bolivia, and you've made it very clear that it's none of my concern. Whatever it is, I imagine it requires you to gain Peter Bishop's complete trust.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What makes you think that I don't already have it?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Well, maybe it's because I'm looking in from the outside, but I'm willing to wager that somewhere, deep inside his brain, Peter Bishop senses that something is not quite right with you, that something has changed, that you're not his Olivia.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, you need to remember who you're talking to.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: You're in over your head. You're not fully committed to this task, and because of that, you will fail. (hangs-up)\nWALTER: Did you know, in the nineteenth century, hat makers used mercury to flatten the fur on hat brims? Sadly, the mercury caused significant brain damage. Hence, where Lewis Carroll got the termMad Hatter.\nPETER: Thank you, Walter. That will be very helpful next time I'm on Jeopardy.\nWALTER: Eh! I can't animate this shape-shifter. Not here. Perhaps if we moved the body back to my lab --\nPETER: Sure, I'll have the body transferred back to Harvard right away.\nWALTER: No. My other lab. The equipment of Massive Dynamic is state of the art.\nPETER: Okay. I'll call Nina right now.\nWALTER: Uh-oh. I think I might be peaking again. Peter, perhaps Chamomile Tea would help.\nPETER: (as the shapeshifters left hand starts to twitch) Whoa, stop, stop. What'd you just do, Walter?\nWALTER: I must have triggered something.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (joins the duo) So how's it going in here?\nWALTER: Agent Dunham, good news. It seems this tin can is still kicking.\nASTRID: Agent Astrid Farnsworth. I'm here to see Doctor Bishop.\nFLOOR SECURITY: I've got an \"Astro\" Farnsworth.\nASTRID: That's me, mm-hmm. (delivers storage box to Walter, watches the dissection continue as probes are inserted) You know, the old me would have been really disgusted by that.\nWALTER: Eh, finally. Did you get everything on the list?\nASTRID: I don't even want to know.\nWALTER: Which one are you referring to?\nASTRID: Both.\nWALTER: Ha. Did you get the candy buttons?\nASTRID: Yeah, do you really think that he's--\nWALTER: They're for me.\nASTRID: Okay. Now, do you mind telling me what all this stuff is for?\nWALTER: We're making a treasure map. Somewhere inside this creature is a data storage unit, And now that he's alive, I'm going to find it. Using those items as visual stimuli, we are going to map its neural pathways--well, what we would think of as its brain.\nASTRID: And what are we hoping to find?\nWALTER: Its memories, Astrid. Everything it knows. Who it was working for. If there were others. You look shocked.\nASTRID: You just called me Astrid. You never get my name right.\nWALTER: Must be the LSD.\nSENATOR'S AIDE: These are Senator Van Horn's Homeland Security briefings, going back three years.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Great. Thank you. (to Peter) You know, I can handle this, If you want to go check on Walter and see how he's doing.\nPETER: Astrid must be there by now. If they've learned anything, I'm sure they'll call.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The Senator made requests for classified intelligence twenty-nine times last month.\nPETER: There's nothing here. (searches desk area)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, if he's like the other shape-shifters, He's gonna be careful. He's not gonna leave anything here that would tell us he wasn't the Senator.\nPETER: Except for one thing. He didn't know that today was the day he was gonna die. Unless he had someone come in here and clean up after him, there's got to be something.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (looks at ringing cell phone. to Peter) It's Rachel. I should take this.\nPETER: Tell her I said hi.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Heh. (walks to the hallway and answers call from Newton) Hey, Rache, what's up?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Do you know it's customary to leave one message, and the caller will get back to you? Not thirty.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: He's alive. Van Horn is alive.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: That's impossible.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You underestimated them. He's on the Twenty-Third Floor of Massive Dynamic. Doctor Bishop's working on him now.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I'll take care of it.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You had better.\nPETER: Hey, I think I found something. (jimmies open lock box)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What is it?\nPETER: (removes images and files from the box) It's you. You... and me... and Walter-- all of us. Every case we ever worked on. He knew everything.\nLISA DUFFY: (tending to her fussy eater during family dinner) You want to pretend the train's going into the station?\nNATE DUFFY: (proud whine) I'm seven and a half, Mom.\nRAY DUFFY: (proud defender) You forget you're dealing with a very mature young man here. (knock on the front door) Ah, I'll tell them we don't want any. (to Nate) Come on, asparagus, it's great. And it'll make your pee smell funny. Real funny.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (after Ray opens the door and looses his smile) Hello, Ray. I have an assignment for you. (hands file over on Van Horn) The body's in the lab on the Twenty-Third Floor.\nRAY DUFFY: You expect me to break into Massive Dynamic?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Oh, you don't have to. Just shift into a new body assigned to you still, someone with clearance. It shouldn't be a problem. Is it?\nRAY DUFFY: No. I'm just surprised. I haven't seen you in five years.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Oh, you know, that's the way it works. After this mission, you'll take a new identity. And Ray? No traces left behind. Nothing that can expose us. Understood?\nRAY DUFFY: (disheartened) I'll contact you when it's done.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Good.\n(Broyles, Bolivia and Peter enter Massive Dynamic through the security checkpoint)\nBROYLES: I've got Bureau Agents stationed throughout the building, and an NYPD security detail has set up a perimeter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So what makes you think that Newton would try to recover the shape-shifter?\nBROYLES: I'd rather be wrong than sorry.\nWALTER: (exits the elevator and approaches. to Broyles. trying to get his attention) Good, I heard you were back.\nPETER: Hold on a second, Walter, hold on. According to the files in Van Horn's office, he's been collecting intel on us for the last two years, which suggests when he was shifted.\nBROYLES: Besides Newton, anything about other shape-shifters? Anything that would tell us who they're working with, how they get their orders?\nPETER: No.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So did you find anything in D.C.?\nBROYLES: We ran blood tests on every person who works on The Hill. Everyone checks out.\nPETER: What about the DoD and FBI? The shape-shifters could have infiltrated their ranks too.\nBROYLES: We're testing everyone with a level four classification or above.\nPETER: No, we've got to go wider. Van Horn can't be the only mole. There's just no way--\nWALTER: Maybe we should just ask him.\nBROYLES: What?\nWALTER: That's what I've been trying to say. If you want to know who the shape-shifter's been working with, I think we should just ask him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Is it even possible that there's recoverable data left in Van Horn?\nASTRID: Walter thinks so. We've been trying various techniques to locate it. At first, we did not have very much luck. With everyday objects, the shape-shifters only had a minimal reaction. But then we tried something more personal.\nWALTER: Watch the monitors closely. Here's what happens when I show it a toy car. No neural activity. But when I show a photograph of the Senator's wife...\nBROYLES: So those areas are where the data is?\nASTRID: No, we haven't found any data storage.\nWALTER: Not yet, we haven't, but I believe we can continue to revive the neural pathways by playing upon this emotional tie.\nPETER: I'm not following, Walter. It's a machine.\nWALTER: Yes, and to succeed in its mission, it needed to play the role of a spouse. And pretending to have an emotional connection caused a real one to form. The ability to process complex emotions is built into the machine's operating system. We just needed a stronger trigger to find the data. We need to use Van Horn's wife.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, I don't think we can ask that of a civilian, Walter. I mean, not to mention the security clearance it would require.\nWALTER: It's the only way.\nPETER: Broyles, I know she's a friend of yours, but if we could get at that data--\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't think it's a good idea. Imagine the panic if she talks to the press.\nBROYLES: I've known Patricia Van Horn for most of my adult life. Her character's beyond question. If she's willing to help us, I'm willing to trust her.\nRAY DUFFY: Hey, buddy, what are you still doing up?\nNATE DUFFY: I didn't sound the monster alarm, but I think he's here.\nRAY DUFFY: Where?\nNATE DUFFY: Under the bed.\nRAY DUFFY: You know... sometimes... monsters aren't all that bad. Sometimes... if you get to spend some time with them, they can be very surprising. They can be, um, incredibly sweet and pure and capable of great, great love. And then, one of them might actually become your very, very best friend.\nNATE DUFFY: But you're my best friend.\nRAY DUFFY: Yeah, that's right.\nNATE DUFFY: Are you going to work?\nRAY DUFFY: Yeah.\nNATE DUFFY: Come check on me when you get back?\nRAY DUFFY: I will.\nBROYLES: Patricia, this is Agent Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hello.\nPETER: Hi.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Hello.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I know that what we're asking you to do Is difficult.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Frankly, it all seems a bit beyond comprehension. Last week was our granddaughter's first birthday. You should have seen the way Jim held her in his arms. He was so happy. And now, the thought that he was really this thing.\nBROYLES: Patricia, if this is too much for you.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: No. I want to be here. I want to know who did this to my husband.\nPETER: Well, that's what we're hoping to find out too.\nBROYLES: You ready?\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: I'm ready. Hi, James. It's me, Patricia. Can you hear me? Is -- is that what you want?\nWALTER: Oh, it's perfect. But if you could please talk to him and not at him.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Okay. It's quiet in the house without you. I finished the curtains. I can't sleep. It's just something to do.\nWALTER: No, no, no, this is not good. Um... maybe if you could touch him. Um, perhaps a gentle caress or tickle.\nBROYLES: Excuse me?\nWALTER: Uh, I'm just suggesting possible ways--\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: No, it--it's okay. I understand. Jim... the kids have been asking for you. Grayson called yesterday.\nASTRID: Neural activity is rising.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Lucy said her first word. \"shoes.\"\nWALTER: It's working. We're close.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: I've been thinking of all the years we had. I know it wasn't always easy. I'm sorry I didn't know... you were gone. I - I don't know how I didn't know. You would have known. I-I know you would have.\nASTRID: Walter, the lower base of his spine.\nWALTER: No, something's wrong. It doesn't make any sense.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: I don't know if you can ever forgive me, but I - I'm so sor--\nVAN HORN CORPSE: 11, 10, 12, Whitefield. 11, 13, 16, Beaufain.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Walter, what's happening?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nVAN HORN CORPSE: 11, 17, Essex.\nASTRID: It could be cipher text, like a code, maybe.\nPETER: No, he's on a loop.\nVAN HORN CORPSE: 11, 13...\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Stop it!\nBROYLES: That's enough!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What was that?\nWALTER: I don't know. Maybe we triggered a corrupted file, A mishmash of discarded data.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: No. I know what that was. Next month was our anniversary. The Beaufain, the Whitefield, the Essex, they're all hotels. We were leaving November tenth.\nBROYLES: We're done here. Let me take you home.\nPATRICIA VAN HORN: Did it help? Did you find what you were looking for?\nBROYLES: You've done more than enough.\nWALTER: It's no use.\nPETER: There has to be a way to salvage more data.\nWALTER: The shape-shifter's system's too badly damaged. Any data in there is likely lost.\n(Bolivia reads text message from Unknown - \"Get Out. ETA 15 minutes.\"\nWALTER: One thing I do know for sure, I am no longer high.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Walter, why don't we take a break and get something to eat?\nWALTER: I don't have an appetite.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, maybe just a change of scenery might clear your head, make you feel better.\nWALTER: I suppose so.\nASTRID: Walter, I thought you said you weren't hungry?\nWALTER: I'm eating for comfort. To think what I put that poor woman through, and the most activity we saw occurred in the shape-shifter's ass.\nASTRID: It was his lower spine, Walter. Look, animal cookies. You love these.\nWALTER: (cranky) No, Belly loved them. I occasionally eat them to honor him, that is all.\nASTRID: Walter, I'm just trying to cheer you up.\nWALTER: Thank you. Belly always thought that dinosaur cookies would have been a better idea. Velociraptor, mm! Dilophosaurus, yum!\nASTRID: You know, I was more of a stegosaurus fan myself.\nWALTER: That was Belly's favorite too. The funny thing about stegosaurus...\nASTRID: Walter? Walter, what just happened?\nWALTER: I'll be right back. Oh, don't eat my pudding.\nASTRID: Okay.\nWALTER: Did you know that the stegosaurus had a brain in its ass? Why didn't I think of it? The stegosaurus has a massive cluster of nerves above the rump, the sacral ganglion. Evolutionary leap. Separating short-term memory from long-term memory. Belly, you ingenious son of a bitch.\n(Walter chatters in front of the police officer that joined him on his elevator trip back to the lab. Officer Ray Duffy remains silent as he removes his shape changing device)\nFLOOR SECURITY: (as the new boss exits the elevator) Doctor Bishop, go right ahead.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nFLOOR SECURITY: (to the uniformed officer that saunters off of the elevator seconds later) You're not authorized to be up here. Police are strictly working the lobby. Sir.\nPETER: (sitting in the cafeteria. thinking aloud) Patricia Van Horn was living with a shape-shifter for two years. She must have noticed something different.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, shape-shifters are good at their job, you know?\nPETER: I've been thinking about it. Maybe she did notice, and she just made excuses for herself not to have to deal with it. (reflective) Or she came up with ways to explain it to herself. Kind of like I've been doing with you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: With me?\nPETER: Yeah. (smiles with his eyes) With all the little differences ever since you got back from the other side. And you did tell me that your experiences on the other side changed you, but since you got back, it's like... it's like you're a completely different person. You seem less burdened. You're more patient with Walter. Don't get me wrong, I like it. The change is good. But... it's different.\nASTRID: Hey. (joins the table with her food. sits)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey.\nPETER: Hey.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Where's Walter?\nASTRID: I don't know. He said he'd be right back.\nWALTER: (after flipping the disabled Van Horn on his side. cuts to remove the memory chip. hears footsteps and assumes) Astrid, I need you to adjust that light.\nRAY DUFFY: (pointing his pistol at the back of Walter\u2019s head) Step away from him.\nWALTER: (turns and is startled) Oh, oh!\nRAY DUFFY: Stay right there. Don't move.\nWALTER: It was in his spine. I was right.\nRAY DUFFY: Yeah, you were right. (just as Walter stabs him with a large amputation scalpel. turns and strikes Walter powerfully. sends Walter flying head first into a metal crossbeam)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (tapping at the elevator call button) Look, he's probably just gone to the restroom or something.\nPETER: No, he left his pudding. (not jokingly) Something must be wrong.\nRAY DUFFY: (bumping the team as he exits the elevator for the lobby doors) Excuse me.\nPETER: (as the doors close) Hey! That cop, it must have been him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, you look for Walter, I'll go after the shape-shifter. (leaves the elevator in not so swift pursuit)\nPETER: (exits the elevator onto Walter\u2019s floor and finds the security man down. rushes to the main lab) Walter? Walter! Walter. (revives the senior scientist with a few soft slaps to the cheek) Walter, look at me. Hey, Walter? Walter!\nWALTER: Hey son? The stegosaurus, Peter. It has two brains. That's what they were after.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (joins the Bishops as Walter recovers) I, uh, I couldn't find him. So is he alright?\nPETER: He took a pretty bad knock on the head.\nWALTER: I'll be fine.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (calls on cell phone) Uh, this is Dunham. We're on Floor Twenty-Three. I need the EMTs here now, please.\nWALTER: Listen to me. There was someone here.\nPETER: We know, Walter. There was a shape-shifter here.\nWALTER: And they took what we were after. They took the data out of Van Horn.\nASTRID: (runs into the lab concerned) Walter? Walter, oh, my gawd!\nWALTER: What?\nASTRID: Walter, are you okay?\nWALTER: Under the circumstances, I'm fine. I could have been killed.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (as Peter starts to type at a nearby workstation) What are you doing?\nPETER: The security cameras. If we can I.D. the shape-shifter, maybe we can catch him before he changes bodies. Oh, come on. (when he is denied security access)\nWALTER: Peter. (steps-in and gains access with his biometric thumbprint) Ownership has its privileges.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (as he agent returns home and parks in the driveway) You didn't shift.\nRAY DUFFY: I didn't have to. I got it. (hands-over the memory device)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Don't worry about them. I took care of it. We're clean.\nRAY DUFFY: (angered) Why did you do that?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: I didn't. I couldn't understand your hesitation. I saw it, but I didn't understand it. I do now. It's -- it's them, isn't it?\nRAY DUFFY: I got the disk. I found a way...\nTHOMAS NEWTON: ...and now it's time for you to move on.\nRAY DUFFY: No. This is my life...\nTHOMAS NEWTON: ... and now you'll have another life, just like you had another one before. This is simply a way station for you. A stop along the way. It's what we do. It's what we're made for. (calm, but concerned he is losing an asset)\nRAY DUFFY: No, no, no. (genuinely attached to the family of the officer he murdered) It means so much to me and I've come to mean so much to them. How can you ask me to give them up?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: Well, I suppose I can't. (turns away, turns back and shoots Ray in the forehead)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (arrives at Duffy's with Peter just as Newton is stuffing Duffy into the trunk of his car) Keep your hands where I can see them! (fires wildly as Newton races off)\n(after a lengthy chase through the wet streets and light evening traffic, Newton swerves in a tunnel and rolls his vehicle. Bolivia approaches the wreck with her pistol drawn)\nPETER: (to drivers nearby) Get back in your car! (on cell phone) I need to reach Agent Broyles. It's urgent.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (opens the door and revives the motionless spy) Newton. Newton, where is it?\nPETER: (shouting from nearby) Is he alive?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (quietly to Newton) Where is it? (loudly to Peter) He's breathing. Yeah.\nPETER: Does he have the disk?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (after she removes it from his pocket) I can't find it, but, uh, we can search properly when I get him into custody. (looks her co-conspirator in the eye and silently agree that Plan B is now in effect)\nPETER: Alright.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (sitting on a bunk, he looks up after his leader opens the viewing slit in the heavy door) Is the Van Horn disk secure?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It is. (places a small metallic wafer in the pass-through)\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (approaches. picks up the wafer and studies it) You're gonna have a very difficult time without me, you know?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, there are plenty of machines here. (sardonically) I can befriend a vacuum cleaner.\nTHOMAS NEWTON: You're very good at that.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: At what?\nTHOMAS NEWTON: (confident she lacks the ruthlessness and moral aversion to accomplish their mission) At continuing to try to convince yourself that you don't care. But you do care, don't you? Every night when your head hits the pillow, in the last moments before you go to sleep, your emotions betray you, and you question your ability to pull this off. Words like, integrity, self-respect - they haunt you. They form a line that you're unwilling to cross and that will lead to your undoing. But I suppose that's not my problem anymore.\n(she slams the slide shut and marches from the area. time to prove him wrong)\nBARTENDER: Here you go. (to Peter, as he receives a late night text invitation to Dunham's apartment - she needs to talk)\n(Newton sits in his cell, studies the wafer again and dutifully swallows it)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers the knock at her door after putting on her game face) I lied to you.\nPETER: About what?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (with a provocative smile, she tugs him through the door by the lapels... confident that she will cross any line she has to in order to accomplish her mission) Uh... I don't want to talk. (the lust train backs into a nearby wall and lips collide in a romantic embrace)\n(Newton convulses to the floor in his holding cell... permanently disabled as he becomes motionless in a pool of his own mercurial fluids)\n(Dunham's boudoir becomes the hub of romantic activity as clothing is shed and colleagues get horizontal)"

Is that a lingering symptom?\nBRANDON: You are recovering from a severe mental break, Agent Dunham-- I have to ask you these questions.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I know.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Please accept my apologies for the poking and prodding, Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Uh, Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You look well.\nOLIVIA: I am. Good as new.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Did you get the dossier I sent over?\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir. So you really believe that the other Olivia Dunham can cross between universes.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It would appear so. Thus far, we've developed some means of our own, but each of them has dangerous side effects. But it seems their Olivia can travel between worlds safely, which is the real reason you're here today. We believe you may be able to do the same.\nOLIVIA: How would I be able to do that?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I don't know... yet. But with your permission, we'd like to put you through a series of experiments to see if we're right. I'm sure you understand... what this would mean to our cause. We'd be able to defend ourselves against the other side. But... I know you've been through a lot, Olivia. So if you're not up to it, you should just say so.\nPETER (as a vision): You can take as many pills as you want. I'm not going anywhere.\nOLIVIA: You're not here.\nPETER (as a vision): Look, I understand why you agreed to take the test. You just want things to go back to normal, to be the Olivia that you think you should be, but unfortunately, that's not gonna happen. Because you're not their Olivia. And you can keep on telling yourself that you're fine, but you're not fine. You're not sleeping. And I'm not a lingering symptom. You can't ignore me.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Alright, easy. Got it?\nMARK WILNER: Yep.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Careful. I said careful!\nMARK WILNER: Have your gun?\nJOSHUA ROSE: Okay, ready? Uhh! I got it. He's not breathing.\nMARK WILNER: He's dead.\nJOSHUA ROSE: No, he's not dead. Gimme-- gimme the syringe. Gimme the syringe! Come on, buddy, come on. Come on, come on, come on.\nMARK WILNER: Nothing.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Come on! Come on!\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Warning. Quarantine area breach.\nMARK WILNER: The cops are gonna be here any minute. We gotta move.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Breathe! Come on, breathe! Come on! Okay, you're okay. Cut him out, cut him out! You okay?\nMARK WILNER: Okay, give me a minute. We're gonna cut you out, okay?\nJOSHUA ROSE: Come on, pick it up! Wilner. Wilner!\nMARK WILNER: Oh, god.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Here. Pull. Come on, come on, pull. Just pull. Come on! Pull, come on, pull! Come on, man, come on, come on, pull!\nMARK WILNER: Help me. Please!\nJOSHUA ROSE: Wilner, I'm sorry. He's my brother.\nMARK WILNER: No! Please! Don't leave me!\nLINCOLN LEE: Homemade laser knife.\nAGENT FRANCIS: It's clean. There's no fingerprints.\nLINCOLN LEE: Pretty sophisticated tech for looters.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Well, you gotta hand it to 'em. No one's ever removed anything from the quarantine zone, yet they keep trying.\nLINCOLN LEE: Lotta purses and wallets in there. Like Cary Grant said... \"the stuff that dreams are made of.\"\nAGENT FRANCIS: Oh...\nLINCOLN LEE: You got something?\nAGENT FRANCIS: I don't know yet. I'll be right back.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nLINCOLN LEE: Well, look who's here.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Traffic.\nLINCOLN LEE: Third time this week. You gotta stop taking the Nixon Parkway.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nLINCOLN LEE: You okay? You seem a little run down.\nOLIVIA: Oh, yeah. Frank's on assignment, and I never sleep very well when he's away. So you gonna bring me up to speed?\nAUTOMATED NARRATIVE: \u2026in 1989, these isolated tears in the fabric of our universe began to increase in frequency. Some of them expanded into micro black holes with devastating consequences. To contain these events, scientists designed a quarantine protocol using a chemical substance, Amber 31422.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright, just fast forward.\nAGENT #1: What are you looking for?\nAGENT FRANCIS: I was just watching this a couple of weeks ago. I just... remember something a little differently. Right there. Freeze it. Thanks. Four years ago, this station was sealed. Now it looks like we have a new addition. Meet our thief.\nLINCOLN LEE: Must have gotten caught in the reseal.\nOLIVIA: Mark Wilner. Couple counts of burglary. You know, breaking into amber seems awfully ambitious for a small-time crook.\nLINCOLN LEE: Something tells me he wasn't after purses.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: So this is where the powerful hide out.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Just those that need to do some thinking before they head home. Thank you for meeting me. Understand you're working on a case-- a man removed from amber.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Franklin Street Station. We're trying to determine why someone would go to all that trouble to steal him.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: When I first... developed the amber, the universe was degrading at an alarming rate. People were becoming afraid to leave their homes. I remember the first time we instigated the protocol. It was... October 17, 1989. I remember I awoke... particularly happy that day. And then there was the breach at Harvard Yard.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: If we hadn't contained it, half of Boston would have been swallowed up.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Sixty three civilians were trapped in amber that day... and all the hundreds since. It sickens me.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Sir... It's a tragic, but a small price to pay for the greater good. People understand that.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Perhaps. But if they were to find out that the amber victims could be removed and resuscitated, I'm afraid the outcry would be akin to revolt.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Quarantine victims are alive?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Theoretically. But to remove them would weaken the structural integrity of the amber.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: We'll recover them before anyone finds out, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Oh, and another thing. Olivia Dunham has agreed to submit to the tests developed by Science Division. As I've said, these... tests are stressful. If she becomes unstable in any way--\nCOLONEL BROYLES: If I see any unusual behavior, I'll let you know.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Nature doesn't recognize good and evil, Phillip. Nature only recognizes balance and imbalance. I intend to restore balance to our world. Whatever it takes.\nOLIVIA: Really? You never did that before?\nLINCOLN LEE: Make my own popsicles?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. My mom used to have these plastic molds, and you'd pour fruit juice into them and then stick them in the freezer.\nAGENT FRANCIS: My mom...\nOLIVIA: mm?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Made me get her cigarettes.\nLINCOLN LEE: Aw!\nOLIVIA: Aw!\nAGENT FRANCIS: Ah. So who's the popsicle?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Joshua Rose. I worked his case with Fringe Division four years ago. He's a bank robber.\nOLIVIA: Well, why would Fringe Division be appointed to investigate a robber?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Rose used some kind of device that allowed him to access the vaults without setting off the bank alarms. But what it also did was cause molecular degradation.\nLINCOLN LEE: Man-made breaches. We studied that case back at the Academy. You guys had to quarantine what-- half a dozen areas?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: One for every job Rose pulled. The bank above Franklin Station was Rose's last job. He got caught in the quarantine. Now, it's possible that he was taken out in order to be revived.\nLINCOLN LEE: Revived?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What I'm about to tell you is classified. The people entombed in Amber are in a state of suspended animation.\nOLIVIA: Sir. If people knew that their loved ones were still alive in there--\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I understand, Agent Dunham. Which is why we need to recover Rose, whatever state he's in, as soon as possible. He had an apartment that was sealed after he was ambered. Start there.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Shh, shh, shh. Just rest. You'll be fine. Just needs time to recover, Danielle.\nAGENT FRANCIS: My first partner got caught in an amber quarantine in Boston. His little girl just turned six last week. If I get ambered... just leave me in there.\nPETER (as a vision): Does that feel familiar? Two people who look exactly alike.\nLINCOLN LEE: You find anything?\nOLIVIA: What do we know about Rose's family?\nLINCOLN LEE: Never married. No kids. Parents are dead. He has a brother Matthew, an accountant. Broyles said he was very cooperative in their investigation.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Uh, maybe we should talk to him again.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, guys. Jackpot. Anybody recognize any of this stuff?\nLINCOLN LEE: Some of it. Ion lasers. Pneumo drills. Some kinda gas. Looks like he was trying to build some kind of Negative Matter Ring.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay, Mister Wizard. Some of us don't have a fancy degree.\nLINCOLN LEE: Creates high frequency vibrations. Which could weaken the atomic structure of the bank's walls. That would explain how Rose was able to get inside.\nAGENT FRANCIS: He walked through walls?\nLINCOLN LEE: It's possible.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay, now I know you pulled that outta your ass.\nOLIVIA: Shh! Listen.\nLINCOLN LEE: Go! Now!\nNURSE ALICE: This might sting a bit.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nLINCOLN LEE: Dinner is on me tonight, Liv. Evvia, Pimlico. Whatever you want.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Big spender. What's the occasion?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Olivia saved our lives. She heard the bomb before it went off, and we had enough time to get out the apartment.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Good work, Agent.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, sir.\nLINCOLN LEE: You I.D. the symbol on those tanks?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Ferrocene. It's a compound used in Negative Matter Rings.\nLINCOLN LEE: Oh ho! What did I say?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Anyone ever tell you gloating isn't attractive?\nNURSE MAUD: Hold still, Agent Francis.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Oh!\nNURSE ALICE: That looks pretty bad. Why don't you take this off? I'll get the doctor.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv? Soon as we're done, we're gonna go talk to Joshua Rose's brother.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nJOSHUA ROSE: You got it? I'll be right back, alright? I'll be right back.\nLINCOLN LEE: Matthew Rose?\nJOSHUA ROSE: Yeah. What can I do for you?\nLINCOLN LEE: Agent Lee, Fringe Division. This is Agent Dunham.\nJOSHUA ROSE: What's goin' on?\nLINCOLN LEE: What we're about to ask you is classified. It's about your brother Joshua... any idea about his whereabouts?\nJOSHUA ROSE: You know, four years ago you people told me that he was trapped in amber. You telling me you were wrong?\nLINCOLN LEE: We can't go into detail. But if we were wrong, would he contact you?\nJOSHUA ROSE: My-- my brother-- ripped families apart, okay? Mothers and husbands trapped in amber because of the crimes he committed. He'd know better than to contact me. Do you have any idea what it was like for me when Joshua's face started showing up on the news? I mean, every time I went to the market, to a movie, take my kids to Little League... people would look at me and see him.\nOLIVIA: That must have been very difficult for you.\nJOSHUA ROSE: You know, just because we look alike, it doesn't mean we have anything in common.\nLINCOLN LEE: We appreciate your time, Mister Rose. If you hear anything...\nJOSHUA ROSE: Yeah.\nLINCOLN LEE: And all this time I thought my brother was a pain in the ass.\nOLIVIA: Oh... gotta go to the DoD. They're ready for me.\nLINCOLN LEE: You sure you're up for this? I mean, you just started back to work.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I can handle it. But thank you... Mom.\nMATTHEW ROSE: Where's Danielle?\nJOSHUA ROSE: She, uh... she's at the store. She's gonna be back in a minute. I don't know how to say this, but-- you, uh... you came to the bank to try and stop me, but you were too late. I mean, I didn't know. I couldn't know you were coming. You were trying to stop me from robbing a bank, and I ended up stealing your life. But you're free now. It took me longer than I thought, but I never gave up.\nMATTHEW ROSE: How are our boys?\nDANIELLE ROSE: They're so big, you're not gonna believe it. They're giants. It's okay. It's okay.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Genetically, you're exact replicas, you and the other Olivia. Which means, theoretically, you both should be capable of the same thing. In the isolation tank, you'll be freed from sensory distractions, so the part of your brain which enables you to travel between universes should be more accessible. And we will help the process along by giving you a number of psychotropic drugs.\nBRANDON: There's a speaker in the tank, so you'll be able to hear us. And we'll be monitoring you closely.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You ready?\nOLIVIA: Just like riding the roller coaster at Coney Island, right?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Close it. Olivia, can you hear me? We'll start the drugs now. Now we wait.\nBRANDON: It's not working.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Increase the doses. 5,000 milligrams of Neurontin, 2,000 Elavil.\nBRANDON: Sir, are you really--\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Only those who risk going too far find out how far they can go. Do it.\nBRANDON: Oh, hell! uh... her heart rate is 183. Blood pressure is falling.\nCONCERNED MOM: Cameron. I told you not to touch anything.\nOLIVIA: I went somewhere. To a gift shop. There was... a boy.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It worked! She crossed over.\nPETER (in a vision): Makes sense now, doesn't it? Why they needed you to take their test voluntarily. Why they needed you to believe that you were their Olivia. They know you can cross over. You've done it before. That's how you ended up here in the first place.\nOLIVIA: Mom. Hey.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Hi.\nOLIVIA: Come in.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: It's Tuesday.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Oh! Lunch. I'm sorry. It just slipped my mind. It's just been really hectic and... yeah. You know. Frank does most of the real cleaning around here.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: He's still away.\nOLIVIA: He's still in North Texas trying to put a stop to that smallpox outbreak, so...\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Olive... is everything okay?\nOLIVIA: Oh... Mom, I'm just tired, and I keep seeing--\nPETER (in a vision): I knew a pair of twins in high school... Nina and Gina. One of them was always so much brighter than the other one, but they both managed to get straight A's. I'll give you one guess how they did that.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: I asked you when is he coming back in town?\nOLIVIA: Mom, I've gotta go. Um... I'm sorry. Do you mind if you-- if you let yourself out?\nOLIVIA: Sir? Uh... they switched.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Who?\nOLIVIA: The twins. When we spoke to Matthew Rose today, when he was talking about Joshua's crimes, he wasn't angry or-- or upset. He was... ashamed. It- it wasn't like he was embarrassed. It was more like he was guilty.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You think Joshua Rose was pretending to be his brother.\nOLIVIA: I think the man we spoke to today committed those crimes. I think that they switched on us.\n(later, in the interrogation room)\nMATTHEW ROSE: What is this about?\nLINCOLN LEE: Identical twins have the same DNA. But fingerprints and retinas are unique.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: He's who he says he is. He's Matthew Rose.\nOLIVIA: No. Something's not right.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham, it was just a hunch.\nOLIVIA: They switched again.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv--\nOLIVIA: I'll prove it to you.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham.\nOLIVIA: You switched with your brother.\nMATTHEW ROSE: What are you talking about?\nOLIVIA: You know exactly what I'm talking about.\nLINCOLN LEE: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Hang on. Okay, we went to your house yesterday. What did we talk about?\nMATTHEW ROSE: What?\nOLIVIA: At your house. What... did we talk about?\nMATTHEW ROSE: Your partner did most of the talking. I told you how hard it was for me and my family when Joshua was robbing banks.\nOLIVIA: He told him. What we looked like, what we talked about. They're in this together. His brother told him.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham.\nOLIVIA: They're messing with us. They switched.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham. Outside.\nOLIVIA: He's lying. And you can't prove that I'm wrong.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: We can't prove you're right either.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv--\nOLIVIA: ...they're twins. Are you telling me that it's not in the realm of possibility that they took each other's place?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Look, even if you're right, we can't hold him on a hunch.\nAGENT: Colonel, you've got a visitor upstairs.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Colonel Broyles, I'm not sure if you remember me.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Of course, Missus Dunham. What can I do for you?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Olivia would be furious with me, but... I think she went back to work too soon. She just hasn't been herself and... I'm worried that there's something wrong.\nLINCOLN LEE: Hey. You okay?\nOLIVIA: I mean, that depends. Do you believe me?\nLINCOLN LEE: Break-in at Langdon Chemical two weeks ago. Guess what they stole?\nOLIVIA: Three tanks of Ferrocene.\nLINCOLN LEE: Who uses Ferrocene again?\nOLIVIA: So Joshua Rose is planning another heist. Uh-- sir.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Lee, go check it out. Take Francis.\nOLIVIA: Oh... D-don't do this to me. Please don't take me off the case.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I think you've been pushed too hard. Go.\nOLIVIA: Sir, I'm not crazy. I know I'm right about this.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham...\nOLIVIA: If I could just follow it through, I--\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham... go home.\nJOSHUA ROSE: How'd it go?\nMATTHEW ROSE: They know. One of the agents, she knows, man. She knows it was you who spoke to her at the house and we switched.\nJOSHUA ROSE: But they let you go?\nMATTHEW ROSE: Yeah.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Matty, are you being followed?\nMATTHEW ROSE: I don't see anyone.\nJOSHUA ROSE: You wouldn't see anybody. That's the point.\nMATTHEW ROSE: What are we gonna do?\nJOSHUA ROSE: Just, um... run some errands. Go get a cup of tea. Just don't come home yet. I need a couple of hours. I'll take care of this.\nMATTHEW ROSE: How?\nJOSHUA ROSE: Just do what I said. It wasn't supposed to be like this. They weren't supposed to be this close. Look, I'm doing my best here-- you know that.\nDANIELLE ROSE: Do you know what it was like for him? In the amber? Did he tell you? Well, he told me. He was aware of every moment. His mind was stuck in the last thought he had before he was trapped. This horrible feeling of fear... and loss. Wondering about his family, how we would get along. Can you imagine that?\nJOSHUA ROSE: I have a plan.\nDANIELLE ROSE: Oh. What? You gonna rob a bank? One last score to get lost and stay lost, Joshua? If you really cared about him, you would turn yourself in, because that is the only way out of this.\nOLDEST ROSE BOY: Oh, nice goal! Whoo!\nOLIVIA: Agent Farnsworth, would you mind taking a look at something for me? If Joshua Rose was about to hit another bank, where would it be, given his profile and M.O.?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I ran that scenario for Agent Lee an hour ago.\nOLIVIA: I understand, but would you mind taking another look for me?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: There are thirty-seven likely targets based on that criteria.\nOLIVIA: Okay, what assumptions did you make?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Assuming that Joshua Rose was taken out of the amber, necessary parameters would include a subterranean vault, a minimum of $50,000, proper getaway routes...\nOLIVIA: ...wait--sorry. Assuming that Joshua was removed from the amber? We know that he was taken out of the amber.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: We know that someone was taken from the amber. Joshua's a twin. There's a fifty percent chance that his brother was in amber and that Joshua broke him out.\nOLIVIA: And Joshua is a brilliant criminal with expertise in breaking into impenetrable areas. Matthew is an accountant.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so if it was Matthew who was in the amber, then Joshua's M.O. may have changed.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I don't follow your logic.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I think I spoke to Joshua yesterday. He was clearly ashamed. I mean, if he spent the past four years living with the guilt of trapping his brother in amber, then he's not gonna want to hurt people like that again.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Less human traffic. A remote area. Reduced collateral damage. That would narrow the list of likely targets down to three-- three banks.\nMALE TECHNICIAN: Anomalous energy signature detected. Class Two breach.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Where's the location?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Parameters match events from 2006. Seventy-nine percent probability it was caused by Joshua Rose.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I need a location.\nFEMALE TECHNICIAN: Riverdale Mutual. The Bronx.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Let's go, people.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: She was right.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Who?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Agent Dunham.\nLINCOLN LEE: I want science and risk reports now!\nAGENT FRANCIS: That's Olivia's car.\nLINCOLN LEE: Chief! Molecular degradation is increasing. We're looking at a two hundred meter quarantine.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Set a perimeter.\nLINCOLN LEE: Best way in is through the main entrance. I want three canisters in the main lobby. A three-point spread with dispersion tubes to the basement and the second floor.\nAGENT FRANCIS: We got a busted lock on a subway gate. She could be down there.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: She could be anywhere. The quarantine protocol's already in place.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Sir, if she's in there...\nCOLONEL BROYLES: ...it's a Class Two breach. We have to seal it before we lose this whole block.\nLINCOLN LEE: Five minutes. Give us five minutes.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You got three.\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Warning. Quarantine protocol imminent. Evacuate the area immediately. Warning. Protocol initiation imminent.\nJOSHUA ROSE: What are you doing here?\nMATTHEW ROSE: I found the blueprints. Realized what you're up to, and I can't... let you do this again.\nLINCOLN LEE: Olivia!\nAGENT FRANCIS: Dunham!\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv!\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Massive loss of life will result. Warning.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright, we've got to move.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Wait. Joshua Rose is in there--\nLINCOLN LEE: We gotta go!\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Quarantine protocol initiated.\nOLIVIA: Rose is in there--\nLINCOLN LEE: We gotta go!\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Massive loss of life will result.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Matt, you gotta leave. There's no time for this. You gotta go right now.\nMATTHEW ROSE: You don't need the money!\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Massive loss of life will result.\nMATTHEW ROSE: Where are your tools?\nJOSHUA ROSE: Unless they think they have me, they'll never stop.\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Thirty seconds remaining.\nJOSHUA ROSE: There's no other way. If I turn myself in, they'll figure it out-- They'll know I wasn't the one in the amber. They'll take you. You're the only person alive that survived the quarantine. They'll experiment on you for the rest of your life. You know that.\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Warning. Twenty seconds to quarantine.\nJOSHUA ROSE: Matty... Matt, you gotta go. I'm not taking your life twice.\nAUTOMATED ALERT: Ten seconds to quarantine.\nMATTHEW ROSE: Josh... no...\nJOSHUA ROSE: Matt... let me do this one good thing.\nAGENT #1: Quarantine protocol complete. One casualty. Joshua Rose.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Let's clean up and go home. Dunham, you hang back. Are you aware of how many protocols you broke?\nAUTOMATED ALERT: ...this area is quarantined. You have no access at this time. No access.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Good work.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, Colonel\nAUTOMATED ALERT: ...we appreciate your cooperation. This area is now under quarantine.\nLINCOLN LEE: Okay?\nAUTOMATED ALERT: ...all civilians must now evacuate the area. This area is now under quarantine.\nOLIVIA: Hello. We found your brother. And I'm sorry to say he was caught in a quarantine protocol last night.\nMATTHEW ROSE: Where?\nOLIVIA: Riverdale Mutual. In the Bronx. He was attempting to break in.\nMATTHEW ROSE: Well, thank you for telling me... agent.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. True or false? I take this to my lab, get them to run this skin sample, they'd tell me this was from the man who spent the past four years in Amber.\nYOUNGEST ROSE BOY: Hey Dad, Mom needs you to stick the steaks on the grill.\nMATTHEW ROSE: Okay, buddy.\nOLIVIA: Have a good day... and you can consider this investigation closed.\nPETER (in a vision): You know why you let him go, don't you? It's 'cause you can understand what he's going through. Trapped in that amber. It's just like you're trapped over here. Only difference is... nobody's going to save you. Only you can save yourself. You listened to me about the case. I don't understand why you won't listen to me about this. Why do you refuse to believe who you are? Why do you want to deny the truth about yourself?\nOLIVIA: You know, you can't prove anything that you're saying.\nPETER (in a vision): But I know things.\nOLIVIA: You're in my head.\nPETER (in a vision): Exactly. Which means you know things too. Things about the other side. Things you couldn't possibly know unless you'd been there. Unless you were from there.\nOLIVIA: Like what?\nPETER (in a vision): On the other side, the twin towers have fallen. On the other side, your sister Rachel is still alive. She lives in Chicago. Her husband took a job there. They live at 1934 Sherman Way...\nOLIVIA: See, now I know you're lying, because Rachel hates Chicago.\nPETER (in a vision): Your beautiful niece Ella is alive. She was born, and it's her birthday today. She turns seven.\nOLIVIA: There's no way to prove it.\nPETER (in a vision): Yes, there is.\nOLIVIA: Brandon. I wanna go back in the tank.\nBRANDON: You're not scheduled for another test until tomorrow.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Anything new?\nBRANDON: No. But something interesting. About twenty minutes ago, her brain chemistry spiked. It seems there's some dormant chemical in her brain.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Hmm. Some sort of synthetic compound.\nBRANDON: From the way it's bound to her neurons, I'd say it's been there since she was a child.\nELLA: Hello?\nOLIVIA: Hi.\nELLA: Aunt Liv! I knew you wouldn't forget my birthday. Aunt Liv?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What happened?\nOLIVIA: It didn't work. Nothing happened. All I saw was black."

Requesting clearance.\nMURRAY HARKINS: Tide is coming in strong. Pulling a fog bank in from the east. It's close to shore, so watch yourself and take it slow.\nDAVE BARRETT: (over ship-to-shore radio) Copy that. We see it up ahead. Looks like pea soup.\nMURRAY HARKINS: Maintain a bearing at three-five-eight. I've hung a lantern out for you. (music box tune plays)\n(in Chinatown, NY)\nDAN LIANG: Did I tell you? Mia's friend June is coming too. Seriously, one-hundred percent hot.\nSHEN CHAN: Uh-huh? (electronic beep) It's about to come on!\nDAN LIANG: Shen, are you seriously not coming?\nSHEN CHAN: Dude, when I crack this thing, They are gonna write books about me. [music box tune plays]\n(in Merrimack County, New Hampshire)\nLAIRD WOOMER: Hey, Beck. You want a tea? Love one.\nBECKY WOOMER: Hey, Aaron. You gonna make mommy a tea? (chuckles) (electronic beep) It's starting.\nLAIRD WOOMER: Okay, I'll leave you alone. (electronic beeping. female speaking in native language. music box tune plays. grunting)\nDAVE BARRETT: (over ship-to-shore radio) Captain Barrett to Fort Point Light Station. Come in. Over. (gasps) Fort Point, we're lost in the fog bank. We can't see the light. Over. Fort Point, are you there? This is \u2018\u2019Swedish Fish\u2019\u2019. Come in. Murray, it's Dave.

Who are you?\nLAIRD WOOMER: It's me, Laird. (baby Aaron cries)\nBECKY WOOMER: Who am I?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (sitting in bed and reading) Oh, wow. This is better than room service. (as breakfast is served on a lap tray) What did I do to get so lucky?\nPETER: (dutiful) Nothing. It's just for being you. (kiss on the lips)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you.\nPETER: You're welcome. So what's the latest catastrophe I want to know nothing about? (walks around, then hops into bed)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (returns to the newspaper) Well, uh, earthquakes, oil spills, financial disaster. It's not really the best way to start the day.\nPETER: Here I thought there was nothing good until the Entertainment Section.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's in the Entertainment Section?\nPETER: (provocatively) I don't know, but you should find out.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (checks the section and tickets fall out) I love U-2.\nPETER: I figured we were way overdue for a normal date.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That is just so sweet and so kind of romantic.\nPETER: Try not to sound so shocked. (another kiss)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you.\nPETER: (answers cell phone) Walter? Walter, is that you?\nWALTER: (from the lab. angered) Of course it's me. I came in this morning and found your little project.\nPETER: And what project would that be?\nWALTER: You know very well what project. You are continuing to work on this infernal device-- The one depicted in the blueprints.\nPETER: That's correct. I'm running diagnostics. (gets out of bed)\nWALTER: I thought I made my -- You have no idea what it does. You might as well be building a nuclear bomb in my lab.\nPETER: (chuckles) I don't think that's entirely fair.\nWALTER: Do you? Well, fine. If you end up breaking the universe, this time, it's on your head. (hangs-up)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What was that about?\nWALTER: It's nothing. Apparently, Walter doesn't want me playing with his toys. (gets back in bed)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers her cell phone) Dunham. (listens. there has been an incident) Yes, sir. We'll meet you there. (to Peter) Broyles.\nPETER: Guess that means we're doing the crossword in the car.\nPETER: (walking with the science team from their parked vehicles) So fifteen people all up and down the Eastern Seaboard, all suffered from retrograde amnesia at the same time?\nBROYLES: Around ten forty-five P.M.\nWALTER: Collective memory loss. That's a new one for the medical books.\nBROYLES: According to the Pentagon, the victims were all using shortwave radios.\nWALTER: Ham-radio enthusiasts -- maybe their brains were erased by the magnetic winds from the solar storm?\nPETER: If it hadn't happened four hours after sundown, you might be on to something.\nBROYLES: Becky Woomer. Her husband said he left her alone for roughly three minutes. In that time, she forgot all details about her life, including her name. The D.o.D. is concerned this could be a test run for a potential terror attack.\nLAIRD WOOMER: (in his kitchen) The doctors at the hospital don't understand it. They can't even tell me if she's going to get her memory back.\nPETER: Did your wife ever tell you what it was she was listening to?\nLAIRD WOOMER: Becky was a moderator in a chat room. They listen to number stations.\nPETER: Number stations?\nLAIRD WOOMER: I don't know much about them. They're kind of a mystery.\nWALTER: (in the victim's hobby room) Oh. A reel-to-reel. I used to have one exactly like this. I remember hours spent ripped out of my gourd listening to Beatles albums backwards for secret messages. They weren't there. (Broyles is not surprised)\nPETER: So apparently Becky recorded last night's broadcast. Whatever she heard should be on that tape.\nWALTER: Listening to what they recorded last night could cause us to forget why we wanted to listen in the first place - Einstein.\nBROYLES: Did he say what he thinks is on it?\nPETER: He said that she spends her night's listening to numbers on random ham-radio stations. She's trying to crack some code.\nBROYLES: Number stations?\nPETER: You heard of them?\nNINA: (all-knowing. candid) Number stations. Nobody knows what they are or even where they come from. As far as anyone knows, they're artificially generated voices reading streams of random numbers in a wide variety of languages. The Department of Defense hired us to investigate them. Other than the fact that they were first discovered more than seventy years ago, we came up with nothing. We could never triangulate their point of origin. This one we picked-up four years ago. (plays the original Spanish language recording) Some people think they may be covert communications between spies or drug-traffickers. The problem is no one has been able to find proof to support any theory at all. So, at the moment, they remain unexplained.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: But the number broadcasts have never caused amnesia before.\nNINA: Not to the best of our knowledge.\nWALTER: Perhaps Peter would like to play last night's tape aloud to everyone, given his recent fondness for dangerous activity. (stands brusquely) As soon as she's up to it, I would like to examine the woman who lost her mind. And I think I know a way to analyze the tape without losing our memories. Oh, I need something from the child development center. Sixth floor? (intends to leave)\nNINA: Actually, the Seventh. (to Peter as Walter exits) You might want to escort him, Peter. Yesterday, he spent fifteen minutes in front of a utility closet thinking it was the elevator.\nPETER: (amused) Right. Be right back. (leaves to follow his father)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Would you mind if Astrid took a look at your research? She might pick up something that your code breakers missed.\nNINA: Of course. (observant) Olivia, are Peter and Walter okay?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (dismissive) Yeah. (back on topic) You know we found a piece of the machine that Walternate is building. And Peter's trying to figure it out.\nNINA: He should. We need to know what we're dealing with.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Except Walter doesn't agree. He won't help. He's setting up roadblocks for Peter. (persuasive) You know, you two go back a long way. Maybe you could talk to him.\nNINA: What? You're not having any luck?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (brash) Oh, I haven't tried.\nNINA: But that's not like you. You're usually more direct with Walter?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, it's complicated between them. I don't want to make it worse. (her cell phone rings)\nNINA: (assuring) I'll speak with Walter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers cell phone) Dunham. (listens) Yes? (listens) Where?\nBROYLES: (briefing Bolivia as they approach a radio tower surrounded by law enforcement vehicles) Homeland Security traced the broadcast. When they tried to contact the tower employees, they didn't get a response.\nUNIFORMED OFFICER: As far as we can tell, the break-in happened around ten-thirty. Security system was state-of-the-art. Whoever did this was a pro... but there's something else.\n(the two agents enter the facility through an access door at ground level and walk past a dead man sitting nearby. they continue past a dead woman on the floor laying between the racks of electrical equipment. beyond her they find a large, shiny cube attached to the transmitting equipment - the device hovers in mid-air)\n(the forensics team inspects a hovering cube attached to the rack of transmitting equipment in the radio station)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How the hell is it doing that?\nBROYLES: It's not floating exactly. Apparently it's got some sort of magnetics inside. (a technician unplugs an internal connector in the device and it drops from its' hover)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So do you think that this was the source of last night's number broadcast?\nBROYLES: This is definitely wired to output a transmission. (to the technician) Hold on. I want to see that panel. I need the print powder. (sprays the large board extracted from the device and exposes a large fingerprint) It's impossible to do microelectronics with gloves on. Let's get this to Doctor Bishop. (leaves)\nASTRID: (signs for the large quantity of storage files that were just delivered) This should keep me busy for... eternity. Thank you.\nPETER: (returns from private cell phone call) Okay, that was Olivia. They're analyzing the fingerprints they found up at the radio tower, and they think they found the device used to upload last night's broadcast.\nGENE: Moo!\nWALTER: What?\nGENE: Moo!\nPETER: What's that?\nGENE: Moo!\nASTRID: (looks at child's audio toy) Property of Massive Dynamic?\nWALTER: It's not theft if you own the company. I've found a way to listen to the tape of the numbers broadcast without losing what faculties I have left.\nPETER: Well, how'd you manage that?\nWALTER: The key is analog demodulation. I knew my Jimi Hendrix wah-wah pedal would come in handy. Take a look. This is the sound of the transmission, modified so it's safe, of course. But if we demodulate... (electronic tone pitches down and the waveform on the monitor divides to two separate waves)\nPETER: So there are two signals?\nWALTER: Precisely. The top wave is 'the numbers. The bottom wave, which I have suppressed is a pulse. And I believe that this is responsible for the amnesia. Someone found a way to attach this pulse to the numbers broadcast.\nASTRID: Well, that explains why nobody's been affected by listening to the number stations before, because they're not causing the problem.\nWALTER: So we still don't know where the numbers are coming from, but I suspect that the device that Agent Dunham found is the source of the pulse.\nASTRID: Okay, but who would do this, and why give these people amnesia?\nPETER: Because they cracked the code, or they came damn close to figuring out what number stations are... and somebody wants to keep that a secret.\nWALTER: Well done. You sounded very Sherlock Holmes just then. (to Astrid) Which makes you Watson, Dear.\nPETER: Walter... is this the soundboard I was using to run diagnostics on the weapon? (growing upset)\nWALTER: I was using it to down-convert the signal.\nPETER: Really? (holds-up unplugged electrical prongs)\nWALTER: (defensive) I was focused on solving the case at hand. I'm not concerned with preserving your wretched experiment. Now, if you don't mind, I have some thinking to do. (walks off)\nPETER: (softly to Astrid) This has got to stop. (joins his father in a quiet office) Walter...\nWALTER: (miffed) I asked you not to work on that device in my lab!\nPETER: They're working on it on the other side. We need to understand exactly what it does.\nWALTER: What's to understand? You're playing with fire. Stop being so bull-headed and put a stop to this.\nPETER: Walter (sits)... when I touched that device on the other side... it came alive in my hands... like it was bonded directly to me. How can you expect me to ignore that?\nASTRID: (joins the somber duo) I just talked to Olivia. They pulled a picture of our suspect from his prints. She's taking it to the Woomer house now to show it to the husband. Becky was released from the hospital. She's back home now.\nWALTER: Oh.\n(in the dark woods near a large radio tower, a man carries another cubed device toward the facility)\n(sitting in the kitchen with the victim's husband. studying a photo of the man suspected of planting the device in the radio tower)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: His name is Joseph Feller. Earlier today, we picked up his prints from a radio tower just outside Boston. His last known address was Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That was 1997. But since then, he's been off the map.\nLAIRD WOOMER: (studies the image) I've never seen him before in my life.\nPETER: Do you mind if we poke around a little bit? There's some things here that could be useful to us. Maybe check out her computer, her address book?\nLAIRD WOOMER: Of course.\n(the man in the woods, Joseph Feller, works quickly in a second radio facility to install another cubed device)\nWALTER: (sitting with the victim and running some tests) Read this and then do what it says.\nBECKY WOOMER: Stand up, then sit down.\nWALTER: Wonderful. Thank you. Earlier, I told you the names of three things.\nBECKY WOOMER: Cat, horse, cotton candy.\nWALTER: Very good. (watches as she picks-up an unfinished knitting project) It's beautiful.\nBECKY WOOMER: I don't remember doing this. I suppose I was knitting it for the baby. (teary) I don't recognize him. (intimidated) I don't recognize that man who is out there. I look at the pictures everywhere and I see myself in them. But I - I don't know them.\nWALTER: (reassuring) The human brain is a miracle... a most resilient organ... a storage unit for everything you have ever known... seen, or felt. It's all still in there, whether or not you are conscious of that.\nPETER: (privately, after searching the victim's hobby room) This is a list of everybody that Becky talked to about the number stations. You recognize anyone?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (flatly reads what he was pointing to) Ed Markham?\nPETER: Bookstore owner? Purveyor of rare manuscripts? Your favorite ladies' man?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, right. (laughs) How could I forget? (clueless)\nPETER: I'm gonna give him a call, see if maybe he has some idea about this.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (after Peter moves off) Walter, are you alright?\nWALTER: (reflective) I know what it's like, what this woman's going through. I lived it. To not recognize your life... it's awful.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (sincere) I'm sorry, Walter.\nWALTER: Don't be. (pained smile) Let's just focus on putting a stop to this before more people get hurt.\n(Feller completes his work in the radio station by inserting an additional circuit\/chip on a main panel. he activates the device he installed and the cube hovers in-place)\nPILOT: (a dark and stormy night, thunder rumbles as the small commuter plane struggles at altitude in the violent flight conditions. radio call) Baltimore Center, this is Landau Two-Eight-Seven. Request to divert to Richmond. Over.\nBALTIMORE CENTER (on radio): Roger, Landau Two-Eight-Seven. Weather is... (radio static) Level Five thunderstorm... (radio static) You'll have... (radio static)\nPILOT: Baltimore Center, say again. You're breaking up. (severe turbulence rattles the passengers. tuning to another channel gets music and a recitation of numbers. the pilot reacts to the broadcast, grabs his head and yells from the overload)\nTV NEWSCAST: The small twin engine plane went down just outside of Owings Mills, Maryland.\nASTRID: (turns from TV) NTSB just released a statement. It looks like the plane's radio was tuned into the same frequency as the second numbers broadcast.\nWALTER: (fiddling with the pulse device) Precisely what I was worried about. A second attack, and now not only do we have twenty new amnesiacs, but six people died. (frustrated with the device) Damn it! Why can't I get a current?\nASTRID: Maybe you reversed the poles?\nWALTER: No. It just doesn't make sense. Everything that I know about the physics of electricity says that this device shouldn't work at all.\nASTRID: Walter, I know that you're angry right now, and I get it. I cannot make heads or tails of this code. It's immense. It's not even just one code. The... the numbers are a code. The time between the numbers is a code. (answers her cell phone. listens) Yes, sir? Okay, I will make sure that he gets it. (hangs-up) That was Agent Broyles. There was another radio tower break-in. It was unmanned, so nobody was hurt, but they found another cube... the one that must have downed the aircraft. They're sending it over right now.\nWALTER: Wonderful. Another cube I can't make any sense of.\nASTRID: Well... maybe this will do us some good? (shows him a classical music album) Hmm. (soothed. they smile at one another) Alright, let's get back to work. (claps hands)\nEDWARD MARKHAM: (sitting and sorting books) Number stations? It was a hobby. I banged my head on that wall for five years and gave up. Stamp collecting... now there's a hobby with dividends.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, all the people who listened to the last two number broadcasts have had their memories wiped. We're trying to identify who's behind it.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Are you serious? (stands-up)\nPETER: Whatever they knew and whatever they figured out about the numbers, somebody made sure that they forgot it. So whatever you know about what they mean would really help us.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: (sighs) Okay... I'll help you, but you have to promise me I'll be safe.\nPETER: Sure. Done. Just tell us what you know about the stations.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: (in a separate part of the store) First of all, they're as old as dirt. They say when Marconi invented the radio, the first thing he heard was the numbers, like they were floating around in space just waiting for someone to listen.\nPETER: So you're trying to tell me that Marconi picked up a transmission before humans invented the technology to send one?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Creepy, right? (opens a metal lock box, removes a book and displays it)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Wow. The First People.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: By Seamus Wiles, 1897. There was only one edition. You're holding one of the last copies.\nPETER: And this will tell us what the numbers mean?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: No, but it'll tell you where they came from, or one theory at least.\nPETER: By \"First People,\" what are we talking about... Adam and Eve?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: No, before dinosaurs, before all of it, there were the first people... the first humans to evolve on this planet.\nPETER: If you don't know anything, you can just say that.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: I'm serious. Look, just read the book. It's all in there.\nPETER: How much do you want for it?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: I don't want your money. I want protection. What if someone comes to erase my memories?\nPETER: (chuckles) I should be so lucky.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thanks, Markham. (turns and leaves with Peter)\nWALTER: (begins to inspect the second pulse device that just arrived) Fantastic. Now I have bookends.\nNINA: (unexpected entrance) Definitely a conversation piece.\nWALTER: Nina... if I had known you were coming, I'd have baked a cake.\nASTRID: He means that... literally.\nNINA: Next time I'll call. Hello, Astrid. (turns) Walter, I need to speak with you.\nNINA: (sitting on a bench in the wooded commons watching students walk around. Walter lights up) I forgot how serious this campus has become. I remember my time here quite differently.\nWALTER: (exhales smoke) We did have fun, didn't we? (inhales again) Don't know what happened to this generation. I have a prescription.\nNINA: (takes a hit of Walter's \"medical\" cannabis) So do I.\nWALTER: Look at all these students. When did they become so afraid? We had the courage to think against the grain of what we were told. We let our curiosity be our guide.\nNINA: (candidly) So why stop Peter from following his?\nWALTER: (hesitates) What Peter's doing is different. He's bent on pursuing something despite the grave risks it poses to his well-being.\nNINA: You can't create a vaccine without working with the virus.\nWALTER: No, but I have experienced what this kind of hubris can do.\nNINA: Well, and yet you didn't heed anyone's warnings. I begged you to stop, but you insisted on finding a way to cross over. Peter wouldn't be here now if you hadn't.\nWALTER: If he continues to investigate--\nNINA: Yes, well, he will continue to investigate - whether you like it or not.\nWALTER: Then he will play right into Walternate's hands. I--\nNINA: What do you mean?\nWALTER: (passionately) If only one world can survive, then it stands to reason that Walternate will use Peter to ensure that it's his world that does. But he has already built as much of the machine as he can. He gave the blueprints to Peter and asked him to complete it... even though... this... could kill him. (hands her the drawing of Peter activating the weapon)\nNINA: I remember, Walter, but who says this is the only outcome? It's a drawing, not destiny. Even if you're right about Walternate's plan, I mean, you don't know if he'll succeed. And given the stakes, won't Peter need your guidance more than ever? (earnest) Walter... one of the things I have most admired about you is your optimism. Don't become a fatalist now.\nPETER: (sits and reads as Bolivia speeds) So according to this... something happened, some sort of cataclysm that so completely decimated the first people, they were just wiped out of the historical record.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So how did Seamus Wiles know about them?\nPETER: Yeah, exactly. They were apparently very technologically advanced. They discovered the vacuum.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, the vacuum cleaner?\nPETER: (chuckles) no. The Vacuum as in \"the source of all creation and destruction.\"\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Interesting.\nPETER: This book is useless. There's nothing here. (turns page) What were the numbers on the first broadcast?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Why?\nPETER: Well, if you were to believe the book, the First People measured time in months that had wildly different numbers of days in them. But humor me. What were the numbers?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (uncertainty, slowly recalls) uh... 12... 34, 17... 9, 15, and, uh...\nPETER\/BOLIVIA DUNHAM (simultaneously): 8, 42, 40.\nPETER: Yeah. The numbers of the first broadcast correspond exactly with the numbers in this book. They match the numbers of this calendar exactly. Never thought I'd say this, but I think Markham's right. Somehow the number stations are connected to these First People. What the hell does that mean?\nWALTER: (walking with Astrid through his Harvard lab) It's fascinating. Remarkable. Read more.\nASTRID: You don't actually believe this? An ancient people who evolved before the dinosaurs just vanished without a trace? (stares at the content in the book Peter retrieved from Markham) It's -- it's absurd.\nWALTER: (after stopping at Peter's workstation) Why should we be so arrogant as to assume that we're the first Homo sapiens to walk the Earth. History is full of extinction events... climate change, meteorites, Atlantis.\nASTRID: Atlantis? Peter, come on. Help me out here.\nPETER: I don't know what I believe yet. All I know is that the numbers in their calendar correspond with the numbers of the first broadcast. That can't just be a coincidence.\nASTRID: (reading from the book) They were a people of great technological prowess who made the ultimate discovery. A mechanism known to them as The Vacuum, containing at once both the power to Create, and to Destroy.\nWALTER: (chuckling) The Vacuum. What a wonderful name, and it verifies some of my theories.\nASTRID: What theories, Walter? Create and destroy what?\nWALTER: Well, everything. (excitedly) Many religions speak of such a power. And science, the Big Bang, And it's counterpart, the Big Crunch. The universe expanding and contracting And expanding... an endless cycle of creation and destruction.\nPETER: Okay, let's run with that. Let's say that these First People did create this mechanism and then somehow translated into a code.\nASTRID: And now someone is wiping people's memories to keep the code a secret?\nWALTER: It's not so surprising. It's the key to the universe. It's a secret worth protecting.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (walks into the lab from the access hall) Hey. Sorry I'm late, but I thought these might cheer you up. (hands Walter a pastry box)\nWALTER: (opens the box) Oh. Oh. Oh! Malassadas! Oh, it's wonderful. (happily starts to devour one of the donut-y treats)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Anything new in the book?\nASTRID: I'm sure the numbers hold the answers, But beyond that, nothing tangible.\nPETER: (inspecting the pulse weapon taken from the broadcast tower) Wait a minute. Hey, Walter? Come here. Take a look at this. This transistor is newer than the rest of them. Somebody must have replaced it. It's Polish, and it's military grade. (*holds up the transistor with tweezers, then drops it in an envelope) There's only a couple of places that are licensed to sell parts like that, and they're all regulated, which means that you have to give a verified address to buy one. (stands and walks to this office) I'm gonna make some phone calls.\nWALTER: May I borrow that? (reaches for the book)\nASTRID: Mm-hmm.\nWALTER: I feel a bowel movement coming on.\nASTRID: (somewhat disgusted) Walter.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Can you tell Peter I'll be back? I'm gonna let Broyles know where we're at.\nASTRID: Mm-hmm.\n(Bolivia drives away quickly in her car)\nWALTER: (later, Walter joins Astrid as she sits and studies) Avocado, cucumber, and cheese. (places a plate of food before her) In 1974, the C.I.A. asked me to develop the best sandwich for clarity of thought.\nASTRID: (focuses on the paperwork covering her desk) There's too much information here.\nWALTER: But of course the chips are just because I like foods that crunch.\nASTRID: (sighs and starts to eat what Walter has brought her) There has to be a pattern here. Every code relies on a pattern. I just need to see it.\nWALTER: But you can't. That's your problem.\nASTRID: Thanks for the vote of confidence.\nWALTER: Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, I... I simply meant that to break the code you would have to think like they did, and they lived millions and millions of years ago. I... I mean, for one thing, look at their concept of time. Nine days in a month? (side-tracked) If you're not going to eat those chips, May I? (as Astrid's jaw drops in a moment of clarity) What? What? What happened?\nASTRID: Here. Read me this calendar. (hands him the old book) How many days are in each month?\nWALTER: Why?\nASTRID: Humor me.\nWALTER: The first two are twelve and thirty-four. Then seventeen, nine, fifteen. What are you thinking, Watson?\nASTRID: That maybe what we're missing is a Cipher Matrix... our decoder ring. Okay, what are the next months?\nWALTER: Eight, forty-two, forty, twenty-seven...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (knocks on the door of her shapeshifting accomplice in his high-rise apartment building. when the door opens) We've got a problem. (walks in)\nJOSEPH FELLER: (closes the door and follows) The Secretary said we weren't supposed to meet.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, the Secretary is on the other side. He can't foresee every turn of events. Now, you replaced a transistor in one of the boxes. Polish -- they found it. They're tracking the sale as we speak.\nJOSEPH FELLER: Who are these people?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Look, you were sloppy. You've jeopardized the mission.\nJOSEPH FELLER: I'm supposed to upload another pulse tomorrow.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I think you've done enough. We've got their attention. There's no need to hurt any more innocent people.\nJOSEPH FELLER: What do they say on this side? (cell phone rings) \"All's fair in love and war\"? If they were in our shoes, they would do exactly what we're doing.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: We've got an address on the suspect. Joseph Feller. 989 Nelson Street, Medford. We're en route with backup.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, I'm on my way. (to Feller) They're coming.\nJOSEPH FELLER: Where should I go? Do you have any information on my next mission?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, I do. (tires screeching)\nPETER: Olivia's already here. (gunshot and glass shatters) (thud) (overlapping chatter)\nBROYLES: It's a shape-shifter. (elevator bell dings)\nPETER: Olivia... Thank god you're alright. Tell me what happened.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: He--he came at me. I had no choice.\nPETER: But you're alright?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, I'm alright. But, uh, he was coming out as I got here, and...\nPETER: But you're alright?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh-huh. ( radio chatter )\nWALTER: Any breakthroughs? (standing next to his colleague as they study the multiple cipher matrices she has created on the many clear plexiglass boards around the lab)\nASTRID: (scanning for possible patterns) I don't know. I thought that maybe if I added up all the numbers...\nWALTER: ..well, keep at it. And I wouldn't go in the bathroom, Dear. (walks away)\nASTRID: (starts to erase part of a matrix and marvels at the sunshine passing through the drawing board - and onto the circular globe of Earth nearby) Huh.\n(racing to the disabled shapeshifter before the technician can zip closed the body bag)\nPETER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on! I need to look at that body. You got a pair of gloves on you?\nBROYLES: What is it?\nPETER: Well, it makes sense now why Walter couldn't figure out the tech that emitted the amnesia pulse. It must have come from the other side.\nBROYLES: Which suggests Walternate knows what the numbers mean. He must be the one protecting the code.\n(Peter flips the shapeshifter on to its' side to search the lower spine area)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What? (as Peter feels around inside the machine)\nPETER: Data storage unit. (pulls out the badly mangled component and holds it up) I'm guessing we're not gonna get anything off of that. It's toast.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers ringing cell phone) Dunham.\nASTRID: (calling from Walter's lab) I think I cracked the code. I know what Number Stations are.\nASTRID: (standing before her work on the clear plexiglass drawing boards) It's a coordinate system. These numbers indicate locations. Latitude and longitude. 35 degrees and 40 minutes South by 58 degrees and 40 minutes West, that's just outside Buenos Aires, Argentina. All of these numbers indicate specific locations on a globe... Ethiopia, Spain, China.\nPETER: So what's there at the end of the points?\nASTRID: So far as I can tell, nothing special... a farmhouse, public swimming pool, and random stuff like that.\nWALTER: We're not looking for a man-made structure. If this message is millions of years old, then we're likely talking about something buried beneath the earth.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How many locations?\nASTRID: I haven't finished plugging in all the numbers, But so far, twenty-two.\nPETER: And what's the closest one?\nPETER: (walks across the very active excavation site with two beverages and finds Bolivia) What'd I miss?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, uh, thank you, (takes her drink) Nothing yet. They just pulled up an old buried football, so...\nPETER: I had to go back. Forgot to say skim.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (chuckles) You walked there twice? You didn't have to do that.\nPETER: Well, I had a motive. (charmingly) It's the little things that make me irresistible.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What if he's right? (looks at the doctor standing by himself, nearby) Walter?\nPETER: Right about what?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I've been thinking, Peter. Your father's concerned about building Walternate's device. What if it does mean the destruction of one universe or... or the other?\nPETER: (heavy with concern) We don't know that yet.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (trying to sound upbeat) That's not really my point. If you knew that only... one of our worlds could survive and if it was up to you, and you alone, to defend your side... You'd have no choice, right? I mean, you would have to do what you had to do... no matter the cost to protect... our world.\nPETER: (earnestly) There are billions of innocent people over there... just like here... people with jobs, families, lives. I got to believe there's another way. And whatever my part in all of this is... I got to believe there's another way. There's always hope, right? (sips his drink, then runs to the dig site when he hears)\nEXCAVATOR: We got something!\n(Walter and Bolivia join Peter at the deep hole as a large, heavy cylindrical-shaped object is hoisted from the deep pit. In the lab, Astrid continues her deciphering and assignment of values to position on the map)\nASTRID: Oh, my. (softly to herself)\n(Peter clears packed dirt from the surface of the object and finds large carved glyphs)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nASTRID: (calling from the lab) I just identified the last coordinates... Milton, Massachusetts, the house where the first piece of Walternate's machine was buried. Do you think it's possible that these locations are all a part of the machine, that Walternate's device is the vacuum described in The First People book?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, yes. I think they're one and the same. (ends call, then to Peter and Walter) Astrid finished the code. There are thirty-seven more locations.\nWALTER: (resolutely) In that case... it seems we have work to do. We have to recover the pieces, assemble it, and figure out how it works. (looks Peter in the face to assure that this is the course he wants to pursue) Creation and Destruction... I suppose we'll have to hope for the former.\n(after the visit to Jersey City, Bolivia returns to the vintage office equipment shop and her communication device. She rolls paper into the typewriter and reports that \"THEY'VE LOCATED THE PIECES OF THE DEVICE.\" After a few seconds she receives a reply - WELL DONE. INITIATE PHASE TWO)\n(in the alternate universe, Olivia exits the shower into her steamy bathroom and places her earpiece in her ear to take a call)\nOLIVIA: Dunham.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (calling from his lab on Liberty Island) Agent Dunham, this is Brandon Fayette.\nOLIVIA: Oh, Brandon. Hey. Uh, I'm on my way. I should be about an hour.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Actually, that's why I'm calling. The Secretary has decided to postpone today's procedure.\nOLIVIA: So when do you want me to come in?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: It may not be necessary. We'll let you know.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Bye.\nPETER (as a vision): You have to get out of here. You know why they canceled the last test, don't you? Whatever they needed from you, they have it now. It's not safe for you here anymore, Olivia. (emphatic) You have to go home."

Through sorrow comes exaltation. Through pitch dark comes a cleansing fire. Through the fire, we shall find a spring of new life.\nMAX CLAYTON: (alone and scared in his bed, he rousts mom from her bed) Mommy?\nEMILY CLAYTON: Max?\nMAX CLAYTON: There's a monster in my closet.\nEMILY CLAYTON: (walks him back to bed and looks around the room) No monsters here. None there either. Looks like your room is officially monster-free tonight, kiddo. Now, you remember what big boys do to get rid of monsters in their room?\nMAX CLAYTON: Well, you close your eyes, and you count to three.\nEMILY CLAYTON: And when we open them?\nMAX CLAYTON: The monster's gone.\nEMILY CLAYTON: Mm-hmm. You get some rest, Sweetie. (kisses her son on the forehead. turns off the light and starts to leave) I love you.\nMAX CLAYTON: (sits and listens to the sounds of his room. his door swings shut and a masked man steps from behind it. he covers his eyes) One, two, three. (uncovers his eyes and is immediately gagged by the masked man)\n(Max loses consciousness and is carried to the second-storey window. his abductor opens the window and jumps to the ground below with the boy)\n(cabbie Henry Higgins sits near the West Village docks listening to the radio, reading and waiting for his next fare)\nRADIO BROADCAST: ...polls show that most Americans oppose the proposed law to limit the number of children to two per family... however, leading politicians from two of the three major parties favor the law...\nOLIVIA: (hopping into the back seat of the cab) Hey.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You. (startled at the return of one of his most challenging customers) W-what are you doing here?\nOLIVIA: (all smiles) Can I buy you breakfast?\n(sitting in a booth next to the window)\nOLIVIA: (to the server when their meals arrive) Thank you.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Thanks.\nOLIVIA: (in a hushed tone to her breakfast guest) I need to get into the DoD facility on Liberty Island, and I need your help. I can steal a boat, but I can't leave it docked on the island, otherwise the security patrol would find it, and I need some time inside the building alone. I just need you to get me across the water.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Across the patrolled water. You're with Fringe Division. Don't you have super-secret clearance or something? Why you breaking into a government building?\nOLIVIA: Because I have to go home.\nHENRY HIGGINS: (semi-sarcastic) Oh, so home is on Liberty Island now.\nOLIVIA: It doesn't matter where I'm from. What matters -- what matters is that I'm in trouble, and I think that my time is running out here, and right now you are the only person that I'm willing to trust. I need your help, Henry. Please, will you help me?\nHENRY HIGGINS: (rubs his eyes) So if all you're asking for is a ride... you ain't got to steal a boat. My cousin has one. Just give me a day or so.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: (reads new text mail - 400 Terry Ave. New Yonkers) Okay, there's my number. (hands him a small piece of paper) I gotta go.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Hey. Those people you're running away from, they still after you?\nOLIVIA: Not if they keep believing that I'm somebody else, no. (starts to leave) Thanks.\nAGENT FRANCIS: We'll let you know if Fringe Division officially assumes the case. Thanks. (shakes hands with departing officer) Appreciate it.\nOLIVIA: (approaches) So what do we have?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Kid was abducted from his bedroom last night.\nLINCOLN LEE: (joins his team with readings) Okay, we're good down here. Molecular cohesion intact. Atmosphere readings are solid.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You know, these kidnappings are tragic, but ninety-nine percent of them have nothing to do with Fringe Division.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah, tell that to the Secretary. The Peter Bishop Act of '91 says every kidnapping gets treated like a possible Fringe event.\nAGENT FRANCIS: All I'm saying is that these cops don't need us to work their cases, okay? Waste of manpower. (Emily Clayton sits nearby and sobs)\nOLIVIA: It's not a waste.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I'll get a statement.\nOLIVIA: (to Lincoln) Let's check upstairs. (enters the boy's room) Detective? Would you mind walking us through the scene?\nDETECTIVE: Sure. Uh, victim is Max Clayton. Eight years old. Mom came in to check on him in the morning, and he was gone. We, uh--we found a couple of partial prints on the windowsill and in the closet, but we're still collecting evidence. We believe the suspect snatched the kid, and he, uh, fled out the window.\nOLIVIA: Well, it's a long way down, especially if you're carrying a fifty-pound kid. Okay, so the suspect is probably male, strong, uh, say twenty to thirty-five.\nLINCOLN LEE: (to the forensics technician) Hey, can I see that for a second? (studies the print. to Olivia) There's some kind of residue on these fingerprints. (analyzes the print with his handheld scanner) Sucrose.\nDETECTIVE: Sugar? What, was he eating cookies or something?\nLINCOLN LEE: Uh-uh. He secretes it through his sweat. The Candy Man... he's back.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (as his boss joins him in his office) Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (close the door behind him) I just heard. Fringe Division was created to investigate tragedies of unimaginable scale. You and I both know that there's no crime more heinous than the theft of a child.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'll do everything I can to find him, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I don't doubt your resolve, Philip. Actually, that's why I'm here. There's no shame in letting it fall to another desk if it's too personal.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (solemn) It's been four years since the Candy Man took my son. Four years... since I heard him laugh or watched him play outside with his sister. He had my son for two days. When I got him back, he wasn't a little boy anymore. If there's anyone you want on this case... it's me.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Very well.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: My only concern is that I don't have all of my agents to help me. How long until this is over, sir - until our Olivia comes home?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You'll be happy to know we made a breakthrough. We found something in her brain chemistry, something unique. If it's what enables her to cross between worlds, you'll have your team back very soon. I know what it's like to lose a son. And even when they come back, the damage is irreparable. If you need someone to talk to, Philip, let me know. (leaves the office)\nAGENT FRANCIS: (barking motivation to agents in the Situation Room) We need a lead, folks. Something to go on. It's been eighteen hours since the Clayton boy went missing. That gives us until tomorrow night to find him.\nLINCOLN LEE: The Candy Man's last kidnapping was two years ago, before you joined Fringe Division.\nOLIVIA: I remember when this happened, reading about it, but the papers never said what he did to these kids. It's like they've had the life drained out of them.\nLINCOLN LEE: Acute deterioration of organ tissue, depleted immune systems. Some of the kids even came back with cancer.\nOLIVIA: (points to close-up case file image) Those incisions -- why there?\nLINCOLN LEE: Posterior cerebral cortex. From that point on the body, you can access the spine.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Astrid, what do we know about these cases?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: The abductions themselves appear to be random, occurring every two years. The victims are always children ages seven through nine. They are taken, then released forty-eight hours later with massive internal degradation. The victims describe the suspect as male, age unknown. In the majority of cases, other than a shaved head, there's no physical description given, because he wore a mask.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean in the majority of cases?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Two of the victims reported being held captive by two suspects, one young and one old.\nOLIVIA: Then why haven't we expanded the profile to look for two suspects?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Liv, these kids were really scared. There's a lot of inconsistencies in their statements.\nOLIVIA: Well, that doesn't mean that they're not true. (to Farnsworth) Can you please pull up the victim's bios? (studies the bios) Okay, Amanda Holt and Christopher... Broyles. We should speak to Christopher again.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's not a good idea, Liv. You weren't here when it happened. Broyles is protective.\nOLIVIA: Well, we should at least ask.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Liv... don't even think about it.\nOLIVIA: (standing in her bosses office) I would like to re-interview your son.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Excuse me?\nOLIVIA: Christopher reported that he was held by two men-- an older man and a younger man. Now, if that's true, he may remember other things about this guy that could help our investigation.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Agent Dunham... my son went through something no child should ever have to go through. And when he came home, I had to ask him questions about it, going over the details again and again, forcing him to relive it, when all he wanted to do was forget. And for what? I didn't solve the case. And I didn't help my little boy sleep at night.\nOLIVIA: I'm sure that you did your best, but if I spoke to him, maybe I could get more out of him.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'm his father.\nOLIVIA: Perhaps that's the problem. Maybe there are some things that you don't want to hear.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (stands and gets in her face) Now, there's something I want you to hear. My son's condition since he was taken has deteriorated so rapidly that he'll be lucky if he makes it to his eighteenth birthday. Now, what little childhood Christopher has left, I intend to protect it.\nOLIVIA: I get that. But Christopher's childhood is not the only one at stake right now.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (sternly) You're dismissed.\nMAX CLAYTON: (to his masked abductor when he is offered a candy treat) I don't feel good. I want to go home.\nWYATT TOOMY: (chants) Through suffering comes redemption. Through sorrow comes exaltation. Through the pitch dark comes the cleansing fire, and through the fire, we shall find the spring of new life.\n(a large metal device is attached to the back of Max' neck)\n(in Glen Cove, Chris Broyles sits in the family room and listens to a classic pulp fiction radio tale. his father joins his mother in the kitchen)\nRADIO NARRATOR: ...devotes his life to righting wrongs, protecting the innocent, and punishing the guilty. Cranston is known to the underworld as The Shadow. Never seen, only heard, his true identity is known only to his constant friend and aide, Margo Lane. Today's story...\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Hey.\nDIANE BROYLES: (looks up from the newscast on the television) Hey. (they exchange kisses) There's been a police officer parked out front all afternoon. So it's true? (concerned) The Candy Man's back?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Yeah.\nDIANE BROYLES: Ahem. Do you think he'll try to come back here?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: No. (sincerely) It is just for my peace of mind. How's Christopher?\nDIANE BROYLES: He's scared. The story about the missing boy's been all over the news today. Did you eat?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Not since breakfast.\nDIANE BROYLES: (opens the refrigerator and retrieves some food) Has there been any progress in the case?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: No. One of my agents wanted to re-interview Chris -- Olivia Dunham. She thinks there may be some detail he's forgotten. I told her it was a waste of time.\nDIANE BROYLES: (hands him the plate of food) I've always liked Olivia. She seems very smart.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (sips from his bottle of beer) I'm gonna go put him to bed.\nDIANE BROYLES: He's a strong boy, Philip... strong enough to talk about it... even if you're not.\nLINCOLN LEE: (joining his team mate with a snack as she studies and thinks) Thought you might be hungry too.\nOLIVIA: Red Vines?\nLINCOLN LEE: They're new. Charlie tried them and said they're great.\nOLIVIA: Thanks. So after the victims were abducted, the kids came back with massive cell degeneration and internal-organ atrophy. All those conditions are symptomatic of old age too, right?\nLINCOLN LEE: I suppose so. Why?\nOLIVIA: Well, aging has to do with the pituitary gland, right? Which can be accessed through the back of the neck.\nLINCOLN LEE: Did you suddenly become a scientist when I was in the hospital? You trying to take my job?\nOLIVIA: It was an old case that I worked before I joined Fringe Division. This guy was draining hormones from pituitary glands. Anyway, my point is that some of the victims mentioned there were two suspects, one old and one young, but they all said that they never saw the suspects at the same time.\nLINCOLN LEE: (contemplates) Okay.\nOLIVIA: Well, what if there weren't two people? What if there was only one person who was literally changing from old to young? What if the Candy Man is stealing youth?\nLINCOLN LEE: Okay. (thinks) In theory, concentrated pituitary hormones could be processed in some way to accelerate healing, maybe even reverse aging, but - if that's true, it would also cause some serious side effects.\nOLIVIA: Like what?\nLINCOLN LEE: Anemia, tremors, hypoglycemia.\nOLIVIA: High blood sugar? High enough that he could secrete sugar in his sweat? (answers a call on her earpiece) This is Dunham. (listens. nods) Okay, I'll be there. Thank you.\nLINCOLN LEE: What was that about?\nDIANE BROYLES: (walks with Olivia from the front door) It's nice to see you again, Olivia. Chris is looking forward to meeting you. Here we are.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Chris, Agent Dunham's here.\nOLIVIA: Oh, uh, \"Olivia\" is fine. It's, uh--it's nice to meet you, Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (turns from his keyboard to greet his guest) Hi. (offers to shake hands)\nOLIVIA: (finds and shakes the hand of the visually-impaired young man) Hi.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (as she sits across from a young fan) Did you really save that school bus of kids from a Class-Three Vortex last year? Is it true?\nOLIVIA: (humbly) Well, I was just doing my job.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: Oh. that's so cool. So... my mom says you want to talk about the man who took me.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Would that be okay?\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (hesitates. sighs. nods) Sure.\nOLIVIA: Maybe we could talk somewhere else. Like, where is your favorite place to go?\n(Olivia and Chris walk along the shoreline. the youngster hangs onto her arm with one hand and clears his path with white cane in the other hand. his father lingers near the car and watches as the two find a place to sit and talk)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (answers a call in his earpiece) Broyles.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (calling from the DoD lab) The Candy Man has had the boy for thirty-six hours. Twelve hours left. How are we doing?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Nothing yet, but we're working every lead we have.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You'll be happy to hear that you'll have your team back together soon. Our Olivia's mission on the other side is almost complete, and we'll be able to bring her home.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: And what about this Olivia?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: We're going to pull her out of the field tomorrow morning. I don't believe we'll be needing her anymore. Call me if you find anything.\n(they terminate the call and the Colonel turns to watch his son from afar)\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: My dad says I need to forget about what happened.\nOLIVIA: Yeah? But it's hard to forget, isn't it? You know, I can imagine what it must have been like for you... how scared you must have been, how much you -- you really wanted to get back to your family, and to your friends.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: I - I have nightmares about this sometimes.\nOLIVIA: Really? Could you tell me about them?\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: I always remember the smell first. It's musty, like our attic. He comes to the room wearing a mask to check on that thing stuck in my neck. It feels like... it's stealing my energy. I'm so tired. I feel sick.\nOLIVIA: Chris, you said that there were two men... one old and one young, right? Did they ever talk to you?\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: No. Nothing I remember.\nOLIVIA: Chris... What is it? You can tell me.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: I know the Candy Man's back.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, he is.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (starts to get teary-eyed) He said if I told anyone about him, he -- he'd come back. He said this time... he'd -- he'd hurt my mom and dad. (weeps)\nOLIVIA: That is not going to happen. (puts her arm around him and comforts him) I promise. Christopher, there is another little boy just like you. He's been taken, and he wants to go home and see his family too. You can help him.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (with resolve) I remember their voices. Um, they both said the same thing. I think it was a prayer.\nOLIVIA: Can you remember the words?\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: Some of the words. \"Through the pitch dark... comes a cleansing fire.\"\nOLIVIA: Okay.\n(with eleven hours and nine minutes remaining to recover Max Clayton)\nAGENT FRANCIS: (joins Lee in the Situation Room carrying, and reading from, an electronic tablet) ...\"through the pitch dark comes a cleansing fire.\" The words \"pitch\" and \"dark\" are common to several sacramental prayers from the early Twentieth Century. Uh, the words appear in the liturgy of over a dozen churches in New York City.\nLINCOLN LEE: A dozen that we know of. Every time there's another Fringe event, a new church pops up. You know, I thought it was bad enough someone's kidnapping kids. Now we find out he's kidnapping kids for God?\n(the Colonel returns with his son and agent, parks in the driveway and holds the door for a happy Christopher)\nDIANE BROYLES: (steps out of the house) Hi, Honey.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (upbeat and excited) Mom, I collected some shells for you. They smell like the ocean. (hands the shells over)\nDIANE BROYLES: Thank you. Oh, looks like you brought half the beach back with you too. (starts to wipe her messy child)\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (smiling) No, leave the sand. I like it.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'll be right in. (answers a call on his earpiece) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: He was very, very helpful. Thank you.\nDIANE BROYLES: Thank you. (returns to the house with her rejuvenated son)\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (to his mom) Come on. I want to wash the shells off.\nDIANE BROYLES: Okay.\nOLIVIA: Bye, Christopher.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: Bye.\nOLIVIA: (answers he cell phone) Dunham.\nHENRY HIGGINS: (over the phone) The boat's called Sally. The Red Hook Marina in Brooklyn -- \"B\" Dock. Be there tonight at 10:00, and I'll get you where you want to go.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'll be there. (hangs-up quickly)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham. Charlie got a hit on the prayer. They traced it to the Astoria Church in Queens.\nOLIVIA: ...\"through the pitch dark comes the cleansing fire.\"\nREVEREND MARCUS: Yeah. \"and through the fire, you shall find the spring of new life.\" It's beautiful, isn't it?\nOLIVIA: What does it mean?\nREVEREND MARCUS: I wasn't always a man of the cloth. You know, I used to be a physician. And then the Avian Influenza Epidemic came. My wife became ill. And despite all my training, there was... there was nothing I could do to save her. Without her... I was nothing. I was lost. But then God came and lifted me up, and -- and he showed me that what people need in these troubled times is -- is something to believe in. Faith -- that's what'll heal this wounded world.\nOLIVIA: The prayer was spoken by the suspect in a kidnapping that we're investigating. We believe the suspect is a member of your church. It will help our investigation if you would give us the names and addresses of all the men in your congregation.\nREVEREND MARCUS: Giving out information on parishioners is -- is breaking the confessional seal.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Reverend Marcus, I understand. I too am a man of faith. But right now there's a child missing, and we need your help. We have a former victim who can identify the kidnappers' voices.\nREVEREND MARCUS: And you believe that this person is reliable?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: He's my son.\nREVEREND MARCUS: Oh, I'm sorry. (thinks) I can get you the roster from our Men's Group, if that'll help.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Thank you.\n(leaving the church with the roster)\nOLIVIA: There are over forty names on this list.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: We'll have to split up. Call Lincoln and Charlie.\nOLIVIA: (talking on her cell phone as she enters the building) No, nothing yet... although this church is full of true believers. One guy actually told me that the Reverend cured his kidney disease. So what about Charlie and Lincoln?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (over the phone) No luck yet. They've interviewed seven men on the list, and none of them fit the profile.\nOLIVIA: (approaches the front door of her next interview) Okay, I'm here. I'll, uh-- I'll call you in a bit. (knocks and is received) Wyatt Toomy? Agent Dunham. (flashes her ID and badge) I'm with Fringe Division. I need to ask you a couple questions in regard to an investigation. Can I come in?\nWYATT TOOMY: Sure. (looks at a picture of Max) Yeah. Saw him on the news. It's real sad. You really think someone from the church may have taken him?\nOLIVIA: Possibly. Yeah.\nWYATT TOOMY: Excuse me for a moment. So did you meet Reverend Marcus? (removes food from the stove)\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWYATT TOOMY: He is a miracle worker. Great man. Touched by God. (places his food on the dining room table)\nOLIVIA: (after they both focus on the child's doll visible on the far side of the room) Do you live here alone, Mister Toomy?\nWYATT TOOMY: Yep. Just me.\nOLIVIA: Don't move! (charges after him and gets a door slammed in her face) Ugh! (draws her pistol and calls for back-up on her phone) This is Agent Dunham. I'm at 1068 Kent Street, Apartment Five. The suspect's been sighted. I need backup now, please. (finds a curtained opening at the back of a closet and enters a hidden room. the abducted child rests on a bed) Max. Hi. Uh, I'm with the F.B.I. Are you okay? Okay. (notices the device on the back of Max head) Oh. (Wyatt Toomy charges in with a sawed-off shotgun. Olivia fires into him several times, ending his attack) Hey, (to Max) you okay? You sure? Alright. (hugs the boy tightly)\nOLIVIA: (standing near Toomy's corpse. to her boss) The paramedics took Max to the hospital. His mother's gonna meet him there. The Super said that Wyatt Toomy had been living here for almost nine years. Kept to himself, always paid his rent a week in advance.\nAGENT FRANCIS: (from the another room) Hey. You guys should take a look at this.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (joins his agents) Have you figured out what he was doing?\nLINCOLN LEE: (standing over a bench of equipment and distiller) We won't know exactly until we get this back to the lab, but my guess is Olivia was right.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: About what?\nLINCOLN LEE: Seems he was making some kind of age-regression serum. (hands over an ID with the image of an older Wyatt) He was extracting hormones from the kids and giving them to himself.\nOLIVIA: Your son was right. There was a young and an old suspect. It's just that they were the same man.\nAGENT FRANCIS: This guy worked in sanitation. How'd he figure out how to do all this? (loudly to surrounding agents) Alright, let's bag and tag it.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (somberly to Olivia) I won't forget what you did here.\nLINCOLN LEE: (to Olivia, after the Colonel walks away) Hey. When you're done here, you want to join me and Charlie for a beer? We get a lot of bad days. We got to celebrate the good ones.\nOLIVIA: No, thanks. (pats him on the arm) I'm going home.\nOLIVIA: (approaches a smaller commercial vessel) Hey.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You're nineteen minutes late. I had one more minute, and I was out of here.\nOLIVIA: Wow, you really think this thing is gonna take us across the harbor?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Don't worry about the boat. Worry about the patrols around that island.\nOLIVIA: Hey Henry, I know I'm asking a lot of you if you want to back out...\nHENRY HIGGINS: Come on. Let's just get it over with, okay?\nOLIVIA: You want me to cast us off?\nHENRY HIGGINS: What? (befuddled)\nOLIVIA: Do you want me to untie the boat from the dock?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Oh, yeah, yeah. Do that. Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Henry, you have done this before, right?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Want to know the truth?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Water scares the hell out of me. (trying to convince her as much as he is trying to convince himself) Look, don't worry. My cousin ran me through everything I need to know. We'll be fine. Just do that -- that casting thing. What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: Someone had to teach you how to do it.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah, so what? I told you I'm not a boater.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (from his office. calling home and leaving voicemail) Hey, Hon. When you hear this, give me a call. I shouldn't be here too much longer. (hangs-up and immediately answers an incoming call) Hey, I just left you a message.\nOLIVIA: (calling from dockside) Hey. Uh, I think we were wrong. Wyatt Toomy was not a scientist. He needed someone to show him how to make the serum.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Who?\nOLIVIA: Reverend Marcus. He said that he was a doctor. I think that's how he's been healing his congregation. He's been dosing them. Wyatt was working for him.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dear God.\nOLIVIA: Well, Christopher was right all along. There really were two suspects.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (hurries to leave the office and rush home) I told Reverend Marcus Chris could I.D. the voices he heard, and now my wife isn't picking up the phone.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'll meet you at your house. (hangs-up turns to her cabbie) Henry, I gotta go do something. Can you promise me that you will wait for me? Please?\nHENRY HIGGINS: Where the hell are you going?\n(Christopher rests in bed and is jolted awake by his mother's scream. in the living room, a masked man gags Diane Broyles until she passes out. the intruder enters the young man's room and finds the bed empty. he starts to search the rest of the house)\nREVEREND MARCUS: (announcing to whoever can hear him. Chris hides behind a grill) You want to play hide-and-seek, young man? I'll find you. God wants me to find you. I'm simply carrying out his plan. Take comfort, Christopher. You gave so much of yourself to help heal others. (walks past the boy's hiding place) We all have to make sacrifices for the common good.\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: (as the intruder pulls him from the cabinet he was hiding in) No! No! No! No! No! No!\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Hey!\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: Let go of me!\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Chris! (fires at, and hits the masked intruder)\nCHRISTOPHER BROYLES: Dad. (runs to safety and a hug)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You're safe, son. You're okay now. (holds his tearful child tightly)\n(the Broyles family congregate and console one another in a recovery room)\nHENRY HIGGINS: (calling from the docks) Where are you? It's been an hour. What's the deal with you?\nOLIVIA: (answer the question out of earshot of her boss) I'm leaving now. Just give me fifteen minutes.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Make it fast. I'm starting to get seasick. (ends call)\nEMILY CLAYTON: (approaches in the hallway) Agent Dunham? I thought that was you.\nOLIVIA: Missus Clayton, how is Max doing?\nEMILY CLAYTON: Doctors think you got there just in time. Now, he hasn't been able to stop talking about you. It'd really mean a lot if you could say hi. (joins her son in his room with a visitor) Hey, Max, someone's here to see you.\nMAX CLAYTON: Hi.\nOLIVIA: Hi. (joins him on the bed) How are you feeling?\nMAX CLAYTON: Much better now.\nOLIVIA: That's good. You're a real brave kid, you know that?\nMAX CLAYTON: Well, not as brave as you. Can I ask you a question?\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nMAX CLAYTON: What's F.B.I.?\nOLIVIA: F.B.I.? (taken aback) Where'd you hear that?\nMAX CLAYTON: Well, you said it when you saved me. Remember? You said you were F.B.I.\nOLIVIA: Oh. F.B.I.'s just another word for police.\nMAX CLAYTON: Well, then when I grow up, I want to be F.B.I. too.\nOLIVIA: That'd be nice. (upbeat) Now, you should get some rest, because it's late.\nMAX CLAYTON: Okay.\nOLIVIA: (turns to see the Colonel eavesdropping from the doorway) Bye.\nMAX CLAYTON: Bye.\nOLIVIA: (joins her boss in the corridor) How's your wife and son?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: They're gonna be fine. In fact, the doctors are gonna take a look at the serum Wyatt Toomy was synthesizing. It may have some healing potential for Christopher and the other victims.\nOLIVIA: Well, that's great. Maybe some good could come out of all this.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dunham... the F.B.I. ceased to exist over a decade ago... at least on this side it did. You know who you are, don't you?\nOLIVIA: (realizes she has been discovered) What happens now?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (pauses) Now... I'm going home.\n(Henry taxis the vessel to within a few hundred yards of Liberty Island and shuts down the engines)\nOLIVIA: Henry, don't worry. Just stick to the same bearings on your way out, and you won't run into any of their patrols.\nHENRY HIGGINS: What makes you so sure?\nOLIVIA: 'cause I memorized the routes when I escaped from there.\nHENRY HIGGINS: How you plan on getting up there?\nOLIVIA: (stares at the well-lit statue of Lady Liberty) I'll manage. Thank you... for everything.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Hey, I just borrowed a boat.\nOLIVIA: No. You believed in me.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You got me all the way the hell out here. You might as well tell me -- where is it you're from?\nOLIVIA: I'm from a parallel universe. (dives into the dark waters from the stern of the ship and begins to swim to the island)\nRADIO CHATTER: Copy that. (as Olivia scales the dark seawall to the government facility, scales the chain link fence and avoids detection by the security detail. Inside, she continues toward Brandon's lab, hides from the patrolling military personnel and uses her key card to access the lab)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (sitting in the back of his vehicle as it is driven, he answers the call on his earpiece) Yes.\nHEAD MP: (over the phone) Sir, there's been a security breach. Someone's accessed the lab on Liberty Island.\n(inside the lab, Olivia initializes the tank, secures the drugs she needs, then injects them into her forearm, dons a respirator and enters the tank. after a few seconds with her eyes closed, she materializes in the gift shop on Liberty Island in this universe. she quickly looks around then heads to the doors to leave. delayed by the locked doors, she gets some company)\nCLEANING LADY: (walking out from a back room) Ma'am, what are you -- we're -- we're closed.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. I was just, uh... would you be able to let me out? (politely. then worried as she starts to phase in and out between universes) No, no. Please, this can't be happening. I'm not gonna hurt you. I need you to listen very carefully. What I'm going to say is gonna sound insane, but I need you to do something for me. (back in the tank in the alternate universe she struggles underwater as the security detail reaches in to pull her out) No! No! No! Please. Please, I don't belong here!\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (stern order) Sedate her.\nOLIVIA: (fiercely resisting) Oh, God! Please let me go!\n(friends with benefits, Bolivia and Peter, are curled-up under the covers as the classic movie Casablanca plays on the TV. Bolivia dozes while Peter watches)\nRICK (on-screen): Who are you, really, and what were you before? What did you do, and what did you think, huh?\nILSA (on-screen): We said 'no questions'.\nPETER: (softly to the woman resting on his arm) You know, I can turn it off if you want to go to sleep.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (woozy) I'm just resting my eyes.\nPETER: Right. Otherwise known as sleeping.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, don't you want to see how it ends?\nPETER: I've seen this movie about a hundred times.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh.\nPETER: (in serious disbelief) You're honestly telling me you've never seen Casablanca?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (wild guess) I've heard of it. It's, uh -- It's Ronald Reagan, right?\nPETER: (laughs) No. It's Humphrey Bogart.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh. I was kidding. Okay, so let me guess. They, uh -- they end up running away together, and -- and they live happily ever after?\nPETER: Actually, no. She leaves him at the airport, and they never see each other again.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh. I thought you said it was a love story.\nPETER: Well, aren't all the best love stories tragedies?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Only in the movies. (chuckles) Come on. (snuggles) Let's go to sleep. (kisses)\nPETER: Good night.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Good night.\nPETER: (turns out the light and gets a call on his phone) Oh, you've got to be kidding me. (answers) Hello? Walter, is that you? I can hear you breathing.\nCLEANING LADY: (calling from Liberty Island) Is this Peter Bishop?\nPETER: Yes.\nCLEANING LADY: (distressed) I'm calling from New York. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes.\nPETER: Who is this?\nCLEANING LADY: Her name was Olivia. She has a message for you. She's trapped in the other universe. (hangs-up)"

(answers) Hello? (listens) Walter, is that you? I can hear you breathing.\nCLEANING LADY: (calling from Liberty Island) Is this Peter Bishop?\nPETER: Yes.\nCLEANING LADY: (distressed) I'm calling from New York. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes.\nPETER: Who is this?\nCLEANING LADY: Her name was Olivia. She has a message for you. She's trapped in the other universe. (hangs-up)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Who is it?\nPETER: (hesitates) Apparently I'm eligible for unprecedented savings.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Unprecedented savings at Midnight?\nPETER: Well, it's never too late for savings.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Apparently not. I think that you should save their number and call them back when they're sleeping.\nPETER: Blocked.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh.\n(Peter lays awake for several hours, waiting. he slips quietly from the bedroom and starts to inspect items in the drawer. he continues looking in a file box and a card index. he studies a small sheet of cheap, romantic, carnival images they took together. he picks-up her laptop computer, sitting near his identical laptop, and moves to where he can keep an eye on her as she sleeps. he attempts to open the password secure files with no luck. he is joined in the family room)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What you doing?\nPETER: (bleary-eyed lie) Just sending an e-mail.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: At two-fifteen?\nPETER: Well, it's not two-fifteen in Greece. Thought I'd catch up with a friend in Corinth.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You got a friend in Corinth?\nPETER: Yeah. And like he always says... Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What does it mean?\nPETER: It means, be a better man than your father. His dad's not great at communicating either, so we have that in common. I vowed I'd stay in touch.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh. I'm going back to bed. You coming?\nPETER: Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm just gonna grab a glass of water.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. (Peter opens and closes the cabinet demonstratively. then returns to find Bolivia leveling her pistol at him)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I failed the test, didn't I? What did it mean? The Greek phrase.\nPETER: It meant exactly what I said it meant... but it was Olivia who said it to me, not some friend.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How'd you figure me out? It had something to do with that phone call, didn't it?\nPETER: How'd you do it? How'd you replace our Olivia? You were with us when we came back from the other side, weren't you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You have a lot of questions. I understand. But you can understand that I can't give you the answers.\nPETER: This from the woman standing in front of me in pajamas who just shared the same bed with me. I guess answers is where you draw the line.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's not realistic to think that I wouldn't do what I came here to do. (tosses him a small case with a vial and a syringe)\nPETER: (studies the vial) Is this gonna kill me?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (as he sits to inject himself) Not if you do it right. Five cc's should be enough.\nPETER: So why are you here? What was the assignment? That's alright. (fills syringe) I wouldn't tell me either. 'cause if you're telling the truth and this doesn't kill me, the last thing you want me to have is information.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You gonna come after me? You gonna kill me?\nPETER: No, I'm gonna get answers. And if I find out that you did anything to Olivia, then I'm going to kill you. (injects his arm)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (whispers to him as he starts to fade and blur) The effects of the paralysis will wear off in a few hours.\nSTORE OWNER: (startled from behind as he arrives and unlocks the front door of the business) Holy -- Oh.\n(inside, he opens the cash drawer on the register, takes the key to the covert communications room in the back, then hands it to Bolivia. she sits and types her mission situation on the Selectric 251)\nFBI EMT: Any nausea?\nPETER: (answers gingerly as he sits and is tended to) Yeah. Bit of a headache too.\nFBI EMT: On a scale of one to ten?\nPETER: Tequila hangover or something like that.\nBROYLES: (enters. disappointed) Eight weeks... and none of us suspected anything. Did she give you any indication at all where she was headed? Anything you might have overlooked?\nPETER: Not that I could think of.\nFBI EMT: I'll get these to the lab, sir.\nWALTER: I'd like some samples sent to my lab as well as quickly as possible.\nPETER: Any luck running that call that came in to my cell phone?\nBROYLES: All we know is that it was made from a Manhattan pay phone at twelve twenty-one A.M. There's no way of knowing who placed it.\nWALTER: Odd. It seems that Olivia was able to cross over momentarily, but unable to stay here.\nPETER: Well, we got to get her back. So how do we get over there, Walter?\nWALTER: Crossing over is out of the question. Not without Olivia's help. But there may be something I haven't thought of yet.\nBROYLES: Peter, you said she administered the paralytic at two fifteen A.M. Now what were you doing here at two fifteen A.M.?\nWALTER: (bumbling interception of the question. lying) Olivia called our house. She thought she heard someone trying to enter her apartment. And of course--\nPETER: Walter, you don't have to cover for me. Since we came back from over there, Olivia and I became something more than friends.\nBROYLES: (genuinely did not know) I see.\nWALTER: It's perfectly understandable, son. In the 'Seventies', I innocently wandered into the wrong home and it was three days before I realized my mistake. And unlike Olivia, the woman with whom I was sharing a bed didn't look like my wife at all.\nPETER: (suddenly realizes) She took the wrong computer. I was searching her computer last night and she caught me, but I convinced her that it was mine.\nBROYLES: What's on it?\nPETER: I don't know. It was encrypted. (shows everyone the passworded screen)\nBROYLES: (barks into the other room) Hernandez, I want access to every file on this computer.\nSTORE OWNER: (bitter and complaining) That's what they do, isn't it? They make you wait for 'em. I've been waiting... for seven years. Your kind isn't so good at keeping promises. But I guess you've got it all under control.\n(Bolivia slams her portable computer closed after realizing she grabbed the incorrect one from the apartment)\n(Colonel Broyles arrives at the DoD facility on the island and heads inside for his meeting with Secretary Bishop)\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (standing before the Secretary while he sits at his desk and studies the latest communique) Agent Dunham hasn't completed her mission yet.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: No, but we can't worry about that now. We need to provide her with an extraction point.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Well, sir, last time we swapped an entire steel bridge with you on it.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (sternly) The principle is the same. You simply need to narrow the harmonic field to focus on something smaller. A single person. We'll use the girl. I've gotten all we need from her and obviously they have equivalent mass. Pull your team off whatever they're doing. I need a time and a location for Agent Dunham.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (candidly) Alive or dead? How do you want to send back their Olivia? Alive or dead? Because I feel there are very valuable parts for study and I would just have to replace her mass. (leaves the office shortly thereafter and finds the next visitor... to Colonel Broyles) He's ready for you.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (once Broyles has joined him in his office) Someone helped her get past our patrols onto this island. Whoever the traitor is, they don't understand our goals. To save our world from destruction. Our people. Our families. I know that you know this as well as I do, Philip. For the past twenty years, our world has been breaking apart because of what they did. And now with what we've discovered about how that girl crosses over, we are about to turn the tide. Only one world can survive. And finally we have made strides so that it can be ours. (hands Broyles a cocktail) Our Olivia will be returning shortly. Her mission over there was a success.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (toasts, ironically) To her safe return.\n(in the corridor, after Broyles passes her room, two orderlies drag Olivia out)\nOLIVIA: (fiercely resisting) No! No! No! No, please! No! No! (turns and sees a disheartened Broyles staring at the commotion) Please, please, please help me! I -- Let me go! I can't-- (as she is hauled away)\n(what is left of the science team brainstorms the possibilities and laments at the deception they suffered)\nOLIVIA: (on a digitally recorded video just days after she liberated Walter from Saint Claire's in 2008) Despite his obvious eccentricities, Doctor Bishop has been very helpful.\nBROYLES: (on video) And Peter?\nOLIVIA: (on video) He's been helpful too. I like him.\nPETER: (to the team) So this is how she learned about us? Is there anything in there about how she communicates with the other side?\nASTRID: So far, besides Olivia's debriefs, just files on all the cases we handled.\nWALTER: I'm a fraud. A failure. Four hours of intense meditation augmented by a precise two-gram dose of Brown Betty and I've got nothing. There is no way to cross over safely. I'm afraid I have failed you. I am sorry. And I have failed Olivia.\nPETER: Walter, you haven't failed us or her. (to Broyles as he enters the lab) Any news?\nBROYLES: So far, our task force has recovered seventeen pieces of Walternate's device. At five-thirty this morning, the other Olivia used her clearance to access the aircraft hangar where they're being stored. She took this. (hands a photo of one of the device components to Peter)\nPETER: Well, that explains why she's here. Walternate couldn't find all the pieces to the machine on the other side. (walks to his bulletin board covered in drawings, images and blueprints) So he must have sent her over to retrieve it.\nBROYLES: But if her mission is complete...\nPETER: Then she may be going home.\nBROYLES: (to Peter) And not only may Walternate be able to complete this device, but if we lose her, we lose our chance to use her to get Olivia back. (to Walter) Doctor Bishop... any thoughts on how she would cross to the other side?\nWALTER: No. Nothing. (somberly eats one of the malassada pastries that Bolivia recently brought to cheer him up) And I have no idea how to bring our Olivia back. It's all because of that temptress. She tricked my son with her carnal manipulations and he fell right into her vagenda.\nASTRID: Vagenda?\nWALTER: Like Mata Hari using her feminine wiles to accomplish her evil ends. And I too fell prey. She used my stomach to get through to my heart.\nASTRID: (studies the pastry box brought by Bolivia) Hey, Walter... didn't she tell you she always brought these back when she went to the Federal Building? This bakery is in The Bronx. (to the group) Why would she go there?\nPETER: Because she must know somebody there.\nBROYLES: Let me see that address.\n(Bolivia returns to the sequestered communications room when the typewriter becomes active. she removes the letter and learns what she needs to do next)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (joins the store owner upfront) You want new legs? There's one more thing I need you to do for me.\n(Broyles drives and stops close to the bakery. the Bishops help him explore the neighborhood and interview the locals)\nPETER: So why would she be coming here? (scanning the area)\nBROYLES: (hands-out photos to use) Let's split up and show her picture around.\nWALTER: (eager to help) I'll take the pastry shop.\nSTORE OWNER: (as Peter enters the shop) Help you?\nPETER: Yeah, I hope so. I'm looking for a woman who frequents this area. You've seen her before? (holds up photo)\nSTORE OWNER: (casually) No. Can't say I have.\nPETER: You sure?\nSTORE OWNER: Yeah.\nPETER: (starts looking around the shop) Typewriters, huh? Seems like kind of a high-rent area to be selling something so retro.\nSTORE OWNER: People come from all over the city. I specialize in stuff that's hard to find.\nPETER: (turns and sees his laptop computer resting nearby) Yeah, I can see that. I can also see my computer right here.\n(in the communication room after Walter and Broyles have joined the interview)\nSTORE OWNER: Hey, they promised me new legs.\nBROYLES: (to the owner after looking at the Selectric 251 typewriter) How does it work?\nSTORE OWNER: I don't know. No, really, I don't. They just come here.\nWALTER: (opens the machine and starts inspecting) It's a quantum entangled telegraph. It's a machine that could communicate between universes. It's fascinating.\nPETER: (starts to remove the ink ribbon) Well, if it works anything like a normal typewriter--\n(reads the tape)\n...NEEDED. PENN STATION. NEWARK, NJ PETER: Penn Station. Newark.\n(Colonel Broyles sits in a moderately somber bar, at the counter, while he and a few dozen other patrons watch footage on the big screen television of a disastrous Fringe event from two decades earlier, to the day. An alternate version of Ray Orbison's song \"You Got It\" plays in the bar.)\nBARTENDER: (sees the Fringe Task Force ballcap on the counter as the Colonel starts to pay and leave) Oh, no, no, no. Your money's no good here, sir. Times are tough. It's nice to know we have heroes.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Thank you.\n(Olivia gets a visitor in her small holding cell as she sits on the floor and dabbles with her food)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I wanted to come and see you. Thank you for not giving me up. You easily could have.\nOLIVIA: How is your son?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: He's sleeping through the night again. We owe that to you. I want you to know that I realize that. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?\nOLIVIA: That's not why you're here. You're here to make yourself more comfortable.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Maybe.\nOLIVIA: Do you know what they're gonna do to me? (pulls back her bangs) Why I have these marks on my forehead? They're sending me back. They're gonna swap me for your Olivia. But they're gonna kill me first. They're gonna cut out my brain... and study it. (begs) Please help me. If you can get me out of here, I can get myself home.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I can't. My world is dying because of what your side is doing to us. If I help you escape --\nOLIVIA: No. Despite what you think, my universe is not at war with yours. This all began because a man came over here to save a boy and twenty-five years later, I came back to save that same boy. But if you let me die, then we will strike back and we will fight. But if you let me go, both universes can survive. There must be another way and I promise you I will find it. Two floors up, there's a lab there. If you can get me in there, then I can get myself back home.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: And if you're lying? You'd say anything right now because your life depends on it, but what if your side has every intention of our destruction? Am I supposed to just hope you're telling me the truth?\nOLIVIA: If you don't trust me... then there is no hope. (a technician enters the cell and prepares an injection)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: (tugs on his jacket) Please. Please. (watches as he exits, turns to contemplate her situation, then turn and walk quickly away)\nDIANE BROYLES: So are you gonna tell me? Or are we gonna keep on pretending that there isn't something on your mind?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I have a decision to make.\nDIANE BROYLES: Okay.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Remember when I joined Fringe Division?\nDIANE BROYLES: Mm-hmm.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Two weeks into the job, we had that vortex in the East River. A hundred and sixty-five people swallowed up. Half of 'em kids. And it's gotten even worse since then. Now we may actually have a chance to start to put our world back together. Fix it. Only thing is, to do that, We're gonna have to go to war. A lot of lives will be lost. An unimaginable number. And I don't know if I can live with that. There may be another option, but it could put everything at risk. Either way, who am I to play God With other people's lives? Who am I to make that choice?\nDIANE BROYLES: Twenty years ago, I knew that you were the right man to protect our world. After all these years, I've never stopped believing that. I think this world is in as much pain as it can stand. We need to restore hope.\nBROYLES: (on his cell phone as he drives quickly) Tell your people she's armed and dangerous, but she has to be taken alive. She may be the only chance we have to recover our agent.\nCOMMAND POST: (on phone) Understood, sir.\nBROYLES: Good. I'll call you when we get close. (hangs-up) Doctor Bishop, any thoughts?\nWALTER: Several. Not many of them pleasant, however.\nBROYLES: I meant do you have any idea why she's headed to Penn Station? Do you think she's trying to cross to the other side? Is there a soft spot there?\nWALTER: No. Not as far as I know.\nBROYLES: Peter, we'll get her. And we're going to bring Olivia home.\nPETER: Glad you're feeling so confident.\nBROYLES: She was strong enough to get us a message. And if there were anyone I would bet on to survive over there, It would be her.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Spin her. What's her heart rate?\nOPERATING ASSISTANT: Sixty resting. Should I give her more sedative?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: No, if her heart rate lowers any more, we won't be able to preserve her organs. Why don't you go prepare the coolers in the receiving room? (activates bone saw. responds to intruder at the door) Excuse me! You're not allowed to be -- {shot\/darted by muffled weapon)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (to Olivia after he flips her upright and starts to release her restraints) We don't have much time. We have to get out of here. Come on. Get up. (prepares a large syringe of adrenaline)\nOLIVIA: (disorientated) You came back for me.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Don't thank me yet. I have to give you adrenaline.\nOLIVIA: Oh, no. Please don't don't do-- (as the syringe punctures her sternum) --Ah! ... (later, after she sprints down the corridor and they enter an elevator) Whew! Man, that hurt.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Sorry.\nOLIVIA: Don't be.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: The ground floor? What's there?\nOLIVIA: The lab. They have a deprivation tank there.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: And that'll help you cross over?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, it's something to do with the lack of sensory input.\n(Brandon's assistant returns and finds his dead body in the dissection lab)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What is it? (studies a container holding several intravenous drip bags with her name on them and a reddish fluid inside)\nOLIVIA: I'm not positive, but I think it's Cortexiphan.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What's that?\nOLIVIA: It's a long story, but if I'm right, this is why they stopped their experiments on me. 'cause they found what they needed and it could help your people cross over to my side. (unveils the tank) They emptied the tank. I - I - I can't cross over. (as the security alarms blare)\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (as the alarm continues to blare) Come on. We have to go.\nOLIVIA: No, you've done enough. Now if I can just get to the other side of the island, then maybe I could swim for it. I've done it before. Then I've got to get to Boston.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What's in Boston?\nOLIVIA: The Secretary has a lab there at Harvard just like my Walter Bishop on the other side.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: And your Walter has a deprivation tank, so you think the Secretary may have had one too?\nOLIVIA: (collects some Cortexiphan to take with her) Well, they're genetically identical, so they think alike and, yeah, it's possible. I can't think of anything--\nCOLONEL BROYLES: They've changed the harbor patrols. You'll never make it. But I can get you there. Come on.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (answers call on his earpiece) Hello?\nCOMMAND POST: (over the phone) Sir, there's been an incident at Liberty Island.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What kind of incident?\nCOMMAND POST: Olivia Dunham is gone.\nCOFFEE VENDOR: Here you go. Best coffee West of the Passaic. You want cream and sugar?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. You can keep the change.\nLUKE: (approaches from behind as she sips her beverage) Some things are gonna be hard to leave behind. Come on. Time for you to go home. (inside a public restroom, after they have secured it with closed for maintenance signs) You know, I sometimes dream about it. The other side. (as he prepares an injection pistol) Sadly, for my kind, coming here is a one-way ticket.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I thought your kind didn't care.\nLUKE: Give me your right hand. Palm up. (swabs the palm) Eight identities in the last five years, but this has been my favorite. (looks in mirror) I seem to be a big hit with the ladies. You may want to close your eyes.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (as he injects her) Ah!\nBROYLES: (after parking amid the gathering law enforcers outside of the station) Have you spotted her?\nLEAD COP: No. There are six entrances to the building. We've got a team on each one of them.\nBROYLES: (hands a pistol to Peter) Don't shoot yourself.\nWALTER: (sincerely) No gun for me.\nBROYLES: (flatly) Good idea. (as they enter the station)\nLUKE: (still in the restroom. finishes the second injection) Okay, turn around, lift up the back of your shirt.\nBROYLES: (in the lobby spaces the gathering officers) Let's split up. You three, with me.\nLUKE: (preparing the third injection with Bolivia bent over a wash sink) The transfer's scheduled for four o'clock. That's in precisely twenty-three minutes.\nCAPTIVE MOM: (not yet in peril. barges into the restroom) Oh, I'm sorry. I know you're cleaning, but I really have to -- (sees what she is interrupting)\nPETER: (spots Luke and Bolivia as they exit the restroom) Dunham! Freeze! (Bolivia fires into the air and starts a panic in the crowd. over his tactical radio) I got her. She's in the Northwest bathroom. (once he is joined by Broyles and back-up) She's in there with another guy. (points across the lobby)\nBROYLES: (over his tactical radio) I want two teams. One from the West and one from the East.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (dragging her freshly shifted accomplice along as a human shield\/captive mom) Okay. Put your guns down or I will shoot her. Put your guns down or I will kill her!\nBROYLES: (to the team) Put 'em down.\nUPSET DAUGHTER: (screams and runs toward Bolivia's human shield she thinks she knows as her mother) Oh, my gawd. Mom! Mom!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Don't you make me kill her.\nUPSET DAUGHTER: Mom!\nPETER: (changing the shifter for personal knowledge) What's your daughter's name? Your daughter's name! What is it? (hesitates. studies the target and fires into its' forehead. mercury begins to spill from the wound)\nUPSET DAUGHTER: Mom! (thinking she just saw her mother killed)\nBROYLES: (to Bolivia) Drop your weapon now! (to his agents) Take her.\nPETER: (later, during clean-up) Where is she? Where's Olivia? Tell me how we get her back.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't know. That wasn't part of my assignment. Listen, whatever happens to me, I want you to know that this started out as an assignment, but it became...\nPETER: ...something more. That would be so much easier to believe if you weren't in handcuffs right now.\nUNIFORMED COP: Mister Bishop?\nPETER: Yeah?\nUNIFORMED COP: We found this in the bathroom. (soft case baggage) No sign of the component she stole, but we also found the second body.\nPETER: Thank you. (takes the bag and finds the sheet of 'couples photos' they took together)\n(Olivia and the Colonel arrive at Secretary Bishop's abandoned lab and Olivia finds the tank straight-away)\nBROYLES: (as they study the old piece of equipment) So what do we do now?\nOLIVIA: (after filling the tank with water and solubles to help her float) Okay, I think that's it. (Broyles prepares the Cortexiphan)\nTACTICAL TEAM: Move in. Go, go, go! (approaching the lab rapidly)\nOLIVIA: (hears the raiding team approach) They're here. How did they find us?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Subcutaneous tracker. (displays the small lump in his wrist) I'm too important to lose. Look, I've seen war. But if what you're saying is true, In the end, I have to believe in hope. Please make this worth it. Go! (closes the doors to the tank after she enters.)\nDoD MP #1: Colonel Broyles, you are under arrest. Where's the girl? Freeze! Don't move! She's in the tank! Open it up! (Olivia bolts when something seems to have changed)\nASTRID: (turns and looks at the tank as the doors start to open and the water inside sloshes. drops her lab supplies at the sight.) Olivia? (Olivia collapses to the floor) Olivia! Oh, God.\nBROYLES: (briefs an aid as Bolivia is cuffed into the transport truck) I want a three-car escort, half-mile buffer zone all the way to Boston.\nWALTER: Hmm.\nPETER: \"hmm\" what?\nWALTER: These look familiar. (studies the pins that were with the shapeshifters injection gun)\nPETER: Familiar how?\nWALTER: I don't know yet.\n(alone and secured in the paddy wagon, Bolivia's hands begin to glow orange\/red at the injection sites\nWALTER: (taps one of the pins he has been studying and listens to it resonate) E minor. It's pretty.\nBROYLES: (returning from his call) That was Astrid. Olivia's back.\nPETER: (amazed. yuh) She's what?\nBROYLES: Apparently she crossed over into your father's lab. Astrid's with her. They're in an ambulance on their way to Boston general.\nPETER: Why Boston General? Is she okay?\nBROYLES: They think she had some kind of seizure.\nPETER: Alright, I'm going to see Olivia.\nWALTER: (still focused on the pin) Peter?\nPETER: Walter, just stay--\nWALTER: No. I remember why this is familiar. They're harmonic rods. Like Belly and I used to use to help objects cross between universes. And this was found in their Olivia's bag?\nPETER: Yes. (the ground rumbles and Bolivia's transport truck shakes from side to side. then with pistol drawn as he and Walter find the contents of the truck that replaced Bolivia) Broyles! Broyles, stop. I don't think you want to see this. (he does. he meets the mangled, maimed and scorched alternate universe version of himself)\nLINCOLN LEE: (catches her as she strolls in from the elevator lobby) Hey, Liv, check this out. No more pain. No more burns. I'm as good as new. It's like nothing ever happened.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Just like nothing ever happened.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Excuse me, Agents. Have you seen Colonel Broyles? He's late to work this morning.\nLINCOLN LEE: Have you tried calling him?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, I tried calling him at home too and his wife said that he did not come home last night and that is very unlike him.\n(Phillip Broyles studies and tends to his counterpart in the morgue and closes the eyes of Colonel Broyles)\nSTORE OWNER: (in a quiet reading space lined with books and storage files, the antique typewriter salesman prepares for the treatment he was promised. nervous as a big syringe is prepared) I've never been a big fan of needles. Doctors, needles, hospitals.\nTHE LIBRARIAN: Make a fist.\nSTORE OWNER: You know, when you're a kid and you're sick, You know, you just -- you come to hate 'em all. (barely tolerates the injection) Oh.\nTHE LIBRARIAN: Go ahead. Try 'em out.\nSTORE OWNER: That's it?\nTHE LIBRARIAN: Only one way to find out.\nSTORE OWNER: (finds his way to his feet and manages to walk without the aid of his crutches) Wow. Thank you.\nTHE LIBRARIAN: Thank you. (takes out the ancient component that was just delivered to him and studies it)\nOLIVIA: (groggy) Peter.\nPETER: (humble) I'm sorry, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Don't apologize. You were the only thing that got me through. If it wasn't for you, I would never have made it back. You saved my life. (he leans forward and kisses her on the forehead)"

Final boarding call. Eastbound express, Track 18.\nGRANT RUSSO: (after getting tapped in the side of leg with the umbrella) Excuse me.\nROLAND BARRETT: I'm sorry. So, so sorry.\n(Russo makes it home while the man who taped him with his umbrella waits outside for him to succumb to the drugging he induced)\nROLAND BARRETT: Yes, hello. Sure. Yes, uh, there's a man here in need of medical attention - - 5776 Dower Street. Yeah, he's injured very badly. Please hurry. Cheers. (to Russo as he prepares a syringe) I'm so sorry, sir. But, uh... there's no other way.\nEMT #2: There's no details on this one.\nEMT JOE: Never a good sign.\nEMT #2: Hello? Did somebody call 9-1-1? Someone call 9-1-1? Hello? (to Joe) Call this in.\nEMT JOE: Dispatch, we're looking at a possible homicide. Requesting backup.\nDISPATCHER: Copy that. Stand by Unit 16. Unit 16, backup's en route to your location. Ten minutes out.\nEMT #2: (looks at the gaping hole in the victim's chest) Oh, my God. Joe, someone cut this guy's heart out. Get in here.\nGRANT RUSSO: Don't -- don't let me die.\n(Barrett returns to the train station carrying a small cooler)\nPUBLIC ANNOUNCER: Passengers holding monthly passes may pick up commuter express tickets at ticket window seven. Commuter express tickets, Ticket Window Seven. Baggage service desk, call 2133. Baggage service desk, call 2133.\nCONDUCTOR: All aboard!\nOLIVIA: (smiling and pert) Guess you weren't expecting me back so soon. (later. providing detailed assessment) Which led me to believe that Walternate's main priority was learning how to cross universes safely. He was using me to discover how.\nBROYLES: Do you think he's close?\nOLIVIA: His tests enabled him to synthesize Cortexiphan, so, yeah, I think he's close. And he is driven. The way he sees things, It's his world or ours. So I understand that the other Olivia escaped with a crucial part of the machine. Where is the rest of it?\nBROYLES: Science Division is analyzing the remaining pieces now.\nOLIVIA: I'd like to see the results.\nBROYLES: Of course. Once you're back. You're officially on leave until further notice. To say you've experienced a trauma is an understatement. You need to process what you've endured over the past two months.\nOLIVIA: I know, but I honestly believe that my ability to do my job isn't impaired.\nBROYLES: Your ability's not my only concern.\nOLIVIA: I'm not gonna deny that the last few months haven't taken their toll. But I made a promise to a friend over there. And I swore that I would do everything that I can to heal both worlds. I need to go back to work.\nBROYLES: This friend you're talking about... what was he like?\nOLIVIA: He wasn't that unlike you. He was honorable, committed. He feared for his family, for their future.\nBROYLES: So he had children?\nOLIVIA: A son and a daughter. And he was very close to his wife.\nBROYLES: And they were still married? (quiet. in deep reflection)\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nPETER: Come on, Walter! Let's go!\nWALTER: Coming! I thought it was in the closet. Aah! Wait.\nPETER: Where was it?\nWALTER: Bathroom. I'd forgotten that a couple of nights ago, I used my cauterizer to remove an uncomfortable growth between my...\nPETER: ... less information, better. (helps with the jacket)\nWALTER: Have you spoken to Olivia?\nPETER: I did. Called her last night. She's doing better, but still recuperating.\nWALTER: I understand how difficult it is to be candid with people that you care about, uh, particularly when it concerns matters that are intimate in nature.\nPETER: Ready to go?\nWALTER: Yes, I am. And by intimate, I mean sexual.\nPETER: Yeah, I got that.\n(during the drive to Rye, NY)\nWALTER: I know this is an instance of a parent asking a child to do as he says and not as he does.\nPETER: How many ways can I tell you that I don't want to have this conversation, Walter?\nWALTER: But you must have it.\nPETER: No, this conversation, the one that we're having right now. We're here.\n(after parking)\nWALTER: You understand better than most the pain a lie can inflict.\nPETER: Yes, I do... which is why, even though I expect it's going to fundamentally change how she feels about me, I am going to tell Olivia everything. Okay?\nWALTER: You're a good man, Peter. She knows that.\nWALTER: (gathering the team outside of Russo's House) Look who's here. Oh, it's good to see you out and about. Peter, look, it's Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Hi.\nPETER: Shouldn't you be resting?\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham has been cleared for duty.\nPETER: Alright, well, in that case, welcome back.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: You gonna tell us what we're in for?\nBROYLES: At approximately eight this morning, 9-1-1 received a call from inside this house. The caller said that there was someone inside in need of medical attention. When the EMTs arrived, they found the victim strapped to a table, chest cavity opened and his heart missing. But then, after they discovered him in that condition, the victim regained consciousness and spoke and then died three minutes later.\nWALTER: He was conscious and speaking without a functional cardiovascular system?\nBROYLES: It appears so.\nWALTER: Lady Fortuna has smiled upon us. (inside, as they start to inspect Russo's corpse) Where do you suppose I could pick up quality imported pickled herring?\nPETER: No idea. Why?\nWALTER: I'm thinking of Scandinavia.\nPETER: Scandinavia?\nWALTER: The Blood Eagle... a Norse method of torture -- (studying the surgical work on the table) breaking the ribs and spreading them out to resemble blood-stained wings.\nPETER: So we're looking for a Viking?\nWALTER: Whoever did this was trained. These incisions have been made with precision. This is beautiful work. Definitely not a Viking. They were ruthless. Peter, look at this.\nPETER: (looks at the heart plumbing of the victim) Scar tissue.\nWALTER: Yeah. He's had heart surgery before.\nPETER: Stay here. I'll be right back.\nWALTER: Well, it's impossible to determine the time of death, because in this case, the standards we generally use don't apply.\nBROYLES: What exactly does that mean?\nOLIVIA: (after Walter taps a nerve in the wrist of the victim) He still has reflexes?\nWALTER: Yes, and yet his heart was removed at least four hours ago. By now, rigor mortis should be starting to set in.\nBROYLES: So we're not even sure if he's dead?\nWALTER: Well, from what I can see, he's more dead than not.\nOLIVIA: Okay, what if somebody is harvesting organs -- on the black market?\nPETER: Not likely. (returns from another room with a large clear bag full of pill containers) This guy's medicine cabinet rivals some pharmacies. He's got everything in there -- steroids, immuno-suppressant\u2019s, anti-fungals, anti-biotics, pain medication.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so you wouldn't steal a heart from someone this sick if you were selling it.\nBROYLES: Who's the prescribing physician?\nPETER: Doctor Alexandra Ross.\nBROYLES: You two go talk to this Doctor Ross. Doctor Bishop, I'll arrange to transport the cadaver to your lab.\nWALTER: Oh, great. Perhaps there I'll be able to discover what made this tin man tick.\nPETER: (returning from the duty desk) Doctor Ross is still in surgery.\nOLIVIA: Okay, then we'll wait.\nPETER: You know you're drinking swill, right?\nOLIVIA: It's nice to be able to take a cup of coffee for granted.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: You know, when you go on vacation and you come back and some things are a revelation? Like coffee, or my favorite shoes. And then... other things are just... I don't know. My mail was opened. It's kind of disconcerting knowing that somebody else has been living your life. Hey. You okay?\nPETER: (somberly) There's something that I have to talk to you about... about her. I noticed... changes -- small changes, but they were definitely there. She's... she's much quicker with a smile and... less... I don't know -- less intense maybe. She said that when she was over there, what she saw of her other life, it made her want to change, to be happier. And I believed her, because that made sense.\nOLIVIA: There was no way for you to know. Everything happened so fast, I couldn't even tell you how they did it. And it's okay. (shrugs it off) I'm here now.\nPETER: When you asked me to come back to this world with you... you said...\nOLIVIA: ...that you belonged with me.\nPETER: And so I came back for you... for us. And we started seeing each other. And I explained away the differences because our relationship was different. I thought she was you, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: (slight embarrassment) Does everyone know?\nPETER: (earnest) I reported everything when I found out who she was. Olivia, I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: (apologetic) You know, she had a really full life, really sweet boyfriend. And if he hadn't been out of town, then who knows what could've happened? She had friends, people who loved her, people who -- who risked their lives to help her. And they all believed that I was her. (wants to shrug it off) So, you know, I \u2013 I - I can understand how that...\nNURSE: (finding the waiting investigators) Mister Bishop? Doctor Ross is out of surgery.\nPETER: (to the nurse) Could you give us a second, please?\nNURSE: Sure.\nPETER: Thank you.\nOLIVIA: Peter... it's fine. We're good. Let's go. (stands and leaves)\n(sitting across from one another in the Doctor's office)\nALEXANDRA ROSS: I don't understand. His heart was removed?\nPETER: We'd like to ask you about the medications that you prescribed him.\nALEXANDRA ROSS: Of course. It was the standard regimen for transplant recipients. Mister Russo suffered from congestive heart failure. He was on the list for over a year waiting for a donor.\nOLIVIA: He had a heart transplant?\nALEXANDRA ROSS: Yes. He wanted a second chance. We gave him one... or at least I thought we did.\n(in his makeshift operating room, Roland sutures closed the thoracic cavity of a lifeless young woman)\nROLAND BARRETT: It won't be long now. (caresses her forehead) It will be okay.\nASTRID: You sure it's called the Yatsko Project? Nina says that she checked Massive Dynamic's archives personally, and nothing came up under that heading.\nWALTER: Well, that can't be right. Belly and I created a serum similar to this in the mid-seventies. I'm certain of it. We were trying to devise a method to... of questioning someone after death.\nASTRID: Of course you were.\nWALTER: Tell her to look under pet projects. Perhaps the Yatsko research was folded in.\nASTRID: Okay. I'm leaving. Peter's giving you a ride home.\nWALTER: Oh.\nASTRID: He should be here any minute, Walter.\nPETER: Evening, everyone.\nWALTER: Peter. What wonderful timing.\nASTRID: You got the keys to lock up?\nPETER: Yeah. Yeah, no problem.\nASTRID: Alright, don't let him keep you here too late, okay? Good night, Walter.\nWALTER: Good night, Astrid. Peter, come here.\nPETER: Good night.\nWALTER: I want you to smell something, tell me what you deduce.\nPETER: Okay. What am I smelling?\nWALTER: Him. Notice anything?\nPETER: I'm not vomiting.\nWALTER: Precisely. By now, it should be emitting the unmistakable odor of putrefaction. This corpse's decomposition has slowed to almost zero.\nPETER: So what's arresting the decay?\nWALTER: That's a good question. Astrid and I isolated traces of a serum in his blood. It functions as a preservative, radically slowing down cell degradation.\nPETER: Why bother to slow down his death? They already stole his heart.\nWALTER: To assuage his conscience, of course.\nPETER: You think the type of people that would steal an organ out of a transplant patient would really be troubled by conscience?\nWALTER: He called 9-1-1. If the EMT's had got him on a heart-lung machine in time, he might have survived. It's highly unlikely, of course, but I'm betting it helps our organ thief sleep well at night.\nPETER: Well, at least somebody is.\nWALTER: You haven't told, Olivia, have you?\nPETER: Nope, actually, I did.\nWALTER: How did she react?\nPETER: Surprisingly well.\nWALTER: Really?\nPETER: Mm.\nWALTER: Do you think possibly they replaced her with a robot?\n(Olivia meltsdown in front of her washing machine after trashing her closet and her linens, upset at the personal invasion she endured)\nOLIVIA: (joins her junior assistant) Hey. Tell me there's more.\nASTRID: There's plenty. I just made a fresh pot.\nOLIVIA: Great.\nASTRID: Bad night?\nOLIVIA: I had a lot of laundry to go through.\nASTRID: How is it... being back?\nOLIVIA: It's good.\nASTRID: Yeah?\nOLIVIA: Strange. Peter told me what happened, you know, that he was seeing her. You know, I get it, but... you saw them together. What was he like with her? He didn't seem different? I mean... like, happier or...\nASTRID: Olivia...\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. We should go. Broyles wouldn't have called us in if he didn't have something.\nASTRID: Olivia, wait. He thought that she was with you.\nOLIVIA: I understand. It's fine.\nASTRID: It's not fine. Whatever feelings that Peter had, they were not about her. They were about you. And they were real. They still are.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, Astrid.\n(a briefing by the boss in his office)\nBROYLES: A cross-state search of police records turned up multiple organ thefts in the last two months. The incidents took place in five different states, but the M.O. of the crime is consistent.\nOLIVIA: You're saying the same person did all this?\nBROYLES: It appears so.\nPETER: Any of those organs transplants?\nBROYLES: They all were. And not only that, they're all from the same donor.\nOLIVIA: Do we have a name?\nBROYLES: We have a donor number. Names are kept confidential. Seventeen-year-old female. We've issued a priority request. We should know more shortly.\nPETER: Mind if I take a look? (starts to study the data file)\nASTRID: So he's gathering all of her organs. Why?\nBROYLES: There are some people who have strong objections to organ donation.\nOLIVIA: Maybe someone close to her didn't think the recipients were worthy.\nPETER: It says here after the organs were harvested, they remanded the custody of the body to the Rosindale Eye Bank. You think maybe her corneas were donated too?\nOLIVIA: There's no photos of them being stolen.\nBROYLES: (picks-up phone) Put me through to the Rosindale Eye Bank. (waits) Yes, this is Colonel Broyles with the FBI. I need to speak with your Executive Director immediately. (listens) Yes, it's urgent. Immediately means urgent. Thank you.\nROLAND BARRETT: (as he prepares to surgically remove the eyes of the organ recipient) So sorry, sir. These don't belong to you, do they?\nBROYLES: (on phone) Good. He wasn't at home. We're at his restaurant now. Thanks. (hangs-up) That was Astrid. We've got a name on the donor. Amanda Walsh -- her family lives in Providence. FBI's arranging an interview.\nPETER: (looks through window) There's a light on in back.\nOLIVIA: (moving to the interior of the seemingly unoccupied facility) Hello? Anybody there?\nPETER: Over here. (finds surgical implements)\nOLIVIA: We're too late. (hears thud)\nBEN KILLENBURG: (turns to Olivia as she discovers the newly blinded man) Please... help me.\nBEN KILLENBURG: (laying in bed with his eyes wrapped in bandages and gauze) I wanted to see how the construction was coming along. There was some paperwork to take care of. I was feeling fine. But as I was walking there, I started getting dizzy. Next thing I know, I'm strapped to a slab. (surprisingly concilatory) He actually apologized. Can you believe that? He said he wished there was another way, that they didn't belong to me.\nPETER: So Walter was right. We're dealing with a remorseful organ thief.\nOLIVIA: Well, that makes sense. He didn't want to hurt those people. It's about her. He didn't want her organs going to someone else.\nPETER: I'm gonna call Broyles, let him know we're on the way to talk to the family.\nGENE: (feeling cornered. unloved) Moo!\nASTRID: Walter, please tell me you're not giving Gene the evidence to drink.\nWALTER: (tinkering with a vial of liquid) Not until I understand the long-term side effects. But imagine the possibilities if this can permanently erase cell decay.\nASTRID: Milk that doesn't go bad.\nWALTER: And cheese.\nASTRID: Well, that dream is gonna have to wait, Walter. Here are the Yatsko Project files. Massive Dynamic just sent them over. You were right. They were misfiled. It turns out that the research that you and William Bell did on human-tissue preservation didn't stop when you went to Saint Claire's.\nWALTER: Interesting. I think we're on the precipice of understanding this.\nASTRID: More you than we.\nWALTER: I have a working hypothesis. Astrid, I need you to get me something. I need the organ donor.\nASTRID: Amanda Walsh.\nWALTER: I need her body... or what's left of it.\nMISSUS WALSH: Oh, gawd. The only consolation I had was her passing gave other people another chance.\nOLIVIA: Was Amanda dating anyone? I mean, did she have any friendships that were cause for concern?\nMISSUS WALSH: No, I was more concerned that she didn't have any friends. She didn't like school. She didn't want to do sports. It was ballet. That was the only thing that ever made her happy.\nPETER: Missus Walsh, how did your daughter die?\nMISSUS WALSH: She took her own life. My daughter was clinically depressed.\nOLIVIA: Was she being treated for depression?\nMISSUS WALSH: Yes. She was on antidepression medication. She also did a lot of group therapy. She kept trying different ones, but there were a few that she stuck with.\nOLIVIA: We'd like the names of the doctors and also the groups that she was attending.\nPETER: Excuse me for a sec. (takes EVO 4G video phone call outside)\nMISSUS WALSH: I'll get that information.\nPETER: (outside. looking at video call) Hey, Astrid.\nASTRID: Are you at the Walsh house?\nPETER: Yeah, why?\nASTRID: Well, Walter's got some theory. He needs you to speak to Missus Walsh.\nPETER: Okay. What's he need?\n(back inside the Walsh home)\nMISSUS WALSH: (hands-over information to Olivia as Peter returns) Amanda's schedule, her psychiatrist, the group she was going to. If there's anything else I can do...\nPETER: ...actually there is. That was Astrid on the phone. Missus Walsh, we'd like to ask your permission to exhume your daughter's body.\nMISSUS WALSH: You can't.\nPETER: I know that it's an awful thing to ask.\nMISSUS WALSH: No, it's -- it's not possible.\nPETER: (returns with a large urm) Walter.\nWALTER: Here she is.\nPETER: I hope there's a good reason for this, given all that family's already had to suffer.\nWALTER: There's a good reason.\nPETER: Oh, Walter, come on.\nASTRID: Oh, my god.\nPETER: That's a person.\nWALTER: No, not at all. I suspect it's some kind of hardwood, cherry, maybe mahogany, and concrete.\nPETER: Are you sure?\nWALTER: I know that these are not human cremains.\nASTRID: If that's not her, then where's her body?\nWALTER: Likely with the rest of her organs. I believe whoever is stealing these organs is trying to put this girl back together again.\nROLAND BARRETT: (carefully aligns the limp body of Amanda Walsh in the supports and pulleys that hang from the roof of his basement) It's gonna be good for you, very good. We need to keep your body strong, don't we?\n(he returns to a console of levers and starts a phonograph with a classical ballet tune. he activates the levers and foot pedal, then lifts the limp body of Amanda into various ballet position. he returns Amanda to her seated position and drops his head in sad remembrance)\nASTRID: (on the phone) So the funeral home didn't report it. You're kidding me. Okay, thanks. (hangs-up. to Walter) Broyles just confirmed your suspicion. Amanda Walsh's body was stolen before it could be cremated, and the funeral home covered it up. Apparently stealing bodies is not all that unusual.\nWALTER: Of course not. The theft of corpses is a time-honored tradition.\nASTRID: Tradition?\nWALTER: My Dear, we've been stealing from the dead for as long as we've been burying them. Perhaps longer. In the eighteen hundreds, grave robbery was the primary means that doctors and scientists had of obtaining human cadavers for study. In fact, the practice was so common that it inspired the gothic novel Frankenstein. You may have heard of it.\nASTRID: You don't really believe that it's possible to bring a dead person back to life, do you?\nWALTER: No, but not for lack of trying. Belly and I dabbled in that arena for years. But alas, we never could revive Yatsko. Peter just loved that cocker-spaniel. (testing the corpse) Feel that. Finally some stiffness.\nOLIVIA: (standing and reviewing the stacks of files) Okay, I've removed anyone who doesn't have a medical or a scientific background.\nPETER: (sitting across from her at the table and reviewing the files) What about this guy? Ellis Rourke.\nOLIVIA: What group was he in?\nPETER: Uh, General Depression. He and Amanda were in it together for almost a year.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Hit me.\nPETER: Age thirty-six, majored in biology, has an anger-management problem, arrested twice for battery.\nOLIVIA: No, whoever's doing this isn't driven by anger.\nFBI AGENT: (enters room with storage file) Colonel Broyles asked me to drop these records off. (leaves)\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you. I got it. Oh, Amanda was also in a cognitive behavioral group. It focused on ways to cope with depression.\nPETER: You'd think that someone who was working that hard at being okay would get some sort of payoff.\nOLIVIA: Well, it doesn't always work like that.\nPETER: I think I got something. Simon Waylan, age twenty-nine. Says here that he is socially and sexually incompetent.\nOLIVIA: (terse) No, it doesn't fit the profile.\nPETER: (reconciling) Alright, I - I appreciate that profiling is one of your specialties, but you could at least listen to what I have to say before you just dismiss it out-of-hand.\nOLIVIA: Well, he's not the guy we're looking for.\nPETER: So what am I missing?\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nPETER: You said that we're looking for somebody who knows Amanda -- a loner type who has difficulty making friends, who more than likely has parents who are either living far away, or are deceased, which would bring me to Simon Waylan. Twenty-nine years old, computer programmer, bachelor, lives alone, also just happened to leave the emergency-contact sheet blank. Therapist says that he displays symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, which means caring about other people is not exactly his strong suit.\nOLIVIA: Look, I'm sorry, but he's not the guy.\nPETER: Right. So why not?\nOLIVIA: Profiling is not just about checking off the facts. You have to weigh them. You got to feel it in your gut.\nPETER: So what don't you feel...\nOLIVIA: ...he doesn't love her. Whoever's out there fighting to give Amanda back her life, even though she chose to end it, loves her. Okay?\nPETER: Okay.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry.\nPETER: Don't be. Let's just move on.\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nPETER: Roland David Barrett... worked in animal research. But... it's not him. He dropped out of the group last Spring.\nOLIVIA: When last Spring?\nPETER: Last session was... April 10th... the day that Amanda committed suicide.\nPETER: (reading file) Barrett is the only son of Nathaniel Barrett, heir to the Stanfield Chemical fortune. Ten years ago, after his father passed away, Roland inherited everything. Does his post-doctoral work on cell decay and regeneration, but then quit abruptly because of an onset of severe depression. Then four years ago, he picks up his scientific work at the Duk-Hee Genetic Institute -- part of an international team. There are hundreds of different researchers working on it, but according to this, Barrett's research contributed to the creation of synthetic life on the cellular level. I wonder if he could actually do it.\nOLIVIA: (drives and thinks) What?\nPETER: Reanimation.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\n(Barrett places electrodes on Amanda after anatomical reconstruction. He turns the power up and hits her with a heavy jolt that makes her convulse. After only a few heartbeats she flatlines and a goes still. A few moments later, her heartbeat returns and she sits up - her eyes wildly searching the makeshift operating room in confusion)\nROLAND BARRETT: Amanda? Amanda, it's me. It -- it's me, Roland. You -- you made a terrible mistake. But it's okay now. You're back. I always told you I'm gonna be there for you, The way you were there for me, remember? It's okay. Hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at Roland. Look at me. Oh--oh, no.\nASSAULT TEAM: FBI! You're surrounded. All teams move out! Go! Go! Go! Move, move! Clear!\nTECHNICIAN: Go ahead and start a \"V\" series.\n(the team spreads out to search the house)\nOLIVIA: (after tackling Barrett) Where is she?\nROLAND BARRETT: Downstairs.\nBROYLES: (to the Bishops as they move downstairs) Clear.\nROLAND BARRETT: (confessing quietly to Olivia) I was trying to correct a wrong. She made a mistake.\nOLIVIA: What was your relationship to her?\nROLAND BARRETT: I just wanted her to have another chance. I wanted her to live a life. Her eyes. When I looked into her eyes... it wasn't Amanda. I don't know what I brought back, but I know... it -- it wasn't her.\nPETER: (after Walter starts to inspect Amanda) Is she dead?\nWALTER: Yes, she's dead.\n(as the forensics team starts to pack and leave Barrett's house)\nWALTER: You know what I need after a day like today?\nPETER: For most people, it would be a drink, so I'm guessing...\nWALTER: ...strawberry milkshake...\nPETER: I can do that.\nWALTER: With extra whipped cream.\nPETER: Don't push it.\nPETER: Olivia? Are you okay? What is it?\nOLIVIA: You know what Barrett said? He said that he looked into her eyes, and he knew that it wasn't her.\nPETER: Olivia...\nOLIVIA: (about Fauxlivia) I understand the facts. I know that she had reams of information about me and about my life and about the people that were close to me. And I understand that if she slipped up that she would have a completely reasonable explanation for it. And I guess to expect you to have seen past that is perhaps asking a little bit too much. But when I was over there, I thought about you. And you were just a figment of my imagination. But I held onto you, and it wasn't reasonable, and it wasn't logical, but I did it, so... why didn't you? She wasn't me. How could you not see that? Now she's everywhere. She's in my house, my job, my bed, and I don't want to wear my clothes anymore, and I don't want to live in my apartment, and I don't want to be with you. She's taken everything.\nPETER: (softly, after Olivia left) I'm sorry.\nTHE OBSERVER: (standing across the street as the Bishops enter the shop for a late night treat. calls out on his handheld communication device) I have arrived. (listens) Yes. I am looking at him as we speak. He is still... alive. (reporting on one of the two Bishop men)"

You're up early.\nPETER: Oh, no, I'm still asleep upstairs in my bed. You're just talking to an astral projection of me.\nWALTER: You're just saying that to see if I'm high.\nPETER: (looks at the syringe) What are you doing, Walter?\nWALTER: I'm making myself smarter.\nPETER: Really? (sits and prepares for the tale)\nWALTER: When William removed those parts of my brain all those years ago, he diminished my intellect. (swabbing his backside for the injection) And now, I'm not the equal of my equal.\nPETER: Your equal?\nWALTER: Walternate. If I can think like him, I can figure out what he's trying to do with that device and how to keep you safe.\nPETER: Walter. (interrupts the injection)\nWALTER: Hmm?\nPETER: You really sure you should be dabbling in that?\nWALTER: I've done hundreds of experiments on myself.\nPETER: No. That's not what I meant, Walter. (earnestly) According to William Bell, he took out those parts of your brain for a reason. Because you asked him to. Because you were afraid of what you were becoming... I don't want to see you hurt yourself.\nWALTER: I won't hurt myself. (injects the solution into his left backside) Ooh. Ahh...\nPETER: (hears knocking at the door) Who's that at two in the morning?\nWALTER: Oh! My pizza. (trundles to the door with his trousers around his ankles)\nPETER: So you are high, then.\nWALTER: Maybe a bit.\n(Boston late night, a lone retiree pads along an empty corridor. the staff notices on one of their security monitors)\nJOE: We've got a live one.\nPAM: (joins her colleague) That's Mister Joyce. He's a sleepwalker.\nJOE: (a security alert flashes nearby) Open door in the patient wing. (on the monitor, a younger man joins Joyce) Who is that?\nPAM: Come on. (both leave the security station to find Joyce) Mister Joyce, are you awake? Mister Joyce! Who were you talking to? That boy. Where did he go?\nROSCOE JOYCE: I was talking to... Bobby.\nPAM: Bobby? (back in Roscoe's room as she settles him in, to Joe) Now, he definitely wasn't talking to Bobby.\nJOE: Who's Bobby?\nPAM: (picks-up a framed photo of Roscoe and Bobby from decades ago) He's Mister Joyce's son. He died in 1985. (to Roscoe) What did he say to you?\n(the young man from the security footage climbs to meet the man who brought him to his father)\nOBSERVER: Did you tell him?\nBOBBY JOYCE: (nods yes) What now?\nOBSERVER: I take you back home.\n(responds to knocking at her door. looks through the peephole then opens the door)\nCOURIER: Olivia Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. (accepts a bulky envelope and signs for it) Thank you. (closes the door, inspects the envelope, opens it and extracts the book - \"If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!\". looks at the backcover. opens the book and finds a card with the message -- -- she puts the book down and answers her ringing cell phone) Dunham.\nPETER: (to Olivia as she enters the facility and joins the team) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey. What's up?\nPETER: Broyles was just telling us a ghost story.\nBROYLES: Bobby Joyce. (hands over a picture from the security footage showing Roscoe Joyce and his son) He's the son of one of the residents here. Or rather, he was. He died twenty-five years ago. And it gets more odd. The cameras picked up this as well. (hands Olivia another picture. one with Bobby and The Observer.)\nOLIVIA: The Observer? It's been a while since we've seen him.\nPAM: (summoning the team) Agent Broyles?\nPETER: (to his father, who is still studying the photograph of The Observer) You coming Walter?\nWALTER: Yes, of course.\nPAM: (leads the team through the day room) After I took a second look at the video, I knew who it was right away. Mister Joyce keeps a photo of Bobby on his bedside table. I been looking at it ever since I worked here.\nPETER: Did Mister Joyce say what it was that he and Bobby were talking about?\nPAM: (enters the TV room) He doesn't remember. He was sleepwalking. (points to the seated man) That's Mister Joyce.\nWALTER: Roscoe Joyce!\nBROYLES: You know him?\nWALTER: (hurries to his side) Mister Joyce! Mister... Mister Joyce. I'm Walter Bishop! (star struck, he reaches to shake hands) I'm a tremendous fan!\nROSCOE JOYCE: (understated) Nice to meet you.\nPETER: (privately) You ever heard of Violet Sedan Chair?\nBROYLES: No.\nPETER: It's Walter's favorite band. Roscoe Joyce is their keyboardist. He's a hero of Walter's. He's up there with Einstein and Tesla.\nOLIVIA: Uh... Mister Joyce, I'm Agent Olivia Dunham. (shakes hands) Hi. I understand that you had a visitor last night.\nROSCOE JOYCE: My son. (shows her his framed photograph) I don't remember talking to him. But I remember he was here. It's a curse, not... remembering a miracle. It was a miracle -- seeing him again. Can you imagine what that's like?\nWALTER: Yes, I can.\nOLIVIA: (pauses) Mister Joyce?\nNURSE #1: I'm sorry. It's time for his physical therapy and his medication.\nPAM: Ready, Mister Joyce? (the two help him stand up) One, two... three. (they lead him away)\nBROYLES: I've come to believe in some strange things, but ghosts...\nWALTER. Bobby wasn't a ghost. The Observer doesn't experience time like we do. If we can accept that he can travel from the past to the present and back to the past again, then it's not inconceivable that he could bring others with him. We'll have to try and help Mister Joyce remember what his son said to him. I'll need to take him back to my lab.\nPETER: But why would The Observer drag a dead man twenty-five years through time just to talk with his father?\nWALTER: I don't know. But every time The Observer shows up, it has something to do with you. And every time, it's something bad.\nPETER: Walter, come on, you--\nWALTER: I'll go wait in the car. (walks away)\nBROYLES: I'll make the arrangements to have Mister Joyce released.\nPAM: (after the arrangements have been made) Three pills at eight this evening, and he gets a little cranky if he doesn't eat.\nPETER: That's alright, I got experience with cranky. Thank you. (puts the bottle of pills in his pocket and joins Olivia nearby)\nPAM: Mm-hmm. Have a good one.\nPETER: (noticing an adorable senior couple sitting and chatting) That's sweet.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, it is. (reaches inside her coat and returns the book Peter sent to her apartment) Uh, I don't think that this was for me. It arrived this morning, and I looked at the date on the order, and it was from when I was over there, so I figured that it was probably for her.\nPETER: (tongue-tied) Olivia...\nOLIVIA: ...It's okay.\nROSCOE JOYCE: (joins the duo with Walter) I understand you're gonna help me remember what my son said to me.\nOLIVIA: We're gonna try.\nROBBER #1: (loading money from the vault to a gym bag) I'm almost done here. You guys finished out front? (turns and sees The Observer behind him. reaches for his pistol before being tossed through a large interior window)\nOBSERVER: (incapacitates a second gun-toting 'tattoo man', then catches several bullets as the third 'tough man' fires his weapon. a punch and a kick later his objective is achieved. he dials on his communications device and reports) I'm at 719 Skelton Avenue. There has been a robbery. (as he walks from the scene he hears pained wheezing from the employee that has been bound by the robbers. he stops and removes the tape from her mouth)\nVICTORIA DIMIRO: Help me. (her savior searches her purse and gives her a blast from her inhaler. after her breathing calms) Thank you.\n(The Observer exits the store, puts the inhaler in his pocket and quietly walks off)\nPETER: (escorting a piano into the lab) Walter? Where do you want this?\nWALTER: Uh, r-r-right...there! (points)\nPETER: (to the delivery team) Very good. Thanks, fellas. (to Walter, about Roscoe) What's he listening to?\nWALTER: Ocean waves. I need him to be in a peaceful state of mind for the hypnotherapy to take full effect. Once he's in a more pliable state, he may be able to access his memories. (dons his blue\/red lensed glasses)\nASTRID: (sarcastic) That's a good look, Walter.\nWALTER: These were created by an old friend of mine, Doctor Jacoby from Washington State. They will enable me to see Roscoe's aura so that I can measure the depth of his hypnotic state.\nASTRID: And the piano?\nWALTER: Roscoe's mind doesn't work like ours. His creativity is expressed through music. Playing -- may help him to recollect the conversation he had with his son.\nPETER: And if you just happen to get a private concert from your musical idol...\nWALTER: That's not why I'm doing this. But I cannot deny that I would enjoy it. (getting the attention of his lethargic subject) Mister Joyce? We're ready for you.\nROSCOE JOYCE: (lifts his headphone from his ear) What do you want me to do?\nWALTER: Let me guide you. Listen to my voice. I will speak into the microphone. Now, imagine yourself... somewhere tranquil, serene, safe. Go down the staircase...\nOLIVIA: (on the phone, while Peter picks up a bag and joins her) So there's no footage at all? Okay, well, thank you for checking. (hangs-up. to Peter) I thought maybe the traffic cameras would have picked up The Observer, but no such luck. How's it going out there?\nPETER: (removes the book from the bag) Uh, Walter's channeling The Amazing Kreskin. I just wanted to try and explain the book.\nOLIVIA: You don't have to.\nPETER: She asked me what my favorite book was. I understand that she was probably just trying to gather information on me, but... I also know that I'm not the easiest guy to get to know. (heart-felt) It's always been easier for me to... keep people at arm's length... which is actually something that I think we have in common. The book wasn't meant for her. It was meant for the Olivia Dunham that I've spent the last couple years of my life with. Because I wanted you to read it. You're the person I wanted to share it with.\nOLIVIA: (saddened) You know, I feel like Rip Van Winkle. Everything is different. Even you opening up to me is different. And this book is just a reminder of all the things that I missed, conversations we didn't have...\nASTRID: (joins them in the inner office) You guys should come see this. Walter's doing it.\nWALTER: (to Roscoe) Sit. At the count of three, you will open your eyes, but you won't be awake. You'll still be open and receptive as you are now. Are you ready? One... Two, three.\nROSCOE JOYCE: (sitting at the keyboard) Ohh... ha ha. It's been a long time since I touched a piano. (steps on the footpedal twice. starts playing the piano)\nWALTER: Roscoe, I want you to think back. The night you saw Bobby.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Tuesday... Tuesday is... chicken dinner.\nWALTER: Yes. And... after you went to bed and fell asleep, what happened?\nROSCOE JOYCE: (methodical) Bobby... my boy. I didn't believe it was him. It'd been so long since... I'd seen him. I asked him if he was real. He took my hand... he was real.\nWALTER: What did he say?\nROSCOE JOYCE: He whispered something to me. He was so close... I felt his... (ringing cell phone interrupts his thoughts)\nOLIVIA: God. I \u2013 I - I'm \u2014 (on phone) Dunham. Can you hold on, please? (to Walter) I - I'm so sorry, Walter. (walks off. to her caller) This is Dunham.\nWALTER: Let's go. What did Bobby say?\nROSCOE JOYCE: I don't remember.\nOLIVIA: (on phone) Go it. I'm on my way. (hangs-up. to Peter) The Observer's been spotted in Brookline, so...\nPETER: Walter, you alright?\nWALTER: If alright means despondent, yes.\nASTRID: Peter, go. I'll take care of him.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I'm sorry!\nROSCOE JOYCE: He was in a... brown shirt.\nASTRID: Who was?\nROSCOE JOYCE: Bobby. His mother gave it to him.\nWALTER: What did Bobby tell you?\nROSCOE JOYCE: He told me... I would... meet you. Walter... Bishop. He called you by name. Bobby said I was supposed to... help you.\nWALTER: Help me. How?\nROSCOE JOYCE: I don't know. Don't you?\nTHE OBSERVER: (as his colleague joins him) It has begun. I have set everything in motion.\nDECEMBER: I have watched Doctor Bishop as long as you have, perhaps not as closely, but I think you're wrong. He won't do it.\nTHE OBSERVER: I disagree. I believe he has changed. (both watch a man exit and lock his pick-up truck)\nDECEMBER: You think he has changed. I don't believe he has. In either case, I suppose we will find out soon enough.\n(The Observer approaches the truck, touches the locked keyhole once, opens the door and steals the vehicle)\nROSCOE JOYCE: (setting at the piano and playing casually) Are you sure you don't know what I'm supposed to do for ya?\nWALTER: (working nearby at a table with burners, beakers and tubes) No idea.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Bobby told me to help you.\nWALTER: You already have. Just hearing you play, I... (a youthful smile finds his face) I feel like I'm a teenager again. Can I ask you something, Roscoe? Why did Violet Sedan Chair break up?\nROSCOE JOYCE: (stops playing) I don't know. It just happened. We were having creative differences. We figured the best thing to do was to take a break, give the band time to regroup. One day, I looked up... and a couple of years had gone by. I barely touched the keyboard. And then a couple of more. Eventually... it just seemed easier not to. (starts playing) I suppose that that's hard to understand.\nWALTER: No. I spent years away from the things I loved. (heavy memories flood in) I've been trying to get back into the swing of it ever since.\nVICTORIA DIMIRO: I was having an asthma attack. It was like he saw what I needed. He got my inhaler from my purse.\nPETER: Did he say anything to you? (Olivia sits and listens quietly for the response)\nVICTORIA DIMIRO: No. Nothing. It was like nothing affected him. He had this calmness. I didn't even think he was real, except... he saved my life.\nROSCOE JOYCE: So... what -- what is all this you got here, huh? (referring to the elaborate equipment surrounding them)\nWALTER: Recently, I invented a liquid base to aid in the process of brain-mapping.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Ha. Really? Brain-mapping. That's a good name for an album. (watches as Walter pours a vial of liquid into a container of milk) Any chance you could explain that to a simpleton like me?\nWALTER: (approaches the piano) I don't want to bore you with the details, but I'm missing parts of my brain. And I have to rejuvenate them in order to rise to the intellectual challenges before me.\nROSCOE JOYCE: And they are?\nWALTER: Discovering why your son Bobby left the message... and how to keep my son Peter from the peril surrounding him.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Is that... milk? (points at the container)\nWALTER: The milk acts as a bonding agent for the other compounds.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Oh...\nWALTER: (places the container of modified milk in the refrigerator) a... and helps disguise the taste.\nROSCOE JOYCE: I don't see how I can help you in any way. My knowledge of science begins and ends with inventing a recipe for a... strawberry milk shake.\nWALTER: You like strawberry milk shake?\nROSCOE JOYCE: They're my number one drink since I stopped drinking.\nWALTER: It's mine too! Ashram! Come out here, please.\nASTRID: Walter, what is it?\nWALTER: I need you to go to the grocery store.\nASTRID: Walter...\nWALTER: We need a gallon of strawberry ice cream, some sweet whey, and some yeast and some sugar.\nASTRID: Okay. We need coffee anyway. (leaves the lab)\nWALTER: Thank you, Dear. (to Roscoe) I spent six years perfecting my recipe. You must try it! Well... ha. (toasting) To answers. (hears door open and close) Oh, did you forget something? I hope they didn't run out of sweet whey. (turns to find that Astrid has not come back into the lab)\nOBSERVER: Hello, Walter. We need to speak.\n(walking through one of the many campus green areas, Walter's acquaintance gets the conversation he asked for)\nOBSERVER: (looking at the changing, falling leaves) You call it... Autumn. Is that right? Lovely word.\nWALTER: We had a deal. (takes the man by his arm) Please... don't take him from me. The drawing. Peter in the device. You know the future. Tell me how I can save my son from dying.\nOBSERVER: There are things that I know. But there are things that I do not. Various possible futures are happening simultaneously. I can tell you all of them, but I cannot tell you which one of them will come to pass. Because every action causes ripples, consequences both obvious and... unforeseen. For instance... after I pulled you and Peter from the icy lake, later that summer, Peter caught a firefly. I could not have known he would do that or that because he did a young girl three miles away would not. And so later that night, she would continue looking, trying to find another one. I could not have known that when she did not come home, her father would go out looking for her, driving in the rain, so that when the traffic light turned red, his truck skidded through the intersection at Harvard Yard, killing a pedestrian.\nWALTER: Did that happen?\nOBSERVER: You and I have interfered with the natural course of events. We have upset the balance in ways I could not have predicted. Which is why now I need your help.\nWALTER: (surprised) Help?\nOBSERVER: When the time comes, give him the keys and save the girl.\nWALTER: Give him the keys? W - wha -- what do you mean? What girl?\nOBSERVER: You should answer your phone.\nWALTER: (answers his phone just as it starts to ring. turns away for some privacy) Hello?\nPETER: (over the phone) Apparently, your friend is fighting crimes now.\nWALTER: Friend? (turns and sees that he is suddenly alone)\nPETER: The Observer. Broke up a robbery at a jewelry store. Three guys came in, killed the owner, tied up the girl who worked here.\nWALTER: Girl?\nPETER: Yeah, according to her, The Observer saved her life.\nWALTER: Who is she, the girl?\nPETER: Her name's Victoria Dimiro. Why?\nWALTER: I - I - I need to speak to her. Bring her here.\nPETER: Walter...\nWALTER: ... please don't argue with me, Peter. This is important. I need to speak with her.\nPETER: (looks back into the store to see that the interview is on-going) Fine. But you'll have to wait. Cops are about to take her downtown so she can give a statement.\nWALTER: Well, as soon as they're done, bring her here to me. (hangs-up)\nROSCOE JOYCE: (sitting and eating a big bowl of ice cream as Walter returns from his stroll) Ah! There you are. I have several things to tell you. First... Miss Farnsworth is back. And, uh, and I... remember something else.\nWALTER: Oh?\nROSCOE JOYCE: Bobby... called me on the phone.\nWALTER: (baffled) Just now?\nROSCOE JOYCE: Oh, no, no. Ha ha. No. Years ago. We were on tour, and he called to tell me about a strange dream he'd just had. He dreamt a bald man in a dark suit, took him to see me. I was an old man living in a nursing home. Dreaming about something that happens... twenty-five years later.\nWALTER: I don't think it was a dream at all. I think... the man in the suit took your son through time. And it was only just last night that you caught up to the other end of the visit.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Mm. Wild. (chuckles, not sure of implication) You know, come to think of it, that was the last conversation we had. Him... telling me about his dream. We were playing a show that night, a club in Harvard Yard. Bobby... was on his way to the show. I remember looking outside and seeing how hard it was raining. I remember getting a call from the police. They told me... he stepped onto the crosswalk... when a truck...\nWALTER: ...skidded through the traffic light.\nROSCOE JOYCE: They said it was -- wasn't anybody's fault. (growing tearful) When I lost my son... nothing seemed to matter anymore. That's the reason I broke up the band. But here I am. I played again. It felt good. It felt right. Maybe that's why Bobby came back.\nWALTER: (resolved) Maybe it was. Would you excuse me for a moment? (walks to one of the offices in the lab)\nASTRID: Hey. Peter called. He wanted me to let you know that they are on their way back, and they're bringing the salesgirl with them. (sees his concern) Walter, what is it?\nWALTER: I know what The Observer's doing.\nASTRID: (tentatively) Okay.\nWALTER: The day I crossed over and saved Peter, I set off a chain reaction. I set the universe off-balance. Two of them. I've seen the damage with my own eyes, but... it's not enough. It - it's not enough to understand the suffering I've caused.\nASTRID: (quickly interjecting) Walter, we have been over this. You couldn't have known.\nWALTER: That's exactly the point -- unforeseen consequences. But my fault, just the same. (looks through the blinds into the lab) And that man... has lost a son because I was unwilling to lose mine. I know the Observer is trying to restore balance, and he wants me to help him, to -- to help undo all the damage I've caused, but I can't do it. Don't you see? Doing that, I would lose him all over again.\nASTRID: Lose who?\nWALTER: Peter!\nASTRID: Walter--\nWALTER: I need a phone! (hurries off)\nPETER: (answers ringing cell phone as Olivia drives behind the police cruiser delivering Ms DiMiro) Hello.\nWALTER: (over the phone. from the lab) A - ask that salesgirl a question for me. Where was she in 1985?\nPETER: I can't do that, Walter. She's in the car in front of us. But we're just passing through Porter Square. We should be there in about five minutes. You can ask her all the questions you like then --\n(the vehicle stolen by The Observer speeds along a perpendicular thoroughfare and collides into the side of the police cruiser. Olivia swerves and skids, flattening a tire in the process. traffic grinds to a halt)\nWALTER: (loudly. concerned at what he just heard) Peter?\n(Olivia and Peter exit their vehicle to tend to the wreck. The Observer sets off on foot)\nWALTER: (on the phone from the lab) Peter? Peter, what is it?\nOLIVIA: (barks an order at Peter) You check the other car. I'll go after him.\nWALTER: Peter, what's happening?\nPETER: (on phone) The Observer ran into the cop car.\nWALTER: Peter, are you alright?\nPETER: (looks at Victoria, then to the injured policeman that was driving) Get on the dispatch. We're gonna need an ambulance.\nWALTER: Peter!\nPETER: I gotta go! I got to go! (to Victoria) Where's your, uh, your inhaler? (searches her purse) No. It's not in there.\nVICTORIA DIMIRO: The bald man in the store... he took it.\nPETER: Put your arms around my neck. (carries her from the wrecked police cruiser)\nOLIVIA: (running down a nearby street) Excuse me! FBI! Move!\nPETER: Try to calm down. You're gonna be alright. (placing her in the rear hatch section of his vehicle)\nWALTER: (arrives in his station at the collision scene) Peter, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, but she's not. (waves him over to help)\nASTRID: What's wrong with her?\nPETER: She's asthmatic. The adrenaline from the crash...\nWALTER: ...elevated her heart rate and triggered an attack.\nPETER: Exactly. There's an ambulance on the way, okay?\nWALTER: Where are you going?\nPETER: Olivia took off after The Observer on foot. I'm gonna catch up. Hey, give the keys and save the girl. (puts out a hand for the keys the station wagon)\nWALTER: What did you say?\nPETER: I said give me the keys and save the girl.\nWALTER: (confounded) He told me you'd say that.\nPETER: Who?\nWALTER: The Observer. This is it! This is his plan. This is what he wanted.\nPETER: You spoke with The Observer?\nWALTER: Yes! He is course correcting. (gets it. understands the master plan) I don't know how, but he's done some kind of... a chain reaction that started from the moment that we walked into that nursing home to meet Roscoe. Everything since has been the sequence culminating in this very moment, and if I save this woman and let you go, then I'm afraid the consequences... you're gonna die, Peter. They're gonna take you from me.\nPETER: Walter, you can't predict the future, and neither can I. But if you don't help that girl right now, she's gonna die in the street -- do you hear me?\nWALTER: They'll take you from me.\nPETER: (reassuring) Walter, give me the keys. Give me the keys, Walter.\nOLIVIA: (continuing on foot through the pedestrian traffic) Excuse me! Out of my way! Move! FBI! Coming through! Excuse me! (stops. calls on her phone)\nPETER: (on his phone) Yeah.\nOLIVIA: I'm on State Street. I've lost him.\nPETER: I got him. He's headed into a hostel at 2119 Main Street.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I'm on my way.\nPETER: (exits the station wagon and is nearly struck by traffic) Hey! (is nearly struck again and continues pursuit on foot)\nASTRID: Walter, she's getting worse!\nWALTER: (after searching for any makeshift equipment to help his patient) Now, here, I - I want you to lay down, please, so we can help you -- lay down. Astrid, would you put your hands either side of her ribs, please?\nVICTORIA DIMIRO: (wheezing. to Astrid) It's alright.\nWALTER: When I tell you, I want you to push up, applying constant pressure.\nASTRID: Okay.\nWALTER: I am going to use this plastic bottle to push air into your lungs. Will you hold your nose, please? (she does) Okay, good. Are you ready? (to Astrid) Push.\n(nearby. Peter finds his man on a separate rooftop residential complex than the one he climbed-up)\nPETER: What is this all about? You know, don't you? The picture of me and the device -- what does it mean? What's going to happen to me?\nOBSERVER: It must be very difficult.\nPETER: What?\nOBSERVER: Being a father. (then fires his pulse gun, knocking down Peter)\nPETER: Unh!\nOLIVIA: (catches the tail end of the action and leaps the alleyway to the second roof to follow) Hey! (draws her weapon, sees that she has fallen well behind, and that Peter is starting to wake up)\nWALTER: (to the EMTs that are loading Victoria in the ambulance) You need to keep her calm to prevent another attack.\nVICTORIA DIMIRO: Thank you.\nWALTER: (answers ringing cell phone) H - hello?\nOLIVIA: (from the scene of the confrontation) Walter, we lost him.\nWALTER: Peter?\nOLIVIA: No, Walter, The Observer. Peter's fine. He's just a bit banged up, that's all. Why would you think we lost Peter?\nASTRID: Is Peter okay?\nWALTER: Yes. It doesn't make sense. Why would The Observer do all this?\nROSCOE JOYCE: (walks into his room feeling renewed) Ah... home. It was a pleasure to meet you, Kelly.\nASTRID: (smiling) You too, Roscoe.\nWALTER: I don't know what to say.\nROSCOE JOYCE: Come visit me sometime. Bring me a strawberry milk shake. I'll play some piano for ya.\nWALTER: (shakes hands with a tearful smile) It would be an honor.\nROSCOE JOYCE: (shares a nice man hug with his new friend) I forgot what my son felt like, what he smelled like. How it felt to be around him. But now I remember. Nobody is supposed to have a second chance like that.\n(the duo walks in from the corridor outside the lab)\nPETER: First he saves the girl, then he tries to kill her. Then he runs up five flights of stairs just to shoot me with his magic air gun and disappear. None of it makes any sense.\nOLIVIA: (smart-alecky) And how is this different to any other day?\nPETER: Uh...\nOLIVIA: Peter, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?\nPETER: No, I'm okay. Thanks. (she finds the book that he had sent to her apartment) Do you ever feel like every time we get close to getting the answers, somebody changes the question? (swoons) Olivia.\nOLIVIA: So why is this your favorite book?\nPETER: (struggles) Because it talks about not depending on other people for answers. That you can only find the answers inside yourself. Which... given our current situation, is kind of amusing if you think about it. (takes a pill and washes it down with Walter's modified milk) Oh...unh! (drops the container and collapses)\nOLIVIA: Peter? Peter!\nWALTER: (at Parklane Senior Care. answers ringing cell phone) Hello. Walter Bishop.\nOLIVIA: Walter, Peter's collapsed. He's having some kind of a seizure. He took some aspirins and swallowed it with some milk --\nWALTER: Milk?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, from the refrigerator.\nWALTER: Oh, gawd!\nOLIVIA: Oh, gawd what?\nWALTER: The organometals I - in the serum must have reacted with, with the phosphates in the milk.\nOLIVIA: (urgently) Walter, what do I do?\nWALTER: (over the phone loudspeaker) He needs an anticoagulant to stop the seizures. In my medical bag on the shelf near the centrifuge.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I got it--\nWALTER: ...You'll also need the gallon jug of saline, which is on the bottom shelf. Open the bag -- you'll find a bottle of magnesium sulfate. Use the syringe. One c.c. of magnesium sulfate, nine c.c's o-of saline.\nOLIVIA: It's not here, Walter, the magnesium sulfate. I can't find it.\nWALTER: Oh, w--no, no, no, I moved it, so... So I - I'd know where I put it. It was such an obvious place--\nOLIVIA: Please, Walter!\nWALTER: Oh! Yeah! I - I alphabetized it. I - it's in the refrigerator next to the mayonnaise.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I got it.\nWALTER: Quickly --\nOLIVIA: (prepares a syringe of Walter's solution) Okay, Walter. Where do I put it?\nWALTER: In his leg. In his right leg. (waits) Olivia? Please tell me what's happening. Olivia?\nOLIVIA: Okay. Okay, I think he's stabilizing. Everything's okay.\nPHONOGRAPH MUSIC: I could while away the hours - conferrin' with the flowers - consultin' with the rain - and my head I'd be scratchin' - while my thoughts were busy hatchin'... if I only had a brain\nPETER: (waking up) Hey.\nWALTER: (presents a bowl of his soup) I made you some... Rosemary Chicken Soup. How are you feeling, son?\nPETER: (groggy) I'm better.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nPETER: (less groggy) What are you thanking me for?\nWALTER: For what you did. My serum was flawed. It would have killed me if I'd taken it. You only lived 'cause you're young and healthy. And I suspect... that's what this was all about.\nPETER: (doesn't have a clue) You lost me, Walter.\nWALTER: I think... The Observer saved my life. When he gave you a knock on the head so you'd take some aspirin and wash it down with the milk so you'd ingest the serum instead of me.\nPETER: (snarky-ish) I think if that's all he wanted, there must have been an easier way.\nWALTER: Well, he's not human. You can't expect him to think like us. (hands over hot bowl) Oh!\nPETER: (accepts bowl of soup) Thank you.\nPHONOGRAPH MUSIC: (slow and haunting as Walter thinks) ... and then I'd sit and think some more - I would not be just a nothin' - my head all full of stuffin' - my heart all full of pain...\n(outside the home in the cold, brisk night)\nOBSERVER: (mechanically with no emotion) I must admit, I feared my experiment would fail.\nDECEMBER: But you were right. He's changed. He was willing to let his son die.\nOBSERVER: Yes. And now we know. When the time comes... he will be willing to do it again."

(to Broyles after he rolls down his window)\nWALTER: (rolls down his window and politely asks the second sentry) Do you have any chewing gum?\nPFC TOMFORDE: (baffled) Excuse me?\nPETER: (interceding) I'm sorry. He's got this thing with his ears.\nWALTER: It's not a thing with my ears. I've got a blocked Eustachian tube. And it's a perfectly natural reaction. Any flavor will do, although I'm rather partial to grape.\nLIEUTENANT PIKE: Welcome back, Colonel Broyles. (salutes smartly)\n(inside a large hangar on the grounds: scientists, technicians and facilitators pour over databases and design schematics)\nJAMES FALCON: We've tried a dozen different power sources.\nNINA: (looks at a page with a drawing of the Wave Sink device) And there were no reactions at all?\nJAMES FALCON: We've run all the diagnostics. The machine continues to be unresponsive.\nAIDE: (approaches) Miss Sharp, your guests are here.\nNINA: Expand the telemetry parameters and run the tests again.\n(Nina finds the Fringe Team and walks them back to the hangar through the break area)\nNINA: I understand you broke the encryption on the computer the other Olivia left behind.\nBROYLES: A few days ago. Peter gave us a number of password suggestions. One worked.\nNINA: Oh?\nWALTER: Yeah. It was a song lyric. And Fauxlivia ruined U2 for all of us.\nNINA: Fauxlivia?\nPETER: That's what Walter's calling her now. 'Fauxlivia' as in \"fake Olivia.\"\nNINA: Ah. Uh, the data on the computer. What did you find?\nBROYLES: Unfortunately, it's one big file, mission details buried in hundreds of pages of mundane observations about our world. We don't know what's valuable and what isn't. And we can't identify any type of code.\nWALTER: (enters the hangar bay) Oh, my.\nOLIVIA: It's bigger than I imagined. (the team stands in awe, staring)\nPETER: Well, I suppose... it's just big enough to destroy a couple of universes.\nJAMES FALCON: (briefs the team as they approach the bank of technicians and scientists at their monitors) So far, we haven't been able to figure out how the machine works. NASA, the CIA, the NIH. We've had the government's top people at our disposal.\nWALTER: Which are you?\nJAMES FALCON: Excuse me?\nWALTER: Which agency do you work for?\nNINA: Walter, this is Doctor James Falcon, our lead scientist on this project.\nWALTER: Oh. Well, I suppose that makes me your boss. I am Doctor Walter Bishop. (shakes hands) Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.\nJAMES FALCON: As I was saying, we're confounded. There doesn't seem to be an energy source and nothing that suggests the machine can hold or transmit any type of power.\nDOCTOR GRANT: (typing at a nearby console. surrounding monitors start to fluctuate and degauss) Jack, are you getting this?\nJACK: Yeah.\nDOCTOR GRANT: Some kind of electromagnetic spike. (metallic objects start to tip over and slide around)\nNINA: Well, we think the problem must be the missing piece. The one that the other Olivia stole.\nPETER: That could be right. (referring to the blueprint on the table) The piece was right from the center of the machine. So it could be the power source.\nJAMES FALCON: Did the other Olivia mention the machine in her files?\nBROYLES: We're still working through the data. (interrupted by the screeching. portions of the device start to move and slide into a new configuration. Peter wipes his bleeding nose. everyone in the room looks on as the disruption ends)\nWALTER: Oh God.\nJAMES FALCON: It's like... something triggered it.\nPETER: Something did trigger it. Me.\n(late at night, the front door opens slowly and Peter slips into the house wearing dark clothes, dark gloves and carrying a large tote bag. he puts the bag down and heads to the refrigerator for a snack. he sits to prepare a sandwich)\nWALTER: (walks to the kitchen in his pajamas and robe... holding a book) Peter. You've been out?\nPETER: No, I just came downstairs. I couldn't sleep.\nWALTER: I thought I heard the door.\nPETER: (shrugs) You must have been dreaming.\nWALTER: I don't think so. I wasn't sleeping either. Is that peanut butter? Can I have one?\nPETER: Mm-hmm.\nWALTER: How you feeling? Any more nosebleed?\nPETER: No.\nWALTER: Headaches?\nPETER: No.\nWALTER: But you're unable to sleep?\nPETER: Yes, but I don't think that has anything to do with the machine, Walter.\nWALTER: Might. We don't know yet. We don't know anything. (places the book on the counter) The First People's book. I read it cover to cover a dozen times. There's nothing to suggest how that device works or how it's connected to you.\nPETER: Walter. Stop, please. I want answers too. And I know you want to help me, but I don't think that you can this time. You can't protect me from everything. (hands over the first sandwich)\nJAMES FALCON: (attaching electrodes as he prepares Peter for testing in a large scanning device) Only a couple more, Mister Bishop.\nWALTER: (vehement) You still haven't convinced me that this is necessary.\nJAMES FALCON: Every human being gives off a unique electromagnetic signature. We're testing to see if it was indeed your son's that triggered the machine.\nWALTER: I have a graduate degree from MIT as well. I don't need a test to know how unlikely it is that this has got anything to do with electromagnetics.\nNINA: Now Walter.\nWALTER: Peter. Do you have any idea how much radiation you're about to be exposed to?\nPETER: (lays calmly. with some sarcasm) Well, I do now, Walter.\nNINA: Walter, I think you're overreacting.\nWALTER: (to Nina) May I have a word in private, please?\nNINA: (inside the adjacent observation room) We can't fire him, Walter. He's one of the most gifted biomedical engineers in the country.\nWALTER: I don't care who he is. (emphatic) I don't want him poking and prodding my son.\nNINA: I know you're worried about Peter.\nWALTER: (angrily) I'm not worried, Nina. I'm terrified. Did you see the way that machine reacted to him?\nNINA: (calming. certain) That is precisely why we're running these tests.\nWALTER: This is a waste of time. It's not going to tell us anything. Nina, I need you to do something for me. I've been trying to regenerate my brain cells. But William was too clever for that. He not only took out pieces of my brain, he inhibited their ability to replicate.\nNINA: ...no Walter\nWALTER: -- but Belly kept detailed notes of everything he did. I want to see his research to know how to reverse what he did to me. To regrow my brain cells.\nNINA: Walter, that's more than fifteen years ago.\nWALTER: I'm not whole, Nina. If I'm to figure out how Peter is connected to the machine, I have to get smarter. (plea) It's the only way I'll be able to help my son.\nNINA: Yes. I'll get on it right away.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (approaches Peter as he is prepped) Hey.\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: You okay?\nPETER: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm great. (jesting) In fact, I think I might use my newfound superpowers to make this machine levitate.\nOLIVIA: Oh, well, now that would be impressive. (curious) Listen, I tried to call you last night and you didn't pick up.\nPETER: Oh. Yeah. (rolls eyes) Walter was being Walter. I had to go for a walk.\nJAMES FALCON: We're ready. Do you want something to help you to sleep? This may take a while.\nPETER: No. I'm okay. Thanks.\nJAMES FALCON: Peter, relax. This procedure's perfectly safe.\nPETER: I'm sorry, Doc. You'll forgive me if I'm a little bit leery of machines right about now.\nJAMES FALCON: I understand.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, I'm going to be right outside. (steps away with Falcon as Peter is slid into the scanner)\n(midday in the courtyard between several large government buildings. a man takes a cigarette break near the Koi Pond filled with leafy aquatic plants. he notices something strange in the fountain, removes the cigarette from his mouth, grabs a twig from the ground and moves the floating vegetation aside. curious about the dead fish, he finds a man floating face-up at the bottom of the shallow pond)\nBROYLES: (enters the lab while Astrid is cleaning the aquarium) I see Doctor Bishop leaves the high intensity work for you.\nASTRID: Agent Broyles. You know they're all over at Massive Dynamic.\nBROYLES: I know. I came to speak with you. For the past two days, an encryption team has been waiting for the data on the other Olivia's hard drive.\nASTRID: Yeah. I hear it's one big mess.\nBROYLES: More than three hundred pages of material. Details about this world. Profiles on our people. Mission specifics. It's difficult to know what information's important.\nASTRID: Well, I'm happy to help.\nBROYLES: I knew you would be. And we certainly could use your skills. But there's a reason I haven't already asked. Her mission logs are filled with personal observations. And many of them concern her relationship with Peter. And given what Peter and our Olivia have been through--\nASTRID: I understand. I'll be discreet.\nBROYLES: The file is on the mainframe. (hands her a card, then answers his ringing cellphone) Broyles. (listens) I'll be right there.\nJAMES FALCON: (studying the monitor in the Observation Room) Yes. I admit his rate is a bit high.\nWALTER: A hundred and thirty beats per minute is hardly a bit high. I want you to take him out of that machine right now.\nJAMES FALCON: Doctor Bishop, it's a very narrow tachycardia. It's hardly life-threatening. It would be ridiculous to stop testing for this.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so what is going on?\nJAMES FALCON: Peter's heart rate is a bit elevated. I assumed it was nerves at first, but he should've stabilized by now.\nOLIVIA: Are you saying that his heart rate could have triggered the machine?\nJAMES FALCON: No, I don't see how it could have. But it is curious and implies we should do more tests.\nWALTER: (angered) By all means. Let's use my son as a new Massive Dynamic lab rat!\nOLIVIA: Walter, I don't think the doctor was -- (answers ringing cellphone) Dunham. (listens) I'm on my way. (to Walter) Okay. I've got to go. Can you call me if you learn something new?\nBROYLES: (strolling along the edge of the pond as the forensics personnel investigate the area) His name was Michael Baird. He was found dead in the fountain by a colleague. M.E. thinks he was murdered some time around three A.M.\nOLIVIA: So what's with the dead fish?\nBROYLES: They died of mercury poisoning.\nOLIVIA: Mercury? (looks at Baird's body) He's a shapeshifter.\nBROYLES: That's not all. (to a forensics technician) Turn him over, please. (to Olivia about the large incision in Baird's lower back) His data storage disk was removed. (to the technician) Thank you. (to Olivia) Whoever did this knew what they were doing. So why would someone kill a shapeshifter?\nOLIVIA: You mean someone other than us? Okay. (postulating) What if this was Walternate? What if he sent over some type of cleaner to tie up all the loose ends? To kill this guy before we...\nBROYLES: ... before we learned what he knew.\nOLIVIA: What are you thinking?\nASTRID: (in the lab. answers her ringing cell phone) This is Astrid.\nBROYLES: Agent Farnsworth. I need you to run a search on the other Olivia's data file.\nASTRID: Okay. What's the name?\nBROYLES: Michael Baird.\nASTRID: (types in the request) Yeah, he's on here. He's on a long list of Port Authority employees.\nBROYLES: Shut down the mainframe. Shut it down now. And from this moment on, no one accesses that file except you.\nOLIVIA: (after the phone call is completed) What's going on?\nBROYLES: We cracked the encryption on the other Olivia's hard drive thirty-six hours ago. Among the info, she lists thousands of names. Michael Baird is one of them. Suppose Walternate knew we were getting close to identifying the list of shapeshifters on that drive.\nOLIVIA: How would he know that?\nBROYLES: Because someone on our side may have told him.\nOLIVIA: We got a mole.\nPETER: (sits on the apparatus, having redressed) Well?\nJAMES FALCON: (enters the testing area with paperwork) I'd cut back on fried foods. But your lab work, the E.E.G. readings, it all looks pretty standard. Nothing to indicate you and the machine share an electromagnetic signature.\nPETER: And there's nothing out of the ordinary?\nJAMES FALCON: Well, like I told your father, your heart rate was a bit elevated. But that could be adrenaline, nerves, stress.\nPETER: Doctor, come on, when I got within fifty feet of that machine, things started flying around the room. My nose started bleeding. You're honestly trying to tell me that that's just a coincidence?\nJAMES FALCON: No. I'm telling you we still have no idea how any of that happened, but from a medical standpoint, you seem perfectly normal. I'm willing to run more tests. But, frankly, I thought you'd be relieved.\nPETER: (smiles. grants him one) Well, hey, you're the doctor.\nWALTER: (enters the test room, trying, and failing, to be soft spoken) Peter. Agent Dunham called. They found a dead shapeshifter. (catching Falcon's attention) She thinks that someone on the inside must be feeding Walternate information.\nPETER: Let's go. (pat to the back of Falcon) Thank you. (leaves with Walter)\nJAMES FALCON: You're welcome.\n(gathering around Astrid's workstation)\nBROYLES: We assume the shapeshifter was killed because someone knew it was just a matter of time before we I.D'd him.\nPETER: We need to round up anybody who had access to the other Olivia's hard drive.\nBROYLES: We're already on it.\nPETER: All the FBI decryption teams. Anybody in Massive Dynamic.\nOLIVIA: (think about something else) Okay, Peter.\nBROYLES: Trust me, we're on top of it. We're questioning every one of them as we speak. In fact, that's what Walter and Nina are doing at Massive Dynamic now.\nPETER: What about the rest of her file? Does it mention any other shapeshifters other than Baird?\nASTRID: Well, Newton's mentioned. And if there are two of them, we're assuming there are more. But there are hundreds of names throughout the file. Just lists of government employees, local cops.\nBROYLES: We're running profiles on all of them now. We're looking for anything that might indicate a recent change in behavior. Anything which would suggest having been replaced by a shapeshifter.\nOLIVIA: (ready to get to work) Alright, well, it looks like a big job. So how can we help you sift through the data?\nASTRID: (hesitantly) Um, it's probably not a good idea.\nOLIVIA: Why not?\nPETER: (knows why. flatly) Because she wrote about me.\nBROYLES: (concurs. flatly) Yeah. Some parts of this read like a diary. You're quite prominent.\nPETER: We should get to Massive Dynamic.\nOLIVIA: (upbeat. to Astrid) Okay, well, call me if you find something. (leaves with Peter)\nBRANDON: (as he draws a blood sample) State your full name, please.\nMATT GOLDIN: (even tone) Special Agent Matthew Nicholas Goldin.\nJAMES FALCON: Does the name Michael Baird mean anything to you?\nMATT GOLDIN: (flatly) No, it does not.\nBRANDON: Where were you born?\nMATT GOLDIN: Brooklyn, New York.\nPETER: (watching the interview on the monitor in the observation) How many more are there?\nNINA: Twenty-two of our people. Another seven from the FBI. So far, all the blood tests have come back negative. But that doesn't rule out the possibility of a human mole.\nPETER: Lie detectors are unreliable.\nOLIVIA: He's right. People beat them all the time.\nNINA: (confident) Well not this one. William designed it. It measures the slightest shift in facial muscles, which allows us a link to stress and a particular emotion. His facial muscles tell us that his stress is not connected to feelings of guilt or shame.\nWALTER: (impressed) Very clever. I wish I'd thought of it.\nPETER: We need to keep everybody in custody until we find the leak.\nNINA: There are nearly thirty people on the list. I'm not sure that's practical.\nPETER: (slightly accusatory) Do you actually want to catch this mole, Nina?\nBRANDON: (over the video feed) Do you know the identity of any shapeshifter?\nMATT GOLDIN: (over the video feed) No, I don't.\nBRANDON: (over the video feed) Do you know anything about the murder...\nNINA: Walter, do you have a moment?\nWALTER: Yes. Yes, of course. (leaves the room)\nBRANDON: (over the video feed) Have you ever given anyone information to assist in the murder of a shapeshifter?\nMATT GOLDIN: (over the video feed) No, I haven't.\nNINA: (hands over a box marked DNA) You were right. I found William's research. His notes suggest that he designed a retroviral serum based on your DNA that will regrow your brain tissue.\nWALTER: That's wonderful. Oh, thank you, Belly. (opens the box)\nNINA: Walter, William experimented with lab animals first. A rat and a chimpanzee. Now, back in the '90s, we had a small lab fire. The original labels were destroyed. I'm going to ask the lab to run diagnostics on all three. Then they should be able to tell us which one was made for you. (as he snorts the DNA sample she handed to him) Walter.\nWALTER: Don't worry. I've snorted worse. A few good whiffs and my brain should be able to begin to regrow its missing parts.\nNINA: And what if the serum is not based on your DNA?\nWALTER: (deadpan) Well, I'll probably get a rash.\nNINA: Well, I'm afraid we've got a bigger problem on our hands. I'm worried about Peter.\nWALTER: So am I. But that's what this is all about.\nNINA: Peter has endured a lot recently. Maybe he should talk with someone. No, what I'm trying to say is there are people that are trained to help.\nWALTER: (intently) Nina, he's my son. I'm the one that needs to help him.\n(Olivia and Peter continue to watch the on-going interview process over the video feed in the Observation Room)\nBRANDON: (over the feed) Do you know anything about the murder of Michael Baird?\nAGENT RUIZ: (over the feed) No.\nBRANDON: (over the feed) How long have you been in the FBI?\nAGENT RUIZ: (over the feed) About five years.\nOLIVIA: (turns from the monitor) Peter.\nBRANDON: (over the feed) And you never heard of Michael Baird before I brought his name up...\nOLIVIA: (heartfelt) About the other Olivia's files, I know that you slept with her and I know that you're trying to protect me. But reading about it isn't going to make it worse. Peter, I'm not doing any good here. But if I could help Astrid with the files--\nPETER: Olivia. I've conned people. And I know what I would've written about them. She must have thought that I was a fool. (sullen) And I don't want you to see me like that.\nBRANDON: (over the feed) Alright, we're done. (to Peter and Olivia once they join him) That's it. We've talked to everybody.\nPETER: We should call Broyles and tell him.\nOLIVIA: What about Doctor Falcon?\nBRANDON: Doctor Falcon wasn't on the team that worked on the hard drive.\nOLIVIA: Maybe not, but he was asking questions about it yesterday at the hangar.\nBRANDON: (makes a call) Hey, it's me. Uh, could you send Doctor Falcon up, please? (listens) Why not?\nOLIVIA: What?\nBRANDON: Doctor Falcon left work early.\n(Broyles leads the science team and a large tactical squad to raid the house of James Falcon. agents rush into the house and fan-out looking for their target. )\nTACTICAL RAID: Clear. Clear. Clear.\n(on the floor of the first floor living room, Olivia locates Falcon.. disabled in a pool of his own mercury)\nOLIVIA: (over the phone) The exact same as Michael Baird. Two shots in the head and his data storage unit had been removed.\nASTRID: (in the lab, searching Bolivia's database) You're right. Doctor James Falcon. He's on here. He's part of a list of Massive Dynamic employees.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter, on the other side of the room) Doctor Falcon's name is on her computer.\nASTRID: So if Walternate's knocking these guys off, they must know something important.\nWALTER: (to himself) Damn.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Tell Walter I feel the same.\nASTRID: That's not about the shapeshifters. Walter's giving himself an IQ test.\nOLIVIA: (slightly amused) Okay. Well, Falcon's body is being taken to the lab. So when Walter finishes exercising his mind, can you get him to take a look? And maybe he can find something that will help us identify the killer.\nASTRID: Of course.\nOLIVIA: (after the call) Astrid's still going through her files. But so far no luck identifying the remaining shapeshifters.\nPETER: Yeah. The techs are drawing a blank too. I don't think we're gonna find anything in here that's gonna tell us who Falcon was working with.\nOLIVIA: God, it feels like every time we learn something new, we're still a step behind. If we could get to one of these shapeshifters, maybe we could finally get answers.\nWALTER: (unzipping the body bag containing James Falcon) My bone saw, Dear. The aspirator, voltmeter, and a ripe banana.\nASTRID: (worried about potential forensic applications) Please tell me the banana's for you.\nWALTER: I had a sudden craving. (reflective) It's odd though. Bananas are typically my least favorite fruit. Oh, news. (about a nearby monitor)\nASTRID: (checks the new data) Yeah, but it's not good. Another twenty names have been cross-checked from Fauxlivia's files. None of them are shapeshifters.\nWALTER: So you've read all of Olivia's files?\nASTRID: Yeah. Most of them.\nWALTER: (quietly concerned) What did she have to say about me?\nASTRID: (upbeat smile. honest) She liked you. She thought that you were kind and brilliant.\nWALTER: (accepts the assessment) Would you help me with him, please, Dear? (brings Falcon to an upright position and checks the incision on his lower spine)\nASTRID: Walter! (after he grimaces like an aggressive, non homo-sapien, primate)\nWALTER: Oh. I'm sorry. That was very rude. (thinks about his facial tick) I was displaying dominance. 'scuse me? The serum I took. It must have been meant for a chimpanzee.\nASTRID: You mean it's growing chimp DNA in your brain?\nWALTER: Well, just a bit. It's fascinating though, isn't it? (now intrigued) How the tiniest change in our composition can yield such drastic changes in our behavior. It's not surprising, really. After all, we share fifty percent of our DNA with a banana.\nASTRID: You sure it isn't dangerous?\nWALTER: No. It'll pass. My immune system will recognize it as foreign and reject it. (reclines the shapeshifter) So... the bone saw, please. Hmm.\nASTRID: What is it?\nWALTER: I'm not sure. Magnify... (checks the fingernails of the corpse with a large lense) Looks like blood.\nOLIVIA: (examines an exterior window) So this must've been how he got in.\nPETER: It looks like he used a knife to jimmy open the window.\nOLIVIA: Which would suggest that he and Doctor Falcon were strangers, or otherwise he would've used the front door. Right?\nPETER: Hmm. (looks around the room)\nOLIVIA: Peter. (changing the subject) I owe you an apology. (forthright)\nPETER: For what?\nOLIVIA: The last few weeks have been really hard for me. I've been so focused on what the other Olivia did to me that I... I just haven't thought about what she did to you.\nPETER: Look, Olivia--\nOLIVIA: And I want you to know that I'm sorry and that I get it now. The good news is... is that she's gone. I know it doesn't feel like that at the moment, but she is gone. And, um, we can get past it.\nPETER: (smiles) Thank you. (phone vibrates. reads the message) I've got to do more tests at Massive Dynamic.\nOLIVIA: Do you want me to drive you?\nPETER: No. I'll just take the train. But could you call Walter and let him know I'll be home late and not to worry?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nPETER: Thank you. (walks off)\nOLIVIA: (answers ringing phone) Dunham.\nASTRID: (from the lab) It's me. We just found blood under Doctor Falcon's fingernails.\nOLIVIA: So the killer is human?\nWALTER: Appears so. Type A positive. It's fairly common. I'm A positive along with one-third of the population.\nASTRID: I'm searching Massive Dynamic's personnel files now and there is only one person with that blood type who had access to Fauxlivia's files. Brandon Fayette. Nina Sharp's Chief Scientist.\n(a woman rushes down a bustling urban street checking to see if anyone is following her. she cuts between two buildings, up a staircase, through a loading dock and into a quiet back alley, still checking behind her. she is immediately solicited)\nTRANSIENT: Spare some change, lady?\nJACKIE BERMUDEZ: (calmly) Yeah. (reaches for her purse) Sure. (grabs the hand of the transient, snaps his neck, then plugs her shape-changing device into his palate. she crushes portions of her face for the pending reconfiguration, then initiates the device)\n(Nina escorts Broyles, Dunham and two additional agents quickly through the halls of her facility en route to what may be a crucial arrest in the case of Bolivia's compromised database)\nBROYLES: (as his agents level their weapons at the snacking scientist sitting in his lab) Don't move.\nBRANDON: (intimidated, and sporting a mouth full of lunch) Can I swallow?\n(the shapeshifter finishes the transformation it initiated just a minute earlier and secures its' shape-changing device once it has fully adopted the appearance of the transient male it just killed. then, from the loading dock behind it)\nPETER: Hey, Bermudez. (walks from the dark breezeway firing four shots from his silenced pistol into the shapeshifters torso)\nINTERVIEWER: (questioning the one man in the process that no one has questioned) Have you ever killed a shapeshifter?\nBRANDON: No. (coy) I've been going to the gym though. I'm kind of stoked you'd think I'd have that kind of strength. You can keep asking me questions. The machine isn't gonna give you a different answer - because I didn't do it.\nNINA: (looking at the monitor in the observation area) He's right. Machine says he's telling the truth.\nASTRID: Hi. What have you got?\nOLIVIA: It's not Brandon. We questioned him and he passed the polygraph.\nASTRID: Well, that's not unheard of. Lots of people defy a polygraph.\nOLIVIA: Not this one. Okay, which one of these haven't you gone through? I understand why nobody wants me to read these files. But what's written here is in the past and what is important is the future. Somewhere in here are the names of the remaining shapeshifters. And we're running out of options.\nASTRID: Yes. And we have to find them before whoever's killing them does. Believe me. I know. Broyles is calling me every twenty minutes to tell me the same thing.\nOLIVIA: At this point, it's not just the shapeshifters that I'm worried about. I mean, if we can find the next target and surveil him, maybe we can catch this guy.\nASTRID: Look, I am really thankful for your help. Seriously. But I've been through this whole stack already.\nOLIVIA: But I'm not just another set of eyes. We're the same. The other Olivia and me. I should be able to think the same way. So maybe I'm gonna be able to find a pattern. (starts reading)\nWALTER: (after assembling a banana split, he answers his phone smeared in whipped cream) Hello?\nNINA: Walter, it's Nina.\nWALTER: Nina. I was just thinking about you. (licks the cream from his finger. then remembers) The first sample is definitely chimpanzee. You can label it now.\nNINA: First sample?\nWALTER: Belly's serum. I'm ready for round two.\nNINA: Actually, I was calling for Peter.\nWALTER: He's not with you? Has he finished the tests already?\nNINA: Finished? No, no, that's why I'm calling. I wanted to schedule a round of tests.\nWALTER: But Olivia said -- (realizes the deception) I must've misunderstood.\nNINA: Walter, I understand how you feel about this testing. And I know that Peter is reticent as well. But I also know that you understand why these tests are so important. Will you tell him I called?\nWALTER: Yes. I'll give him the message. (looks up the stairs towards Peter's room. after the call he enters the room and snoops around. he finds lists of names from the compromised database. names are circled. names of targeted shapeshifters)\n(Peter sits and waits in a vehicle outside of Zach Alperts' home)\nASTRID: (joins her unusually quiet teammate) You okay?\nOLIVIA: (reading from Bolivia's journal) \"It's strange, but at moments when I'm with PB, I find myself forgetting what I'm here for. PB's different than I expected him to be. A sincerity behind his eyes. A deep-seated goodness. It's hard not to get caught up in it. Not to get caught up in him.\" (stops reading) You know, this may have started out as a mission, but it turned into something else. She was starting to have real feelings for him.\nASTRID: (shakes head) Olivia...?\nOLIVIA: No, I mean, and he's a great guy. And, of course, we're the same. She would see what I see. We speak the same. We use the same phrases. I'm reading this and I'm thinking this is how I make sense of things. Make sense of feelings. Of Peter. We even use the--\nASTRID: Olivia?\nOLIVIA: Okay. I think I got something. (grabs a stack of papers) We need the original printout of the file.\nASTRID: Exactly what am I looking for?\nOLIVIA: When I was a little kid, my mother used to call me Olive and hers did too. So I think this is a letter substitution code. So O-L-I-V-E. Uh, \"O\" is the 15th letter of the alphabet. So on the 15th page, the 15th name is...\nASTRID: It's Newton. \"L\" is the 12th letter of the alphabet. 12th name on the 12th page.\nOLIVIA: Michael Baird.\nASTRID: And \"I\" is the 9th letter in the alphabet. The 9th name on the 9th page.\nOLIVIA: James Falcon.\nASTRID: The 22nd name on the 22nd page is Jackie Bermudez.\nOLIVIA: And the last one is Zach Alpert. Okay, we've got'em.\n(Peter shims open a window lock on the building he has been sitting outside of. he climbs through the window, closes it and affixes a silencer to the pistol he has. he slinks across the apartment to the room with the television set that is on. he fires twice into the body sitting in front of the television. it falls to the floor. a dummy dressed in Zach's clothing. Peter turns and is smacked in the head with the butt of a pistol, collapsing to the floor)\nZACH ALPERT: Hello, my friend. I was expecting you.\nZACH ALPERT: (standing over Peter with a pistol to the back of the head) Where are you getting your information? How did you find me? I know who you are, Peter. You might think that we're not allowed to kill you. But that doesn't mean that we can't hurt you. (puts a screwdriver to Peter's temple) We can get everything we need from you even if you only have nine fingers... or one eye. (startled as Walter enters the house)\nWALTER: Peter.\n(Peter knocks the shapeshifter to the ground. Zach reaches for his dropped pistol and has the fingers on his right hand chopped-off by Peter)\nZACH ALPERT: Ahhh! (then shot twice in the chest once Peter recovers the pistol. Walter stares in amazement)\nBROYLES: (answers handsfree phone call while driving) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: (from her vehicle) Jackie Bermudez's apartment was empty. We've got a team sitting on it in case she comes back.\nBROYLES: (nearly forced into a collision by traffic as he speeds through the night) Damn it.\nOLIVIA: You okay?\nBROYLES: Yeah. So five shapeshifters. How'd you break the code?\nOLIVIA: There's only five letters in \"Olive.\" Newton, Baird, Falcon are dead. Bermudez is missing.\nBROYLES: So that leaves one.\n(back in the apartment as he holds the pistol trained on the shapeshifter)\nPETER: How'd you find me, Walter?\nWALTER: I found your notes on Fauxlivia's file. You left -- they were right on your desk. I'm smart enough to open a phone book. (as Peter flips Zach over and carves a trench in his lower spine) I looked the man up. You killed them all, didn't you, Peter?\nPETER: (pulls the memory storage disk from the shapeshifter) And it's been useless. I didn't learn anything from the rest of the data disks. But he's the last one. He must know something.\nWALTER: Peter...\nPETER: I have to know what they know, Walter. I'm tired of being reactive.\nWALTER: Son, this isn't you. You can't just--\nPETER: They're soldiers, Walter. They're here to kill us. (as Zach groans) Besides, they're not even human. And I'm not doing anything wrong. (flips the shapeshifter over and fires a bullet into his forehead)\nWALTER: Then why didn't you tell us? (dismayed) If you weren't doing anything wrong, why didn't you tell us? I don't know what's happened, but this is not you.\nPETER: (answers ringing cell phone) Hello.\nOLIVIA: (calling from her vehicle) Peter, it's me. Good news. We identified the last two shapeshifters. We're heading to Zach Alpert's apartment. It's in Revere. I'll let you know if we find him.\n(pulls the car up to the front of Zach's home, stops and gets out just as Broyles pulls up and parks. both race inside with pistols drawn and find the remains of Zach)\nOLIVIA: (sitting and talking with her colleagues) We failed. He got all of them and now he's gone. We don't know who he was. We're always just a step behind.\nPETER: Well, we still have the other Olivia's computer. (notices he is getting the evil-eye from Walter) Maybe Astrid can learn something.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I should get home. (stands and walks off) Bye, Walter.\nWALTER: Bye. (still eyeing Peter as he follows Olivia to the front door)\nOLIVIA: (privately before leaving) Peter, I read her file. And you should know that you have nothing to be embarrassed about.\nPETER: (somewhat relieved) Thank you.\nWALTER: I think I know what's happening to you. Every relationship is reciprocal, Peter. When you touch something, it touches you. You're changing, son. When you touched the machine, it changed you. It weaponized you.\nPETER: So what do we do now, Walter?\nWALTER: I don't know. (thinks as Peter walks away)\nNINA: I understand you have news on the device.\nBRANDON: Not exactly, but we found these three copies of The First People's book.\nNINA: (stops and studies the new collection) Where did we find them?\nBRANDON: One was in a museum. The others, private collections. The owners did not want to part with them. But it kind of helps when you have unlimited funds.\nNINA: And did they all say the same thing?\nBRANDON: It's in three different languages written by three different authors. They're all published within two years of each other. So forgiving for the translations, they're almost literally word for word.\nNINA: And - what do you make of it? A civilization that existed millions of years before the dinosaurs?\nBRANDON: The planet has been spinning for five billion years. We've only been around for the past 250,000. There were six major extinction events before we even crawled out of the slime. So who's to say that one of them didn't wipe out a great civilization?\nNINA: Hmm.\nBRANDON: There's another thing. When we put the word out that we were looking for copies of the book, we found out we weren't the only ones. A few years ago, somebody started a similar search.\nNINA: Who?\nBRANDON: William Bell.\nNINA: Ah.\n(back at his home, Peter studies his face in the mirror. the eyes are darker. maybe a touch of grey has started. definitely more resolve as he heeds his father's word's. maybe the device has touched him... weaponized him)"

Hmm. Hmm.\nNINA: The First People. You and your secrets. (dials cell phone) Yes, call Agent Dunham, please.\nOLIVIA: (once she has arrived) So they all say essentially the same thing?\nNINA: Not essentially. Precisely. Despite being attributed to different authors. A fantastical idea and I have yet to uncover why William was pursuing it. That being said, it was information in the books that lead us directly to the coordinates where we recovered the pieces of the device.\nOLIVIA: Which makes them impossible to discount.\nNINA: I've been thinking about the journal the other Olivia wrote while she was here. Perhaps her writing might shed some light.\nOLIVIA: Uh, no. I read her file and she didn't mention \"The First People\" or the device.\nNINA: Oh, I hadn't realized. I... imagine that must have been awkward, reading her account of her time with Peter.\nOLIVIA: Though it seems somewhere along the way, she did start to develop genuine feelings for him.\nNINA: I see. And did that surprise you?\nOLIVIA: No. I mean, I understand how that could happen.\nNINA: But what?\nOLIVIA: Just makes me wonder if maybe he feels the same way. And I would understand if he did. I--I was her for a while and she's-- she's like me, but better.\nNINA: Oh, Olivia--\nOLIVIA: No, I mean, she still has her mother and she wasn't experimented on as a child. And she can laugh. She has real friends. She even wears a dress every once in a while.\nNINA: Yes, but even so, you don't know what Peter's thinking. William and I... we also had a complicated relationship. If there's one thing I regret, it's that we never honestly acknowledge how we felt about each other. Don't make the same mistake that I did. If you want to know how Peter feels... ask him.\nRANDALL: What is it?\nGROUP: Ooh!\nRANDALL: Hey, now you can finally get the real answers to the mysteries of the universe, Warren.\nWARREN BLAKE: Yeah. Tell me, oh Eight Ball, will we get the Fowler Grant? (shakes the his new Magic Eight Ball) Oh. \"outlook not so good.\"\nGROUP: ...awww\nWARREN BLAKE: Thank you.\nGROUP: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday Dear Warren, happy birthday to you. (cheers. applause)\nGRACE: Make a wish, Warren.\nWARREN BLAKE: I wish I never hear you guys sing again.\nGRACE: You're very popular today.\nWARREN BLAKE: Oh, yeah, once a year. Thanks, Grace. Gaah! Ah!\nGRACE: Warren?\nWARREN BLAKE: Ah! Ah!\nGRACE: (screams)\nBROYLES: Ninety minutes ago, 9-1-1 received a call about a suspected biological attack. BPD responded, evac'ed the building and set up a quarantine zone.\nOLIVIA: Any casualties?\nBROYLES: One. Doctor Warren Blake. A scientist working in the company's R & D Department. The victim's reaction doesn't match any known biological or chemical weapon.\nWALTER: But why would anyone kill a scientist? What did we ever do?\nPETER: Really?\nWALTER: Oh, my. Look at this. I feel nauseated.\nPETER: Yeah, this is pretty disgusting, even by our standards.\nWALTER: I'm not talking about the body. I fear I may have broken wind inside my suit. Hmm, this is curious. It would appear there isn't a single bone left in this man's body. This blue substance seems to be the culprit. Victim must have inhaled it.\nOLIVIA: Which caused his bones to disintegrate?\nWALTER: Ingenious. It destroyed bone matter but was nonreactive with everything else. The work of a highly proficient chemist, no doubt.\nPETER: I found the source. That's an odd delivery system. Bonus points for the creepy factor though.\nOLIVIA: This was definitely personal. It was his birthday. The card says, \"from Madison.\"\nPETER: So who's Madison?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. This was sent to Blake, but there's return address on it.\nPETER: What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: That this is too big to go in a mail drop.\nWALTER: Did I miss something?\nPETER: Yeah, our first lead.\nWALTER: Oh.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. Broyles tracked the postal code. The package was sent from Chelsea two days ago, so I'm just downloading the post office security footage. Okay. Let's see if we can find our guy.\nASTRID: Doctor Warren Blake was noted for his recent work in vaccinating thousands of people in underdeveloped countries. This guy cured diseases. He saved lives. How come all the creeps go after the good guys?\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nASTRID: How many times are you gonna test that? Or is this just a way for you to break your diet?\nWALTER: Do you think I enjoy eating greasy fried food? You're right. But if I can figure out exactly what this substance is, then we may be able to determine where it comes from. Look. The molecules in the powder bond with calcium, but they also appear to be capsulized, which preserves the agent until it's delivered into the host. And --\nASTRID: What?\nWALTER: Belly and I worked on a similar technique in the '70s when we were trying to find a way to vaccinate people without their knowledge. We discontinued the project when Tricky Dicky tried to use our research to develop biological weapons.\nASTRID: You used to work for President Nixon?\nWALTER: It was uncomfortable. His wife... kept coming on to me. Now, little lady, let's see what makes you tick. Because if I'm right, this is not some rogue's creation at all.\nOLIVIA: Astrid... could you run this for me, please?\nASTRID: You found the suspect?\nPETER: Good thing lunatics still have to use the postal service.\nWALTER: Well, that makes two breakthroughs. I believe this is military. Ours, to be precise.\nOLIVIA: U.S. Military? How would our suspect get his hands on something like that?\nASTRID: Because he's a former Marine. His name is Aaron Downey. He doesn't have a criminal record. He has a military one.\nPETER: So he used his clearance to get access to the powder.\nASTRID: It's not likely. He's been out of the service for four years.\nOLIVIA: Okay, what's his last known address? (makes a quick cell phone call) This is Dunham. I need a team in Quincy now.\nRADIO CHATTER: Up front! You two, go! Go! We're clear right. Clear!\nSWAT #1: No chem or bio agents. We're clear.\nRADIO CHATTER: No chem or bio! Go ahead. Take the hall. Okay.\nOLIVIA: (checks the kettle on the stove) Still hot. We just missed him.\n(later as the house is being investigated)\nPETER: So how does a Marine end up a terrorist?\nOLIVIA: It says here that Downey's service record was impeccable and then four years ago, he just abruptly resigned his commission.\nPETER: Does it say what he did after that?\nOLIVIA: No. He was off the grid for a couple years. But when he did resurface, he bought this house. All cash.\nPETER: Interesting. So who is she?\nOLIVIA: She was obviously important to him. Maybe she knows where he is.\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: Do you still think about her?\nPETER: Excuse me?\nOLIVIA: Well, you've bought me one hundred cups of coffee and you know that I take it black with one sugar, but this morning you brought me one with milk and I'm assuming that that's the way the other Olivia likes hers.\nPETER: Yes. I think about her all the time. I think about how she used my feelings for you to manipulate me. How she lied to me and everybody else.\nOLIVIA: No, before you knew she wasn't me. She was fun, right? She had an easier smile. I mean, that's what you said.\nPETER: Olivia, I said that because I wanted you to know that I noticed the differences. But I thought it was because of me. Because of us. I thought that I was bringing out a different side in you. But it was never because I wanted to be with her more. Because I don't. I'm sorry about the coffee.\nSWAT #2: Agent Dunham. We've got something downstairs.\nOLIVIA: Can you finish up here?\nPETER: Yeah.\nBROYLES: (studies a large case with half of its' heavy duty cannisters missing) Military ordinance is serialized and the serial numbers have been filed down. They're stolen.\nOLIVIA: So... where are the other three?\nPETER: (hears a distant phone ring then sees a man dash across the hip roof outside the second story window) He's here! Freeze! (runs after him. jumps from balcony to roof, to roof) Freeze! FBI! (both jump to the ground. the man he is chasing flees into the street and is struck by a passing vehicle)\nDOCTOR: Mister Downey's been stabilized, but there's a fair bit of swelling in the brain, and that's pushing down on the brain stem, effectively cutting off the blood supply.\nOLIVIA: So what are the chances that he'll regain consciousness?\nDOCTOR: We just don't know. The brain damage is substantial.\nWALTER: May I see his medical chart?\nDOCTOR: Sure. If he does come out of the coma, he won't be able to talk or swallow or even breathe without a machine.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.\nPETER: So much for interrogating him.\nWALTER: Hmm.\nOLIVIA: What is it, Walter?\nWALTER: It says there's still neural activity in the cerebrum. Low levels, but it's there. I may know a way to question the suspect. But I'll need to go back to the lab first to think about it.\nOLIVIA: The woman in the photos at Downey's house, it's his ex-wife. She agreed to come in and talk to us. Walter, we'll drop you off at the lab.\n(sitting and conducting a friendly interview)\nOLIVIA: (shows her photo) This is Doctor Warren Blake. We found his body yesterday. Do you know him?\nSARA DOWNEY: Uh... he finally - he finally did it. He said he was going to kill him. I just never took him seriously.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. What are you saying?\nSARA DOWNEY: Aaron... left the Marines to do some private contractor work. The money was really good, but he had to be overseas for a couple of years. When he got home, we wanted to start a family. It was great at first. I mean, I got pregnant and we bought a house. And then, um... seven months into the pregnancy... our baby died.\nOLIVIA: Oh, I'm so sorry.\nSARA DOWNEY: The doctor said that there was something wrong with Aaron. Some DNA pathogen that he passed on to our child. Aaron was convinced that it had something to do with his time overseas. He kept talking about a weapons project, that he must have been exposed to something. Doctor Blake was the scientist who oversaw it.\nPETER: Sara, did he happen to tell you the name of that project?\nSARA DOWNEY: No, Aaron never said. All he talked about was Doctor Blake. He blamed him for Maddy's death.\nOLIVIA: Maddy?\nSARA DOWNEY: Madison. That was gonna be our daughter's name. She died like all the others.\nOLIVIA: What others? There were two other men in Aaron's unit.\nSARA DOWNEY: He never told me their names, but their babies died the same way.\nPETER: I'm sorry to ask you this, but how did your daughter die?\nSARA DOWNEY: They said it was some kind of bone disease. It left her without a skeleton.\n(walking the corridors after the interview)\nOLIVIA: So we have three missing canisters and two men with a grudge.\nPETER: So you're thinking revenge too?\nOLIVIA: Well, he killed Blake with his own weapon. I'm gonna call Broyles and see if he can dig up some of Blake's old research grants. If we can find out more about this project, then maybe we can find the names of the other two men.\nPETER: (answers ringing cell phone) Hello?\nWALTER: Peter? I need to be picked up.\nPETER: Where are you calling me from, Walter?\nWALTER: (standing at a pay phone near a busy, four-lane divided highway) Uh, New Hampshire, I believe. Mile marker 259 on the I-89. Peter, bring your wallet. I haven't got any money and I'm starving!\n(chatting as Peter refuels the Vista Cruiser)\nOLIVIA: Walter, you still haven't told us. Where exactly were you driving to?\nWALTER: I didn't see the gas light come on.\nOLIVIA: That wasn't my question.\nWALTER: In the Wooster Cortexiphan Trials there was a boy, Simon Phillips. He lives just up the road here. I believe he may be able to help us.\nPETER: Help us how?\nWALTER: (scolding) Peter, don't spill it. The paint on the car is very delicate.\nOLIVIA: Broyles pulled all the names from the Wooster Cortexiphan Trials months ago and I don't remember a Simon Phillips.\nWALTER: Because he wasn't in the records. He didn't complete the program. Simon was beginning to develop the ability to read minds. We hadn't intended it to happen. None of the other children were affected in such a way.\nPETER: You threw him out of the trial, didn't you, Walter? 'cause you knew if he read your mind, he'd know your secret, that you had taken me from the other side.\nWALTER: Well, whether or not he completed the trial is inconsequential. He had the ability once.\nOLIVIA: Well, how do you know that he can still access it?\nWALTER: It's probably dormant, but if I can somehow reactivate Simon's ability, then we could use him to read Downey's mind, find out where the next attack's coming from. (as a VW bug drives) Oh, look! (socks his son in upper arm) Punch buggy! Blue. (amused with himself)\n(the trio approaches a rural cabin surrounded by substantial fencing and a trespass warning)\nOLIVIA: I don't think this guy's big on company.\nPETER: I'm guessing you didn't call ahead.\nOLIVIA: (knocks on the heavy wood door) Mister Phillips? (walks to a window) Hello?\nPETER: (notices an urgently bouncing man) Walter, you don't have to be so nervous. I don't even think he's home.\nWALTER: I'm not nervous. It was a long car trip. Listen. I need to pee.\nOLIVIA: How do we know that he still lives here?\n(Walter finds relief at the nearby pond, finishes his business and turns to find a truly nervous man pointing a pistol at him)\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (responding to Walter's thoughts) Yes, I know who you are. (listens and responds) No, I wouldn't call it wonderful at all.\nWALTER: (thinking randomly)\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (repeating the random thoughts) Bacon, unicorns... Peter's birthday, dash of cinnamon, Z-two equals z-one squared plus c, Reiden Lake. What does that mean, huh? What are you trying to do to me?\nWALTER: Nothing. It's just my mind does that sometimes. (continues random thoughts)\nSIMON PHILLIPS: You need to leave.\nOLIVIA: (pointing her pistol) Put your gun down.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (nothing crosses his mind) How come I can't hear you? Why can't I read you?\nWALTER: She's another Cortexiphan subject. Sometimes you children are immune to each other's abilities. (adds the thoughts) I know what it's like. What's wrong with him?\n(Simon collapses. Later, Olivia sits alone with him inside the cabin as the Bishops wait outside)\nWALTER: Every new thought he reads is an added stressor. To cope, his brain pumps adrenaline and cortisol into his system. Naturally, he experiences headaches, nausea, accelerated heart rate. That's why he gets sick.\nPETER: How many more, Walter? How many more are gonna come crawling out of the woodwork?\n(inside the cabin, the two former test subjects share a hot beverage)\nSIMON PHILLIPS: Thanks.\nOLIVIA: You're welcome.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (smiles) It's refreshing, you know, not, uh--not being able to read your mind. It's the, um -- it's the first real conversation I've had in twenty years. So it started when I was about ten. It was, uh, small at first. Just hearing other kids' thoughts at school, but then it kept getting worse. And now I can't control it. I can't turn it off. Whenever I get within 50 feet of another person, it's like--\nOLIVIA: Is that why you live here? Alone?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: It's the only place that's quiet. Do you know how it feels to be burdened with something that makes it impossible for you to relate to another person? That makes you feel completely alone in the world?\nOLIVIA: I can imagine. Simon, I know that dealing with our capabilities can sometimes be difficult, but... they can also help people.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: Look, I don't have to be able to read your mind to know that you want something. What is it?\nOLIVIA: We need you to help with an investigation. We need you to read a suspect's mind.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: No. I don't think so.\nOLIVIA: Please, Simon, come back to Boston with me.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: A city the size of Boston? You've got to be joking. All those thoughts, they're like millions of needles in my brain. I'm sorry. There's gotta be another way.\nOLIVIA: Look, I know what I'm asking of you, but, Simon, I'm afraid that if you don't help us, more people will die. Please.\n(three executives hurry into a glass elevator to get up to a short notice meeting)\nDICK: Can you believe Barry pulling this on us last-minute? Emergency board meeting at Five O'clock? I've got dinner in the city in an hour. Ninety-three is gonna be brutal. Is this a joke? (notices a rag doll attached to the ceiling) \"Happy Birthday from Carla\"?\n(the doll deploys a fine blue powder, filling the small enclosure and killing the occupants)\nHOSPITAL CHIEF: (barking orders over the chaos in the hallways) I want non-critical patients in the lobby! Take Mister Johnson to the cafeteria, we've got the beds set up there. Ahh, we are moving them as quickly as we can.\nBROYLES: Thank you.\nHOSPITAL CHIEF: Can I ask what this is for?\nWALTER: We need a mind reader to help us find a bomb.\n(after the evacuation, Olivia escorts Simon through the quiet halls to Downey's bedside. Broyles and the Bishops watch on a monitor in an isolated room)\nPETER: We should think of a backup plan.\nBROYLES: You got any ideas?\nOLIVIA: (after sitting briefly next to the brain-damaged murderer) It's not working, is it?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (breathless from the clutter he was trying to process) Maybe if you, uh... ask him a question.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Aaron, can you focus on my voice? Can you hear me talking to you?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (hears the words that Downey heard from his ex-wife) The doctor says there's something wrong with our baby. It's completely oxidized.\nOLIVIA: Aaron... who are you working with? Who else was a part of the project? (after Simon vomits) You okay?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: Get me a pen.\n(once Simon has written all of the thoughts that he was able to read, Walter reviews the list with rest of the team.\nWALTER: Well, what about the plate of vegetables?\nPETER: Let's just assume for right now that the vegetables are inconsequential. Was there any reference in Downey's file to Maryann?\nOLIVIA: No. Okay, what about Project Jellyfish?\nWALTER: Jellyfish are one of few creatures without any bones.\nBROYLES: The weapons program Blake and Downey worked on.\nPETER: Yeah, that's got to be it.\nBROYLES: (answers his ringing cell phone) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: He can barely function around people. The Cortexiphan Trials ruined his life. He's broken.\nPETER: Olivia, I know what you're thinking. You and he are nothing alike.\nBROYLES: (after his call) There's been another attack. Same M.O. The powder killed three senior executives at Canopy One.\nPETER: Canopy One the defense contractor?\nOLIVIA: Do you think that's who's funding the weapons project that Downey and the others were working on?\nBROYLES: I don't know. I'm gonna call Nina Sharp. She's had more experience with the Defense Department than I have. Let me know if you two turn anything up. (leaves)\nOLIVIA: Okay. (rejoins Simon as he draws) Hi.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: Did it help?\nOLIVIA: We don't know yet. We're, uh-- we're hoping so. (about the drawing) Who is she? You had drawings of her in your cabin.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: She works at a coffee shop by my house.\nOLIVIA: What's she like?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: She's perfect.\nOLIVIA: You haven't met her, have you?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: I see her sometimes when I drive by.\nOLIVIA: Is it because you think it would be too painful?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: Look, even if she pretended to be nice or to be my friend or even flirted with me out of some kind of pity, I would know how she really feels. That I'm too much of a freak for her to even consider being with.\nOLIVIA: But... but you don't know that. That's what you're afraid is gonna happen. And so what if you find out that -- that she's not interested or that there's somebody else on her mind or that she doesn't love you. I mean, isn't it - isn't it better to know?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: No one should know exactly what someone else is thinking.\nOLIVIA: Probably not, but I wouldn't mind having that ability right now.\n(Simon turns and looks at Peter at the end of the hall, reading a thought or two of his)\nNINA: Officially, Project Jellyfish never existed.\nBROYLES: You brought me all the way out here to tell me that?\nNINA: No. (to her aide) Send Agent Edwards in, please.\nBROYLES: I might have guessed that this involved the CIA.\nAGENT EDWARDS: It doesn't. But Nina asked me to do some digging and we both know that what Nina Sharp wants, she gets. So... Jellyfish. It was a weapons project. Three men carried out the live field tests.\nBROYLES: How did they survive?\nAGENT EDWARDS: Apparently they were inoculated. But when they tried to start families, the...\nBROYLES: ...the toxin affected their unborn children.\nAGENT EDWARDS: Now, I couldn't find anything in Downey's personal file you haven't already seen. But I found something in the D.O.D. payroll database. Turn to the last page. In addition to a large cash payment, Downey was given three acres of government land. Farm land at Pembroke, twenty-five miles south of Boston.\nVANNOY: (enters the abandoned barn and approaches his comrade) How's it coming? Are we good?\nDILLON: (activates the dispersal charge in the vest on a mannequin. a dark blue cloud fills the barn) Yeah, we're good.\nWALTER: (after returning from the contaminated area and removing his bio-hazard hood) We're fine. The powder is fully oxidized.\nOLIVIA: (inside the barn. looking at the test dummy) Jeez.\nWALTER: The vest would allow them to spread the powder themselves.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, in large quantities.\nPETER: Yeah, looks like they got bigger plans than just three guys in an elevator.\nOLIVIA: And then there's this. Looks like a map of their next target, right? Maybe an overhead view.\nBROYLES: (calls his agent to a separate area) Dunham!\nOLIVIA: (looks at multiple news clippings) Congressman Jim Thorn. Isn't he a former Army General?\nBROYLES: He was senior military advisor to the Joint Chiefs at the time of Project Jellyfish.\nOLIVIA: So you think he approved the project?\nBROYLES: I need to alert Thorn's detail. (steps away to make a call)\nPETER: (looks at some of the schematics) Didn't Simon write something down about Maryann?\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: When Simon was reading Downey's mind, didn't he say he saw the image of the name Maryann?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, why?\nPETER: 'cause I think I just found her.\nOLIVIA: That's the Fine Arts Museum. Okay, so what does the museum have to do with Congressman Thorn?\nBROYLES: (after his call) He's holding a fundraiser. It's an event for three hundred of his top donors. It started half an hour ago.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: I'm not going home, am I?\nBROYLES: (preparing in the equipment van) Peter's inside briefing the Congressman.\nAGENT #1: How good a shot are you?\nOLIVIA: Uh, I'm okay. Why?\nAGENT #1: If either of those two guys have a hand trigger, you're only gonna get one shot. Put it through the mouth to sever the spinal cord. That way the suspects won't have a chance to detonate.\nBROYLES: Are you sure he's up for this?\nOLIVIA: I hope so. Because without Simon, we can't identify the suspects.\nBROYLES: If Simon can't do it... you get out of there.\nOLIVIA: (approaches the security detail) Agent Dunham with the FBI. Where's Congressman Thorn?\nSECURITY #1: Inside. We've already been through this with your Agent Bishop.\nOLIVIA: Then why haven't you taken him to safety?\nSECURITY #2: You ever try telling a Four-Star General to take a death threat seriously?\nOLIVIA: This is not a threat. I've already seen what these guys are capable of and everyone here is at risk. So you keep him in the back.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: The tall one thinks you're hot.\nOLIVIA: (on her radio in the service corridor) We're making our way to the ground floor.\nBROYLES: (over radio) Copy that.\nOLIVIA: (to Simon as he gets woozy) Okay. It's okay. You can do this.\nDILLON: Hey, you're not supposed to be here. This area is for staff only.\nOLIVIA: Oh, I'm sorry. We're just looking for the restroom. He's had a little bit too much to drink.\nDILLON: (thinking) Who is she? A cop. I have to get out. (aloud) The restroom's downstairs.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: That's him.\nOLIVIA: What?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: That's him.\nOLIVIA: Are you sure?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Wait here. (follows, draws he pistol, shoots him when he ambushes her) Damn it. (over the radio) Suspect one's down, but he's not wearing the vest. The other suspect must be carrying the toxin.\nBROYLES: Copy that.\nOLIVIA: I'm going back out there with Simon.\nWALTER: She'll be alright, Peter.\n(Olivia and Simon make their way through the crowded reception area trying to get a read on the assassin. Simon is overwhelmed by all of the thoughts he is processing, then picks-up on the man they are tracking as he wonders where his co-conspirator has gone)\nVANNOY: (thinking) Where's Thorn? Something's not right. This is not how it's supposed to go. Where's Dillon?\nSIMON PHILLIPS: He's here.\nVANNOY: (thinking) Something is definitely wrong.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: (looks up at a man climbing the grand staircase) There. Blue tie.\nVANNOY: (thinking) Thorn should be here by now.\n(Olivia has the man in sight and hurries up the adjacent staircase)\nSECURITY #2: (to Vannoy as he shows interest in the Congressman's side room) I'm sorry, sir. You can't enter here.\nVANNOY: Oh, I'm looking for my wife. I think she went out onto the balcony.\nSECURITY #2: You'll need to use a different exit. (puts his hand out to stop the intruder and is faced with the assassins hand trigger)\n(Olivia fires from across the landing through the back of the assassin's skull. the crowd scatters in shock. the security man opens the jacket of the dead man and finds the intricate bio-weapon strapped around his chest. Olivia looks down to check Simon, cowering against the base of the stairs in discomfort)\nPETER: (later, as the assassins are wheeled out in bodybags, an offering) Coffee. (hands over a cup) Black, one sugar.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: And I've been meaning to tell you... you look great in the dress.\n(Walter approaches Simon, somber and wanting to say something. The two make eye-contact. Walter leaves it at that)\n(late at night and out of their formal wear, Olivia walks Simon to his front porch)\nOLIVIA: Thank you. It doesn't have to be like this, you know? Living out here the way that you do. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you should go and talk to that girl.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: You still don't understand, Olivia. We're not supposed to know what people think.\nOLIVIA: Simon, don't let your ability stop you from living your life.\nSIMON PHILLIPS: I may not be able to read your mind, but I read his. (hands over an envelope) This is what it's like to be me. (Simon steps into his home as Olivia leaves with the envelope)\n(Nina pours over multiple copies of various different The First People books from around the globe.\nNINA: (realizing something significant) No.\n(Nina compiles the names of the different authors and determines that the names are all anagrams for one man)\n(in an otherwise unoccupied sports venue, the manager sweeps the smooth floors with a soft broom and comes toe-to-toe with an old acquaintance in high-heeled boots)\nSAM WEISS: I can see you didn't bring your bowling shoes. That's gonna be a problem if you intend to break a hundred.\nNINA: Maybe next time. Tonight, I have a different problem. Tell me about The First People. Start with why those books seem to indicate that you wrote them, then move on to what the device is intended for.\nSAM WEISS: So you found it.\nNINA: You never told me about this.\nSAM WEISS: Ahem. I'm not your problem. Peter Bishop is.\nNINA: Go on.\nSAM WEISS: Okay. What I can tell you is this... That device can either be used as a tool of creation or as a weapon of destruction. Depends on your point of view. And Peter Bishop is uniquely tuned to operate it. (sits on the ball return) Whatever frequency Peter's vibrating at will determine how the machine reacts.\nNINA: And what determines Peter's frequency?\nSAM WEISS: Depends on his state of mind, which, in turn, will depend on who he ends up with. Olivia from here or Olivia from over there. Whichever one he chooses, it'll be her universe that survives.\nNINA: So in that case, there's no cause for concern. He'll choose our Olivia.\nSAM WEISS: I wouldn't be so sure of that.\n(Olivia sits and reads the note from Simon)"

Final boarding for Gotham Air Flight...\nFRANK STANTON: Guess who.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh... well, the voice isn't familiar, but, uh, the hands I like. They're kind of... rugged and sexy. Oh. No, sorry. I - I -- I don't recognize you.\nFRANK STANTON: No, it's my fault. I thought you were someone else.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh. Well, you should probably leave, because I'm waiting for my boyfriend, and we haven't seen each other for a few months, and he's really big and strong, so... but, you know, actually, now that I think about it, there is something in your face that's kind of ringing a bell.\nFRANK STANTON: Really? Yeah, maybe... maybe it's my, um, lips.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hmm.\nFRANK STANTON: It's so good to be home.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You hungry?\nPUBLIC ADDRESS: Due to inclement weather over the Midwest, the following flights have been cancelled -- Glatterflug Flight 7 bound for Chicago. Gotham Air 3 bound for Saint Louis.\nARMAND SILVA: 'Everybody talks about the weather. Nobody does anything about it'. I'm quoting Samuel Clemens.\nHARRY MILLMAN: You stranded too?\nARMAND SILVA: In a way, yeah, I, uh... I'm waiting on someone who got delayed. Could you pass me the salt, please?\nHARRY MILLMAN: Sure.\nARMAND SILVA: Thank you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How was the shower?\nFRANK STANTON: It was hot. I was beginning to think there wasn't a hot shower anywhere in North Texas.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, welcome back to civilization.\nFRANK STANTON: Well, to what do I owe the honor?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You're a national hero. I figured you deserve the good stuff. Cheers.\nFRANK STANTON: Cheers. Hmm. It's good. Liv... everything alright?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What do you mean?\nFRANK STANTON: I don't know. It's just, uh... didn't say a word to me on the drive back from the airport. And when I'd call from Texas, you seemed a bit distant.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, we were distant.\nFRANK STANTON: Yeah, I know. Just you almost... didn't seem like yourself.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh. You know, work's just been kind of crazy.\nFRANK STANTON: Look, I know when I'm away, we can be a bit off. Just want to make sure it's not something more.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. It's just everything's a little overwhelming since Broyles went missing.\nFRANK STANTON: Do you have any leads?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. They, uh, found his car at the edge of a 'No-Go Zone', but nobody knows why it was in there.\nFRANK STANTON: Something classified?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Possibly, yeah. Uh, Lincoln's taking over in his absence. He keeps pressing all the official channels, but we're not getting any answers. They stopped the search.\nFRANK STANTON: I'm sorry I couldn't be here for you. I know how you feel about him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, you're here now. And I'm glad about that.\nFRANK STANTON: Me too.\nHARRY MILLMAN: Help. Please, help.\nFRANK STANTON: You have any idea how much I missed watching you get dressed in the morning? What time is it?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, it's about eight. I thought you might like to sleep in.\nFRANK STANTON: Yeah. Thank you. Hey, uh... you want to get away this weekend?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, sure. Where?\nFRANK STANTON: I don't know. How about we hop on an airship and go down to Annapolis like we used to?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Annapolis?\nFRANK STANTON: Yeah. We can go to the crab shack on the wharf or\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: -- Obrecky's?\nFRANK STANTON: Right. Remember how great their jukebox was?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I would love that. (answers call) Dunham. (listens) Okay. I'm on my way. (to Frank) Bye.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey. I heard they're rerouting all the flights from Newark -- bomb scare?\nLINCOLN LEE: Nope. Spontaneous bug eruption. Guy named Harry Millman, forty-two years old -- they found him in the bathroom. Bugs had eaten their way from the inside out.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, fabulous. Gosh, I was just here last night picking up Frank. So, bugs.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yep.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Ugh, you know how I feel about bugs.\nLINCOLN LEE: Not Charlie. Charlie loves bugs.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Look lively, people. New boss is here.\nLINCOLN LEE: How is it that when you say 'boss', it sounds like insubordination?\nAGENT FRANCIS: You see, that's my tone. Maybe that's why I didn't get the promotion.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah, maybe, or else I'm better than you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, so they're pretty, but what are they?\nLINCOLN LEE: No idea. We've been through what -- three different insect databases? We still can't find a match.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What happened to the other passengers?\nAGENT FRANCIS: We contacted about half of them. Apparently, the bugs don't live outside the body too long. And if somebody had been infected, we would have heard about it by now.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.\nLINCOLN LEE: Maybe some kind of mutant insect bit him, laid eggs under his skin?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That's comforting.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Looks like we got a live one. Gotcha.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Sorry to keep you waiting, Mister Secretary.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I see the piece that Agent Dunham obtained was finally sent over.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Yes, and it seems to be functional. We should have it integrated with the machine by week's end.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Good.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: That's actually not why I asked you here. The experiments with the chemical we synthesized from the other Olivia's brain... it appears there's been a breakthrough.This subject was given his second dose of the day. Forty-three minutes later, this happened.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Crossed over?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: No.\nNURSE: Danny? How are you doing this?\nDANNY: I - I don't... don't know. I'm just... just thinking it... and it's happening. Aah!\nNURSE: Oh, my gawd! Danny! Call Doctor Jackson!\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Nine test subjects get an injection and die within thirty minutes. This one develops a telekinetic ability. What's the difference?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: We'll know more after we dissect his brain, but I have a theory -- age. This subject was the youngest of the group, which would make sense, given your notion that the human brain is infinitely capable at birth. We simply need younger subjects. I think that children...\nSECRETARY BISHOP: -- No.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Sir, we may be close.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: No children. That is not an option. You'll have to try something else.\nMONA FOSTER: Drop your file request on the table. I'm a little busy right now.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, Fringe Division. I'm Agent Olivia Dunham, and this is Agent --\nMONA FOSTER: Agent Charlie Foster -- Francis. I'm Foster... Mona Foster.\nAGENT FRANCIS: We, uh-- we--we met before?\nMONA FOSTER: I treated you for your arachnid infestation. I'm not surprised you don't remember me. You were in a lot of pain. So how are the spiders?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Uh, they're good. They -- they -- sometimes they just itch a little bit.\nMONA FOSTER: Maybe you just need someone to scratch it.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hmm.\nMONA FOSTER: So... what brings Fringe here today? It's order Coleoptera, for sure, Archostemata maybe, but species? No clue. Where did you find this?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, the Empire Docking Station.\nMONA FOSTER: That's kind of an unusual habitat for beetles.\nAGENT FRANCIS: They ate their way out of a person.\nMONA FOSTER: Interesting...\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah.\nMONA FOSTER: Wait here a minute.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Don't even start with me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh...\nAGENT FRANCIS: Don't --\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Bug Girl's got a crush on Charlie.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Bug Girl has a crush on the fact that I got spiders in my blood, Kiddo.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Come on, everybody's looking for someone who's gonna like them for who they are inside, right?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Are you kidding me right now?\nMONA FOSTER: Skelter Beetle... Mansohnium Boogliosus, which answers one question but raises a whole bunch of others.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Such as?\nMONA FOSTER: Such as how is this here? Skelter Beetles are parasitic. They lived exclusively in sheep.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Sheep.\nMONA FOSTER: And given that all the sheep died out ten years ago\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: -- the bugs died with them.\nAGENT FRANCIS: What was it doing inside of a person?\nARMAND SILVA: Specimen number seven was harvested twelve hours ago after a twenty-minute gestation period. I have extracted the epigastric tissue from the beetle's abdomen and... and placed it into the substrate. I am now adding ten milliliters of the protein complex to catalyze a reaction. If the enzyme is present... the indicator will turn pink. Come on.\nLINCOLN LEE: Get local P.D. to check the house if she's not answering her phone.\nAGENT #1: Passenger 23 is clear.\nAGENT #2: Passenger 9 is clear.\nLINCOLN LEE: We've also fully accounted for zeppelin crew and ground personnel.\nFRANK STANTON: The food for the airship? It's supplied by an LFC food services. And it checks out clean so far.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: You're wasting your time. We're not dealing with an outbreak. We've cleared 62.237% of people who could possibly have been exposed. That's enough to make a statistical inference. This is not an epidemic.\nFRANK STANTON: Where do I get one of you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I bet she drives a beetle.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Y - you're not funny.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Listen, if you go on a date with her and you're late, then at least you know that she won't bug out.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Wow. You're original.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey.\nFRANK STANTON: Hey.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What are you doing here?\nFRANK STANTON: Uh, Lincoln requested a CDC liaison. I said I could help.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, Frank, how's cow country?\nFRANK STANTON: Let's just say I'm happy to be back.\nLINCOLN LEE: You find anything?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yep, Mansohnium Boogliosus. Skelter Beetle. They died out with the sheep in '01.\nFRANK STANTON: Huh. Never heard of them. Let me look at that.\nLINCOLN LEE: I guess for you two this kind of thing is romantic? Brings back memories, huh?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hoboken?\nLINCOLN LEE: Uh-huh. There's nothing like a little cholera outbreak to bring two people together. I can only imagine what it is you see in a guy like that.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, he's kind of perfect, isn't he?\nLINCOLN LEE: No, I am perfect, but he's a close second.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Right.\nLINCOLN LEE: Right.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So still nothing on how our victim got infected?\nLINCOLN LEE: Nope. If you learn anything, you let me know.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Mm-hmm.\nLINCOLN LEE: I'll be in Broyles' off-- I'll be in my office.\nFRANK STANTON: See, what's odd is with the sheep they have a symbiotic relationship, but now they're attacking their host. They're eating their way out.\nAGENT FRANCIS: So they look the same, but they're not the same.\nFRANK STANTON: Yeah. Yeah, to put it simply. The question is why. What -- what changed?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Why don't you just ask?\nAGENT FRANCIS: What's that?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: When you don't know the answer to something, you ask someone who does. Put out a Fringe Alert to the public. Odds are that someone will recognize this beetle and call in a tip. In fact, statistics suggest you will get at least two calls.\nFRANK STANTON: I don't know what they pay you here, but I definitely need you in my life.\nJERRY BISSELL: Uh, do you mind?\nWAITRESS: Hi. What can I get ya?\nJERRY BISSELL: A cup of Earl Grey and a piece of, um, cherry pie.\nWAITRESS: Okay.\nJERRY BISSELL: That looks complicated. What is it?\nARMAND SILVA: Uh... I'm a scientist. This is my, uh, research, but, uh... you probably wouldn't understand.\nJERRY BISSELL: Well, try me.\nARMAND SILVA: Do you know the name Jonas Salk?\nJERRY BISSELL: Sure. Who doesn't? He cured polio.\nARMAND SILVA: Have you heard of... Watson and Crick?\nJERRY BISSELL: They're those DNA guys, right?\nARMAND SILVA: That's right, yeah. How about, uh, Doctor Armand Silva?\nJERRY BISSELL: Armand Silva. No. Don't know that one.\nARMAND SILVA: Oh. You will.\nTV ANNOUNCEMENT: Attention, citizens -- this is a Fringe Alert. If you have seen or have any information regarding this bug, known as a Skelter Beetle, please call 7-1-1 and speak to Fringe Division.\nWAITRESS: Have you decided?\nARMAND SILVA: Yeah. I'll have what he's having.\nFRANK STANTON: Hey. Got a minute? Can I ask a favor?\nLINCOLN LEE: Of course. What's up?\nFRANK STANTON: I was hoping if the case wraps up this weekend if Olivia could have a few days.\nLINCOLN LEE: Why? You two got, uh... big plans or something?\nFRANK STANTON: Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.\nLINCOLN LEE: Sure.\nFRANK STANTON: Can you, uh... keep a secret?\nLINCOLN LEE: You kidding me? I have my own, like... Cone of Silence when it comes to secrets. What is it?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Ma'am, nobody's gonna eat your dog, alright? Thank you for calling.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, sir, these bugs do not have control of your wife.\nAGENT FRANCIS: These people are freaks! What's going on in this city? I'm gonna get a sandwich.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, no, sir, I promise that is not the way they work. Yes, you can feel free to call us if something changes. Okay, thank you.\nLINCOLN LEE: How's it going?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Um, well... we have had two hundred phone calls, mostly from nut jobs and scared --\nLINCOLN LEE: Frank's gonna ask you to marry him. I'm serious. This weekend -- he just told me. I - I promised I'd keep it a secret, but you know me, I can't... keep a secret.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, I think I got a legitimate call here. Something up?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No.\nLINCOLN LEE: Uh-uh.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay. Guy used to work at a biology annex. Guy next door to him used to be an expert on Skelter Beetles.\nLINCOLN LEE: Go. Go check it out.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Great.\nLINCOLN LEE: So? What are you gonna say... to Frank? What? I can keep a secret.\nNED DOLEN: Yeah, that's it. Ah, I wish I could forget these things. His name was Armand Silva. He was in virology down the hall. Those damn things were always getting out. I'm a scientist, but I hate bugs.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You know what he was doing with them?\nNED DOLEN: I don't know. We were all working on our own projects. I was harvesting sheep hearts for valve replacement surgeries. So how are they back -- the bugs?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. Do you know where we can find Doctor Silva?\nNED DOLEN: No. In fact, a few years ago, I heard he tried to kill himself. I didn't really know him that well, but, uh... it was like those bugs were his whole life. When the sheep died out, he was a mess. But if he's not dead, he's definitely the guy you want to talk to. If anyone will know how those bugs have come back, it'll be him.\n(a parked vehicle with a dead driver. skelter beetles coming out from his body. on a lower level, Armand catches falling beetles.)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Jerry Bissell, aged 42, worked as a data systems repairman. It says that he ate at the Avenue Road Diner about three hours ago.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, I know that place. It's right around the corner.\nLINCOLN LEE: No luck on Doctor Silva. His last known address is outside of Boston, but nothing in the system on him since the city was ambered back in '04.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No record of his death either.\nLINCOLN LEE: No.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, so that means that he's still out there somewhere.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Hey, look at this... right there. These are so much different. They're so much bigger. I'm gonna take it to forensics, see what they come up with.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey, can you send someone to the diner as well? Maybe somebody saw something.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Oh, great. Now I got, like, two bosses?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's wrong?\nLINCOLN LEE: Keep feeling like I'm missing something... that Broyles would see something I'm not.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln, you're doing fine. Don't worry. We'll catch this guy together.\nREIKO: Do you want me to give you some time alone?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: No. Please don't.\nREIKO: What is it?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You're lovely. You know that?\nREIKO: You're sweet. And you're also avoiding answering my question.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It's... many things. If you had asked me a week ago, I would have told you that I would sacrifice anything... to save our world. But in fact, there are lines I simply cannot cross. Does that make me weak?\nREIKO: No. It's what makes you the most brilliant man I've ever known. And the fact you beat yourself up over these decisions... now, that's what makes me sure of this strength.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I wish I had the same faith. I'm afraid I've failed, Reiko. Peter was here, and... he was here of his own choosing, as he needs to be. And I lost him... I underestimated his attachments over there. I hadn't factored in the girl.\nREIKO: But now you know about the girl. And you know Peter better. You'll get him back.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: How could you be so sure?\nREIKO: Do you trust me?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: More than anyone.\nREIKO: Well, then... trust my perspective on this. I know you, Walter. I've seen your determination, your will. I don't have a single doubt in my mind you'll find an answer. You always do.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hi.\nFRANK STANTON: You're home. I called Atlanta. I found out some information on Doctor Silva. CDC had a grant he applied for on file, back in '97. Claims he was close to a vaccine for the Avian Flu.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Gosh, if that's true--\nFRANK STANTON: I know. It would have saved millions. Thing is his research... it reads a little off the wall. Here, take a look at this. The vaccine was based on an enzyme that the Skelter Beetle produced. And that got me thinking.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You think he's trying to bring the Skelter Beetle back from extinction? Is that even possible?\nFRANK STANTON: Possible, yeah. Certainly not easy. He'd have to clone DNA from a preserved specimen. But the real problem would be that the eggs would never hatch.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Because they only live in sheep.\nFRANK STANTON: Exactly. He'd have to modify them. He'd have to reengineer them to live in a different host.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Like people.\nFRANK STANTON: Sheep and humans share ninety-six percent of the same DNA. And that could account for the reason why the bugs are killing their human hosts. But I just called the lab. They said the bugs they got from the first victim -- they weren't mature enough to create the enzyme.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: But the bugs got bigger with the second victim.\nFRANK STANTON: They did?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. Maybe he is modifying his work. Okay, so say you're right. What would he need?\nFRANK STANTON: Like equipment?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. Call Lincoln. Retro-viral samples.\nLINCOLN LEE: Retro-viral samples.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Plasmid array.\nLINCOLN LEE: Plasmid array.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Liquid spectrometer.\nLINCOLN LEE: Okay, wait, wait. Slow down.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: An electron microscope and also liquid nitrogen -- you got all that? Alright, I'm leaving now, so I should be there in about twenty minutes. Uh, Lincoln said that if you were here, he would kiss you.\nFRANK STANTON: Well, I'm glad he's not here.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. And you will keep the list on you.\nFRANK STANTON: Yes, of course, of course. Keys.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Keys. Yes. Thank you. And my I.D.\nFRANK STANTON: And you forgot this.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh.\nFRANK STANTON: I was gonna wait 'til this weekend. I know we have a lot to figure out. There's your job, and there's my job, and there's my mother. Look, being away from you made me realize how much I can't stand being away from you. Olivia Dunham... will you marry me?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yes.\nFRANK STANTON: Seriously?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hello?\nLINCOLN LEE: Hey. Where are you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's Lincoln. I'm just leaving the house. What's up?\nLINCOLN LEE: Don't come down here. We got a hit. Six months ago, Silva purchased a plasmid array. He had it shipped to a warehouse in Brooklyn. I'm sending you the address now.\nLINCOLN LEE: Silva's unit is Number Twenty-one. I already walked the perimeter. No sign of any other cars. What?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I said yes. Frank asked me, and I said yes.\nLINCOLN LEE: And? You happy?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. I am.\nLINCOLN LEE: Good. Then I am too. Watch your step.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you. Hey... I think someone's here.\nLINCOLN LEE: Hey! Hey! Olivia! Olivia! Damn it!\nVOICE RECORDING: No signal. Please try again.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Aah!\n(Armand gives water to Bolivia. checks his left eye.)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Where's Lincoln?\n(In the cold room, Lincoln looks for something to break the door.)\nLINCOLN LEE: Come on, there's got to be something. There's got to be... yes!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: There are more agents on their way here now.\nARMAND SILVA: I think we both know that's not true. (Armand set up a camera)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Come on, do yourself a favor and just let me go.\nARMAND SILVA: They'll thank me. The whole world... will thank me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you for what -- your vaccine? Is that what you're talking about -- your vaccine? For someone who wants to save lives, you sure don't have much of a problem killing people.\nARMAND SILVA: How many did Salk sacrifice trying to get his answers... Pasteur... in the name of science? When the sheep died out, I tried cows, goats, primates. None of them could host the beetles. Humans were my only option.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What about stopping the research? That wasn't an option?\nARMAND SILVA: No. Because I was too close. And now... now I'm... my work is... is nearly complete. Did you ever ask yourself what you're leaving behind? I have an ability. (picks up a beetle) I was on a path. I had a calling, and the world changed on me. It simply... changed and robbed me of my legacy. This... world, this decaying madness... robbed me.\n(Linc puts on gloves. directs liquid nitrogen to the keypad. breaks the lock.)\nLINCOLN LEE: Come on. (makes a call) This is Agent Lee. I need a tactical unit immediately at my location.\nARMAND SILVA: See, the second batch of specimen were almost mature enough, but not quite. And then I realized... a queen can hatch her own eggs. She can create a legion, enough for my vaccine. One more human host... to bring the queen beetle to term.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: But it's over now, 'cause we know who you are.\nARMAND SILVA: You don't understand. The gestation has already begun.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (looks at the glass of water) What did you give me? What the hell did you give me? (vomits)\nLINCOLN LEE: Don't move! (points a gun to Silva)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln. Lincoln, don't shoot him.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's up to him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. We need his help. I've been infected.\nLINCOLN LEE: Don't worry, Liv. I'm gonna take care of you.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Down! Now! Down!\nFRANK STANTON: Olivia!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Frank! Oh, Frank, Frank.\nLINCOLN LEE: He dosed her.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, Frank, he made me drink the water.\nLINCOLN LEE: Somebody bag that glass!\nFRANK STANTON: What do we do... to stop the infestation? What do we do to stop it?\nLINCOLN LEE: Get her to the hospital.\nFRANK STANTON: Let me go!\nLINCOLN LEE: Get her to the hospital. You're running out of time. Go.\nFRANK STANTON: Go! She's been infected with a deadly parasite. The next ten minutes are critical. In my kit, there's a vial of Metrifonate. It's an antiparasitic. Liv.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah.\nFRANK STANTON: I'm gonna do everything I can. Just hold on.\nLINCOLN LEE: Everybody out... now! (To Armand) Tell me how to save her.\nARMAND SILVA: Oh...\nLINCOLN LEE: (gun point on Armand's head) You have one more chance. Tell me!\nARMAND SILVA: If you want your friend to live, put down the gun and do exactly as I say.\nLINCOLN LEE: Aah! What do you want?\nARMAND SILVA: Bring me those panels over there... and I'll tell you how to save your friend.\nEMT: B.P.'s 140 over 90. Heart rate's elevated. That could just be the adrenaline.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, Frank, my stomach --\nFRANK STANTON: The antiparasitic that I'm going to give you is powerful. It's gonna kill the bugs inside you before they hatch.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Why do I sense that there's a \"but\" coming?\nFRANK STANTON: Because it's a lot for your system to take.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh-huh. So what do we do?\nFRANK STANTON: I don't think we have a choice. Hand me the wand. Can you zoom in?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What do you see, Frank?\nEMT: I see movement!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Where?\nLINCOLN LEE: What the hell am I putting together here?\nARMAND SILVA: You'll work faster if you don't talk.\nLINCOLN LEE: I gave you what you wanted. Now you tell me how to save her.\nARMAND SILVA: She doesn't need saving. I didn't infect her.\nLINCOLN LEE: Uh-uh. She was sick.\nARMAND SILVA: Not because of me. She's not the final host. Aah! Oh!\nEMT: Syringe is ready.\nFRANK STANTON: Look at me. Look at me. It's gonna be okay.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay.\nEMT: Stop!\nFRANK STANTON: What?\nEMT: Take a look at this.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What is it? What is it?\nFRANK STANTON: Are you sure?\nEMT: Look at the Beta HCG levels in her blood.\nFRANK STANTON: The picture on the sonogram...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh-huh?\nFRANK STANTON: You're not infected. You're pregnant.\n(In Armand's warehouse)\nARMAND SILVA: I've done it. The queen is ready. Uhh... Aah! Come here. Make sure... they... spell my name... right.\nFRANK STANTON: Can I come in?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Of course.\nFRANK STANTON: What did the doctor say?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That the baby's healthy and that the, uh-- the fall and the adrenaline triggered some kind of morning sickness.\nFRANK STANTON: How far along are you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Frank...\nFRANK STANTON: Liv, how long you been pregnant?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Six weeks.\nFRANK STANTON: Are you in love with him... the father? That's all I needed to know.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Frank.\nFRANK STANTON: You... were gonna marry me. (walks away)\n(Bolivia grabs her pillows and cries)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Hello?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Mister Secretary, there's been a development. I think I might have another way to bring Peter back from the other universe.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Forgive my intrusion. I hope this isn't a bad time.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Please come in.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I heard the news about your pregnancy. Don't worry. Your position with Fringe Division will remain intact. You'll have whatever resources you need. After all, you are the mother of my future grandchild."

Just as long as you don't discuss religion or politics.\nCHRIS: Oh! Well, it is lovely weather we're having today.\nSYLVIA: See? You do small talk just as good as anyone.\nJIMMY SMITH: Evenin', folks. What unit?\nSYLVIA: Uh, Kimball, 7-C.\nJIMMY SMITH: Enjoy.\nSYLVIA: Thanks.\nCHRIS: Thanks.\n(waiting for the elevator in the lobby)\nSYLVIA: (to a resident making her way down the stairs with her luggage) Oh, is the elevator not working?\nMISSUS MARCELLO: No, it's workin'. Good luck.\n(curbside)\nJIMMY SMITH: Evening, Missus Marcello. Where you heading?\nMISSUS MARCELLO: The Schrodinger Hotel, on Flatbush.\nJIMMY SMITH: You're not leaving too, are you?\nMISSUS MARCELLO: I can't take it anymore, Jimmy. I haven't slept in weeks.\nJIMMY SMITH: Come on, it's not that bad.\nMISSUS MARCELLO: Yet -- and I'm not sticking around to find out how bad it's gonna get. I'm not spending another minute in this building.\nJIMMY SMITH: Alright, alright. At least let me hail you a cab.\n(as her good friend opens the door to Apartment 7C)\nSYLVIA: See? I told you I know where Brooklyn is.\nKIM KIMBALL: Oh, my god. You made it.\nSYLVIA: Hi.\nKIM KIMBALL: You must be Chris. It's so nice to meet you.\nCHRIS: California bubbly?\nKIM KIMBALL: Mm, I like him already. Come in, come in. A bunch of people are out on the balcony. Why don't you guys head out, and I'll get some drinks.\nSYLVIA: Here, I'll come with you. (to Chris) Uh, wine?\nCHRIS: Surprise me.\nKIM KIMBALL: He is handsome.\nSYLVIA: And is sweet and funny.\nKIM KIMBALL: ...and your age, finally. Hey, try some of this chicken. It's amazing.\nSYLVIA: He's great, and at this point, we're practically living together.\nKIM KIMBALL: Really?\nRICK KIMBALL: Who are you living with?\nSYLVIA: Hey, Rick.\nKIM KIMBALL: Her boyfriend. So... have you given him a section of your closet?\nSYLVIA: And half the medicine cabinet.\nKIM KIMBALL: (as the blender starts without warning) Rick!\nRICK KIMBALL: Alright. Alright, I'll call the building manager.\nKIM KIMBALL: Yesterday, the stove comes on completely by itself.\nRICK KIMBALL: Yeah, now we just need to teach it to make us breakfast.\nKIM KIMBALL: Hey! I'm serious. This is not funny.\nRICK KIMBALL: It's kind of funny.\nKIM KIMBALL: Yeah. (as her friend starts into anaphylactic shock) Sylvia? Sylvia... You okay?\nSYLVIA: What's in those?\nKIM KIMBALL: I don't know, what's it? Some type of barbecue?\nSYLVIA: Get my--get my purse!\nKIM KIMBALL: She's having some kind of allergic reaction! Go get Chris!\nRICK KIMBALL: Where's Chris?\nCHRIS: I'm Chris.\nRICK KIMBALL: Sylvia can't breathe. She needs her purse.\nCHRIS: It's with her coat. (runs for coat and purse)\nJIMMY SMITH: (to cabbie as Marcello loads in) To the Schrodinger, corner of Flatbush --\n(bodies start impacting the nearby sidewalk... attendees from the Kimball party)\nWALTER: (sings as he prepares a large breakfast feast) Yum, yum, pigs, bum, pancakes blue. O.J., fresh fruit...\nPETER: What's the occasion, Walter?\nWALTER: Oh, nothing special. But for the past couple of weeks, no new cases and... somehow that has translated into... never seeing Olivia. And I, for one, miss her.\nPETER: Any reason why you didn't mention this to me last night?\nWALTER: Well, would you believe it slipped my mind?\nPETER: No, I would not. You know, Walter, whatever's happening between Olivia and I -- or not happening, as the case may be -- Is really between us. It's none of your concern.\nWALTER: Your happiness is my concern.\nPETER: And while that's very sweet, I'm begging you, please... don't try and force things, okay?\nWALTER: I'm not forcing anything. (answers the knock at the front door)\nOLIVIA: Good morning, Walter.\nWALTER: Yes, it is. It's great to see you, Dear.\nOLIVIA: So what was so important?\nWALTER: Hmm? Important? Breakfast. The most important meal of the day, and I proved it in 1973. Blueberry pancakes. This a Bishop family specialty best eaten while still warm.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you didn't have to do this.\nPETER: That's exactly what I told him.\nWALTER: Ooh, there's something missing. (runs off)\nPETER: He wants us to spend time together.\nOLIVIA: The three of us?\nPETER: No, just the two. Walter! He's not lying, though. The pancakes are fantastic.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna head back to the office.\nPETER: Olivia. Look, I don't approve of his methodology, but... since we're here, we might as well take advantage of the situation and just talk about what's bothering you.\nOLIVIA: I don't really know what to say. Look, I know that you still think about her. I know you had feelings for her. And that you still do. And, frankly, I don't think you've been completely honest with me.\nPETER: Well, you're right. I mean, I haven't told you everything. Mostly because I didn't think that you...\nOLIVIA: ...that I could handle it?\nPETER: I know that you struggle with trust issues. You have a difficult time letting people in.\nOLIVIA: Well, I - I'm struggling because the reasons are real. I'm not making them up.\nPETER: I know. I never wanted to be one of the reasons. And I still think about her, because I spent so long imagining going down that path with you. Imagining what it would be like to wake up in a bed next to you. To sit around, just the two of us having a cup of coffee, reading the paper. And then finally, I had it. I've seen what the two of us together looks like. And it's beautiful.\nOLIVIA: Peter, she's the one that took it away from us, not me.\nPETER: And now? Who's the one stopping us now?\nOLIVIA: (answers mobile phone) Dunham. Yes, sir. We'll be right there.\nPETER: I'm gonna go get Walter.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: Hey, Cupid!\nWALTER: Did my plan work?\nPETER: Well, if your plan was to make things even more awkward and painful between Olivia and I, yeah, worked like a charm.\nWALTER: Perhaps I should have made a frittata.\nBROYLES: Six people attending a party on the seventh floor fell to their deaths last night. One second, they were standing on the balcony... next second, they were hitting the sidewalk.\nOLIVIA: What, they all jumped?\nWALTER: Like a flash mob... of suicide.\nPETER: But jumpers don't usually take their patio furniture when they commit suicide. (to BROYLES) They find any structural damage to the balcony they were standing on?\nBROYLES: First responders didn't detect anything. That doorman, Jimmy Smith, was on duty when they fell.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, I'll meet you guys upstairs. (walks over to JIMMY SMITH) Jimmy, I'm, uh, Agent Olivia Dunham. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple questions about what happened here last night?\nJIMMY SMITH: I don't know -- I don't know what happened. I was helping Missus Marcello hail a cab, and then this body just... hit the ground. And then another and then... they all just came down.\nOLIVIA: But at once? Like they all jumped at the same time?\nJIMMY SMITH: Maybe it's true what they say about this place.\nOLIVIA: What do they say?\nKIM KIMBALL: Sylvia has a peanut allergy, and I guess something that we had catered triggered an attack.\nRICK KIMBALL: I ran out to the balcony to get her boyfriend. We were so busy with Sylvia that... by the time we heard the screams, everyone was... gone.\n(on the balcony)\nWALTER: Don't be a daredevil.\nPETER: I'm not, I'm not. (examining the street below) I don't think these people jumped.\nWALTER: You're right. And even if they just went over the railing, they would have landed farther out.\nPETER: Yeah, simple physics. Instead, they landed directly below us.\nWALTER: It's as if they went straight through the balcony. (jumps, to test balcony's integrity)\nPETER: Let's not push it, alright?\nWALTER: It's fascinating. How -- how do six people fall though a solid floor?\nOLIVIA: Uh, ghosts. Apparently the residents think that the Rosencrantz Building is haunted. Apparently, unexplained phenomena has been happening here for a while.\nPETER: Unexplained phenomena?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, the water pipes would be replaced, and then two days later, explode. Or the electricity would go on and then go off, unexplained. People have been reporting odd sounds.\nPETER: Well, that described just about every single prewar building.\nOLIVIA: Well, half the tenants have already moved out.\nPETER: Now that people have fallen through the balconies, I'm pretty sure they're about to lose the other half. Any ideas, Walter?\nWALTER: I know what's happening here. Ten times, I've flipped this coin. And ten times, I've gotten heads! That's fairly inconceivable. The laws of physics are being disrupted here. The balcony -- here one second, gone the next.\nOLIVIA: What are you saying, Walter?\nWALTER: That, like the other universe, our world is starting to come apart at the seams. And the tear is beginning right here!\nWALTER: Damn it.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what are you looking for?\nWALTER: My seismograph. How am I supposed to measure microquakes without my damn seismographs?\nPETER: Walter, we keep 'em in the back.\nWALTER: Then why are you all sitting around?\nASTRID: I'll go get it.\nPETER: You know, a thank you wouldn't kill you.\nWALTER: Oh, I'm sorry if at this moment, when the universe is collapsing, I forgot the magic word.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I understand that you're worried, but at the moment, we don't know for sure that what we're dealing with is a soft spot.\nWALTER: It is not a soft spot, dear. It is a hole, which could potentially lead to a vortex.\nPETER: Right, with the operative word being potential.\nWALTER: Yes, agreed, we need proof, and that's where you come in. I want all the data we can glean from that location. Digital spectrometer, radiological survey meter -- we need to track any irregularities.\nPETER: Walter, this is still hypothetical.\nWALTER: Peter, I know that this is not exactly precise science. Perhaps you'd prefer that I put Olivia into a heightened state of fear and anxiety in the hopes that she may get a glimmer from the other side.\nPETER: That's not what I meant.\nASTRID: Here's your seismograph.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, Astrid. Okay, Walter, we're gonna go set this up at the Rosencrantz. If any seismic activity happens, you'll be the first to know.\nWALTER: Uh, yes. Thank you! Please! Hocus pocus! Whatever you want to hear.\nASTRID: Walter, what's all that about?\nWALTER: Nothing. (pauses) Do you remember the chemical attack on the commuter bus some years ago?\nASTRID: Yeah, it was one of our first cases.\nWALTER: I want the case file, and I want my lab notes for the case, please.\nASTRID: How come?\nWALTER: Oh, dear god. Is it \"second guess everything I do\" day? Because I haven't been informed.\nASTRID: I'll get you the file, Walter.\nOLIVIA: Okay, the seismograph is online.\nPETER: (on phone) Alright, Walter, we've got everything set up. Well, can't you do that from there? Okay, fine. We'll stay here... yeah, bye.\nOLIVIA: You're kidding.\nPETER: He wants us to stay here.\nOLIVIA: I mean, he knows it's twelve degrees out here?\nPETER: He said to stay close in case we have any last-second calibrations.\nOLIVIA: Do you really think that this is the end of the world as we know it?\nPETER: If it is, there's no reason to wait outside in the cold for it. There's a bar right across the street.\nOLIVIA: Wait, you think that now is the time to be throwing back shots?\nPETER: Who said anything about downing shots? Maybe they got fries.\nOLIVIA: Well, now you're talking.\nJIMMY SMITH: Evening, Missus Merchant.\nALICE MERCHANT: Hello, Jimmy.\n(Merchant hurries to her apartment and prepares for a visitor)\nPETER: (after visiting the jukebox in the bar) Mystery selection, coming up.\nOLIVIA: Is it \"Feelings\"?\nPETER: No. Did I ever tell you about the time Walter did his rendition of \"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up\" for me?\nOLIVIA: No, but I actually love Barry White.\nPETER: He was only wearing his socks at the time.\nOLIVIA: Uck.\nPETER: He was doing The Hustle... there was a lot going on.\nOLIVIA: Okay, that's enough. (pause) You know when you were talking earlier about... what it felt like when you thought you were with me? And you said that it was beautiful?\nPETER: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: I want to know what that feels like.\nPETER: But?\n(Olivia leans towards Peter, and they kiss momentarily, but Olivia pulls back)\nPETER: Olivia? What?\nOLIVIA: I just need to get some air. I'm sorry.\nPETER: Olivia. Look, whatever that was, if you think that it's a mistake...\nOLIVIA: Peter... you glimmered. When we kissed, you glimmered.\nPETER: So you're afraid. Afraid of what?\nOLIVIA: That you were right. That this isn't just about her. It was, but I think that this is me, I think that I'm stopping us. Maybe I am just incapable of being vulnerable.\nPETER: Olivia, come on, you know that that's not true.\nOLIVIA: It must be. I'm terrified, that I can't fix this, that... that this is just who I am.\nPETER: What do you see?\nWALTER: Peter? Are you getting these readings? What's happening?\nPETER: I don't know. I'll call you right back.\nWALTER: Peter?\nPETER: What happened?\nOLIVIA: Who was he?\nALICE MERCHANT: My husband. His ghost.\nWALTER: Nothing. I thought there'd be some radiation leakage from over there.\nPETER: So you're not buying that it's her husband's ghost?\nWALTER: There's no such thing as ghosts.\nPETER: That's where you draw the line? Ghosts?\nWALTER: Belly and I used to argue about this constantly -- what happens to the body's energy after death. William theorized we should be able to capture that energy using what he called Soul Magnets.\nPETER: It's a catchy name.\nWALTER: He said if he were right, he would contact me from The Great Beyond. I haven't gotten the call yet.\nPETER: Well, if she didn't see her husband's ghost, then what did Missus Merchant see?\nOLIVIA: Missus Merchant... when was the first time you saw your husband?\nALICE MERCHANT: You mean after he died? He's been visiting... for a couple months now.\nOLIVIA: Oh. Looks like you two were together for a long time.\nALICE MERCHANT: Almost forty-five years.\nOLIVIA: These photographs are beautiful. Was he a photographer?\nALICE MERCHANT: He liked to pretend he was.\nOLIVIA: Oh.\nALICE MERCHANT: When we'd travel, he'd tell people we worked for National Geographic. Oh, oh, I know that that -- that sounds horrible.\nOLIVIA: No.\nALICE MERCHANT: But that little fib got us into a few restricted but spectacular places. We never had children, so... that was our thing.\nOLIVIA: Huh.\nALICE MERCHANT: We made a hell of a team.\nOLIVIA: Forgive me, but how did Derek die?\nALICE MERCHANT: It was stupid. The fuse box blew, like it always did. And we flipped a coin, like usual. Whenever there was a chore, neither of us wanted to do, we'd flip for it. Derek lost this time. There was a short in the wiring. He died instantly.\nOLIVIA: After his death, you must have been devastated. Is that when he started coming to you?\nALICE MERCHANT: No. I couldn't get out of bed after the funeral. We've been together since we were twenty. He was part of me. Then he was gone.\nOLIVIA: So when did you first see him after he died?\nALICE MERCHANT: A few days after. Around dinner. For a second, I forgot. I wondered what Derek... was in the mood to eat. And then I remembered... he was gone. And all I felt was despair. All I wanted was him. Even if that meant... dying myself. And that's when he came. He came to be with me. When I needed him.\nWALTER: How long did you two live here?\nALICE MERCHANT: Oh... over forty years. Derek owned this apartment. I moved in after we got married.\nWALTER: Oh.\n(in the hallway outside of 6B)\nOLIVIA: Walter, why did you ask that question? How long had she lived here? What -- what does it matter?\nWALTER: Because... if her husband had this apartment, then it stands to reason that her husband's double has this apartment on the other side. Which proves I'm right. The universe is breaking apart at this very spot. That woman is seeing through to the other side and mistaking the other Derek for her husband.\nOLIVIA: Which is why I can see him too.\nWALTER: Yes! And if the fabric separating our universe is so thin that Missus Merchant can see through it... Th \u2013this is not good at all.\nPETER: Walter, I understand why she can see through and I can't, but... how is it that Missus Merchant can see through?\nWALTER: Right now, I'm not interested in how, Peter. I'm more concerned about what happens next.\nOLIVIA: Which is...\nWALTER: Imagine this is the soft spot in the universe... but every incident... weakens it a little more. Until, eventually... a vortex... a gaping hole, that sucks in and obliterates everything around it. Just like we've seen happen on the other side.\nASTRID: Walter, I found it.\nWALTER: Oh. Good. What took so long?\nASTRID: The FBI had transferred the case files to Massive Dynamic.\nOLIVIA: Which file?\nWALTER: The commuter bus attacks several years ago.\nPETER: How is that relevant?\nWALTER: I've been worried about this since we returned from the other side. How we would respond if a vortex opened up here. How we would plug the bridge.\nOLIVIA: Walter, please don't tell me that you're thinking...\nPETER: ...What am I missing?\nWALTER: We would do the same thing as they did over there.\nNINA: The government asked us to analyze this for its military properties. No one had ever seen anything like it before, so there was concern.\nWALTER: With good reason. If I'm right, this has a composition similar to the material that Walternate uses. We need half a dozen of our best scientists. And that... nervous fellow, Brandon.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, let me get this straight. Are you really suggesting that the FBI encase that building in Amber?\nWALTER: Perhaps the whole block. Tell them they can refer to my lab notes.\nOLIVIA: Oh, stop, Walter. I mean, we've seen what the Amber's done to the other side, with thousands of people trapped.\nBROYLES: Not to mention the public reaction. We'd be looking at mass hysteria.\nWALTER: I understand, but how do you think the public will react if that soft spot turns into a vortex? A black hole that swallows up half of Brooklyn. We should get started.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I understand that it's a last resort, but it's a bad last resort.\nBROYLES: Well, you know more about this than any of us do. What's the protocol they use over there?\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, the Fringe Team goes in and, uh, assesses the scope of the damage. Then they set a perimeter. They evacuate as many people as they can. Once the canister is in place, the gas is dispersed, and within seconds, the Amber solidifies.\nBROYLES: I need to run this up the channels.\nPETER: Not exactly how you imagined meeting the President, huh?\nBROYLES: I already know him. He doesn't like me. I beat him at golf.\nOLIVIA: What are you thinking?\nPETER: Well, uh, I understand Walter's concerns, but there's got to be another way, right? I'm gonna access the information that we've got on the other soft spots. Walter still doesn't understand what's causing the incidents. But if this is a new soft spot, then why there? Why that building? If we could figure that out, maybe we could figure out how to stop it.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, let's pull up all the geological reports from the Rosencrantz as well, going back to the first reported incident, and see what we're missing.\nBRANDON: We've narrowed down the parameters based on your notes. And we think this mixture should replicate the compound you're looking for.\nNINA: So how's it going? Walter, are you alright?\nWALTER: For a long time, I've been willing to think the worst of Walternate. That he was an evil man. Willing to use any means necessary to get what he needed. I suppose it made it easy to justify what I did. Now we're faced with the same decision. And I'm arguing that we do exactly what he did. What sort of person does that make me?\nNINA: One who's asking the right questions.\nWALTER: You don't think he grappled with them too?\nBRANDON: The compound is ready, sir.\nOLIVIA: There's nothing unusual beneath the surface. There's no subway tunnels, no major utility lines. I mean, what are we missing? Hey...\nPETER: I'm sorry, um... the woman who lost her husband, Alice Merchant... why can she see through to the other side? You can do it, but only when your -- your emotions are heightened. That emotional intensity is your trigger.\nOLIVIA: Well, she's grieving her husband. That's emotionally intense.\nPETER: Sure, but people lose loved ones all the time. It's sad, but what makes her so unique?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, and -- and why can she only see her husband's double and not her own? I mean, if they both live on the other side, then she should see them both, right?\nPETER: Maybe the other Alice lost the coin toss. She told you they used to flip a coin to see who was gonna have to go fix the fuse. Well, maybe the exact, same thing happened on the other side, but on the other side...\nOLIVIA: Alice died instead of Derek. Okay, well... what if we've been looking at this all wrong? What if this is not about physics, but about people?\nWALTER: Go on.\nOLIVIA: Is it possible that these two people, both grieving for a version of each other in the exact same spot, are somehow causing this soft spot?\nWALTER: Some form of emotional quantum entanglement. Perhaps. \"Spooky Action at a distance.\"\nPETER: Einstein. Two objects interacting with each other even though they're separated by a great distance.\nWALTER: Man had a way with words.\nOLIVIA: So it is possible.\nWALTER: In theory! I'd have to test it. And I'd have to figure out how to do that.\nOLIVIA: Dunham.\nASTRID: Olivia, I'm picking up all kinds of seismic activity in Park Slope.\nOLIVIA: It's happening again.\nSWAT AGENT: South side of the street is clear, sir.\nBROYLES: Move west and merge with Team Bravo. I want an update in five. (to Walter after he approaches) Is that the Ambering device?\nWALTER: I've prepared a remote detonator so your agent won't get caught in it.\nBROYLES: (to his agents) You two, take this cylinder. Place it in the stairwell, then report directly to me, quickly.\nOLIVIA: Sir, uh, I think that there's another option. Short version -- the woman who can see through to the other side, what if whatever freak accident that killed her husband over here also killed the wife over there? And this intense grief that they're both experiencing is somehow blending our universes together?\nBROYLES: You think all of this is because of feelings?\nPETER: Some naturally occurring chemicals in the body are like Cortexiphan, which allows Olivia to see the other side, but only when she's afraid. We don't know how her emotions allow her to do that, but we know that they do.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, is there any merit to this?\nWALTER: There's a chance. But quantum entanglement is a tricky business. I'm not sure.\nTACTICAL RADIO: Sir, we've got a resident that's refusing to vacate. Merchant, 6B. Please advise.\nPETER: That's her.\nWALTER: Pulling her out won't help. Proximity is irrelevant. If Peter and Olivia are right, and this couple is responsible for what we are seeing, then it doesn\u2019t matter if they are inches apart, or miles. The subatomic connection is the same. She needs to break that connection, and let go on her own.\nBROYLES: Well, what do you suggest?\nOLIVIA: We convince her that it's not her husband that she's holding onto.\nBROYLES: And that'll make this stop?\nOLIVIA: Possibly. But before we resort to amber, we have to try.\nBROYLES: If I give the order, I want you two out immediately. No hesitation. Understood?\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir.\nBROYLES: Go!\n(after running upstairs, breaking-in and finding the ghostly apparition of Derek Merchant standing in front of Alice)\nOLIVIA: He's already here. Alice...\nALICE MERCHANT: Go away. I don't want you here.\nOLIVIA: Alice, what I'm about to tell you is going to be hard to understand, but everything that is happening in this building is because of you. Because of you and Derek. Now, you're the only person that can stop it. But to do that, you need to let him go.\nALICE MERCHANT: I won't do that.\nOLIVIA: I can understand how you feel. Okay, Alice, the man you're seeing, he's not a ghost, and he's not your husband. He looks like Derek. He looks exactly like Derek.\nALICE MERCHANT: Then who is he?\nBROYLES: How long do we have?\nWALTER: There's no way to know.\nSWAT AGENT: Sir, the device is in place.\nBROYLES: I want all teams behind the line, immediately.\nSWAT AGENT: Yes, sir.\nALICE MERCHANT: You're wrong.\nOLIVIA: I swear to you. The man that you're seeing, he's from another place. He's from another world.\nALICE MERCHANT: What are you talking about?\nOLIVIA: In his world, he lost his wife too. And she looked exactly like you. He's making the same mistake that you are. He thinks that you're his wife. Now, I know this sounds insane, but all those people that fell from the balcony, they all died because you two couldn't let go of each other. All of this is happening because of you, and you can stop it if you just let go of him.\nDEREK MERCHANT: Alice... Love. It's me.\nALICE MERCHANT: I can hear you. Derek, I hear you!\nPETER: Olivia... I can see him too now.\nDEREK MERCHANT: Sweetheart... I miss you.\nALICE MERCHANT: I miss you too.\nBROYLES: Was that -- that shimmering, was that was I think it was?\nWALTER: Seeing the other side. Yes...we all are.\nBROYLES: (over the radio) Dunham, Bishop, I want you out of there now! Do you copy? I repeat, do you...\nDEREK MERCHANT: There's so much more to tell you. Things I never got a chance to say.\nPETER: I don't think the building can take much more of this.\nOLIVIA: Well, she won't let go.\nBROYLES: (as glass shatters to the street) What's happening?\nWALTER: Rapid shifts in barometric pressure. Static electricity.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop...\nWALTER: It's the vortex. It's starting.\nBROYLES: How do I trigger the Amber, Doctor Bishop?\nWALTER: Turn it on. Pull out the pin.\nBROYLES: Evacuate now, do you hear me? That's a direct order!\nOLIVIA: Alice, you have to listen to us. That man is not your husband.\nDEREK MERCHANT: Who is that? Who are those people with you?\nPETER: Alice, please. Look at me. You need to let him go.\nALICE MERCHANT: How can you ask me? I can't. I can't! I just can't!\nPETER: I know, I know. But you've already had what most of us only dream of. A lifetime with the person you love. Look around you. Your entire house is filled with mementos -- photographs, ticket stubs. Evidence of a life shared with somebody. Proof that what you and Derek had was true and real. And I know that when you have something so real, you'll do anything to keep from losing it. But please, you have to let him go.\nDEREK MERCHANT: Alice, I miss you so much. And the girls miss you.\nALICE MERCHANT: We never had children.\nDEREK MERCHANT: Of course we did.\nALICE MERCHANT: No. I'm not your wife. Your wife is gone. And so is my Derek.\nPETER: We're good up here. Everything okay down there?\nOLIVIA: I know that it's a lot to take in.\nALICE MERCHANT: I'm not sure I'll ever really understand what happened. And I'm not sure it would make any difference if I did. You know... today was something I never could have imagined. But if the impossible is... possible... who's to say that someday I won't see him again?\nOLIVIA: Maybe you will.\nNINA: Walter... the custodian would like to vacuum.\nWALTER: Just a few more minutes. Lovely view, isn't it?\nNINA: You saved the lives of a lot of people today. And you should feel very proud.\nWALTER: No. Today wasn't a victory. Today was a vision of things to come.\nNINA: Walter, now, you don't know that to be true.\nWALTER: Unfortunately, I do. If the vortex had opened, I would be able to seal it. And then there would be new cracks and we would seal those cracks, and those cracks in our universe would beget larger cracks and... over there, decades of research and funding... the best solution Walternate could come up with was this. And it won't be enough. Once the universes start to unravel, there'll be no stopping it. I don't know how to stop it.\nNINA: Well, then... I think you need to learn.\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: I'm sorry, I thought maybe you were Walter.\nOLIVIA: Oh... is he missing?\nPETER: No, he stayed down in New York. What's up? Is everything alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Um... I might be being presumptuous, but, um... I was thinking maybe... (holds up a bottle)\nPETER: Yeah, of course. Come on in. I'll get us some glasses. (toasting) To disaster narrowly averted.\nOLIVIA: Or at least postponed. Peter, what you said to Missus Merchant... I want what you want.\nPETER: What do you think we should do about that? (Olivia leans in and they kiss longer. Olivia pulls away) Am I glowing?\nOLIVIA: No. (takes Peter's hand and leads him upstairs)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Anything?\nLINCOLN LEE: Mm... nothing. All readings are within normal parameters.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That's weird, 'cause Astrid reported a Class Four event at this location, and she's never wrong. Did you check the batteries?\nLINCOLN LEE: Um...Yeah.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Agent Dunham with Fringe Division. I'm sorry to bother you so late. But I was wondering if you happened to have noticed anything strange going on in the area?\nDEREK MERCHANT: No, n - nothing.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. Uh, what about your family? Maybe they--\nDEREK MERCHANT: No, uh, I live alone here. My wife died a couple months ago.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if you do happen to notice something, please call the hotline.\nDEREK MERCHANT: Yeah.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. Thank you so much for your time.\nLINCOLN LEE: Cancel the quarantine protocol. If there was a rift here, it's closed now.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hmm."

Peter? Darling, it's lunch. (finds Peter's note by the bed)\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Peter! (panting) Peter! (panting) Peter! (cracking) Peter! Oh, god! Peter! Oh, god! No! Peter, no, please! (panting) no! Peter, please! Oh, god, please. No! Please don't. Oh, please... Oh, no! Oh, no!\nYOUNG PETER: Aah! Get off of me! You're not my mother! Oh, god! I want to go home! Stop! You're not my mother! I want to go home!\nWALTER: Okay, children, let's begin. That's it. Now, close your eyes. I want you to ignore everything except the sound of my voice. Try to relax. Clear your minds. We discussed that your imagination can take you anywhere you want to go.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: What's wrong?\nNICK LANE: I don't know what Snuggles will do... if we go somewhere.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Just... put him on your feet and he'll come with us, Nick.\nWALTER: Olivia, how can you concentrate if you're talking? Now, close your eyes, dear. Now, concentrate. Imagine this world... slipping away.\nASHLEY: Excuse me, Doctor Bishop. Your wife is on the phone.\nWALTER: Tell her I'll call her back later.\nASHLEY: Well, she said to tell you that she's here... in Jacksonville.\nWALTER: Is it Thursday, Miss Ashley? Isn't Thursday early day this week? Ha ha ha ho! Well, I'm gonna go home, and you can too!\nTEST SUBJECTS: Yay!\nMISS ASHLEY: Okay, guys. Get your backpacks, okay? Ben, yours is in the corner there, And, Jen, don't forget your violin on purpose again, okay?\nWALTER: Where is he? (to Peter) Of course the Dodgers play for Los Angeles.\nYOUNG PETER: No, they don't. They play in Brooklyn, and I've seen them. And the Red Lantern isn't supposed to be green. I've never had a baseball mitt before--never.\nWALTER: Peter, you were very sick for a very long time. It must have confused you, mixed up your memories, son.\nYOUNG PETER: Do not call me that.\nWALTER: Hey, hey--\nYOUNG PETER: I am not your son! You are not my father! And she is not my mother! You are not my father!\nWALTER: Hey, hey...\nYOUNG PETER: Get off of me!\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Hey, hey, hey...\nYOUNG PETER: You're not my mother! I want to go home!\nELIZABETH BISHOP: He's asleep. We can't keep this up. It's making him crazy.\nWALTER: What's the alternative? Tell him the truth? He'd be locked up. These lies were supposed to be a temporary measure. We were supposed to have him home well before it got this far.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: It's been six months, Walter.\nWALTER: Getting him back wasn't as simple as I'd hoped.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You're working, but I'm with him.\nWALTER: Elizabeth, I think this series--\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I'm with him all the time. I can't watch him suffer like this. What if... if you made a device like the one you used to bring him over?\nWALTER: Elizabeth, we have been through this. That would be catastrophic. The texture of the universe has changed from my crossing. It cannot withstand any more damage.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Neither can he, Walter. He is in such distress. He--he looks at me, and he doesn't trust me. I'm his mother, but no matter what I say, he--\nWALTER: Elizabeth, Elizabeth, you are not his mother. He's a little boy very much like our son... and we saved his life.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: No, you--you-- you saved his life. I'm just trying to keep him alive. I won't keep lying to him like this.\nWALTER: Elizabeth...\nELIZABETH BISHOP: It's not fantasy. I can't keep him safe If he doesn't trust me.\nWALTER: Please... Just a little more time. I told you... I think the children are the key. The children should be able to cross over, And when they do, They can take Peter safely home with them. (laughs) he--he can ride on their feet. Just give me a little more time, please.\nOLIVIA'S STEPDAD: Damn it, Olivia. When I say go to bed, I mean go to bed! Don't you run from me! Come here! Get your butt back in-- ...Ever run from me!\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Hey, I'm really glad you got some sleep. Peter.\nYOUNG PETER: Do you really think I don't know that you're not my mother?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Please, can we just, uh--\nYOUNG PETER: You think I can't tell?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Peter, how many more questions am I gonna have to get right before you believe me? We've been doing this routine for two months now. I told you the name of your hamster. I told you--\nYOUNG PETER: You got some wrong.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yes. And maybe that's because you're confused because you were so ill.\nYOUNG PETER: He makes you say that, doesn't he? 'cause he's the one who stole me.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Stole you from where, Peter?\nYOUNG PETER: From the other world at the bottom of the lake.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (softly) love...\nYOUNG PETER: I know that I sound crazy. But I'm not, okay? I'm not crazy.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Peter, let's just, um-- Let's just get out of the house today, baby, okay? Let's just, um, get some air.\nMISS ASHLEY: You look gray, which is not technically a skin color. Another sleepless night?\nWALTER: Yes, I suppose so.\nMISS ASHLEY: Look, I'm not finished with these. I want to organize a subgroup data. So if you don't mind--\nWALTER: There's no need. I have something else in mind. This is not working. I want to separate the children and begin independent testing.\nMISS ASHLEY: Okay, well, any particular order?\nWALTER: What's Olivia doing inside?\nMISS ASHLEY: Well, she didn't have a very good night either.\nWALTER: Olivia, why don't you go outside and play with the others? Olive, what happened to your eye? Ashley said that you told her that you fell.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Running in my house.\nWALTER: Olive, you can trust me. If someone is hurting you--\nYOUNG OLIVIA: I said I fell, okay? I fell. That's all.\nWALTER: May I? Olive, why did you draw this? Did you see it in a book? (Olivia shakes her head) Where, then? Was it last night... when you fell?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You know tulips don't usually grow in areas like this.\nYOUNG PETER: Well, then what are they doing here?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: A professor who was working here missed them, so he imagined a tulip that would grow in this climate, and he invented it. He used his brain and his imagination to turn the world into what he wanted it to be. How would you change the world if you could, Peter? What would you wish for?\nYOUNG PETER: I wouldn't make stupid flowers grow.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (laughs) What would you do?\nYOUNG PETER: I'd go home.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: A couple of more errands, and... then I've got a surprise in store for you.\n(in toy store)\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Peter. Now, listen, Can I trust you not to run off on me? Okay. Go and pick a toy, then. Go on.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Ooh, that's a strange game. What's that called?\nBOY IN TOYSTORE: It's called Joust. [zapping on video game]\nWALTER: I suspect her crossing over was triggered by an extreme emotional response.\nMISS ASHLEY: Her black eye.\nWALTER: So, now we need to design a series of experiments around emotional flexibility.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Hey. I wanted to show Peter where you worked.\nWALTER: Hey, Peter! Hey. Look at that airplane. That's, um... a DC-3, yeah? Aha. The beguiling Olivia Dunham beguiles.\nMISS ASHLEY: Listen, Peter, I was about to go and get a snack. Would you like to, uh, come with me and get something?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yeah, go on, Peter.\nYOUNG PETER: Okay.\nMISS ASHLEY: Come on, let's go.\nWALTER: We've had a promising development. I think young Olivia may have crossed over. And if I'm right and she has...\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Then she can take Peter home. I knew you'd find a way.\nWALTER: Well, I-I still have to work out precisely how she does it. But we're nearly there.\nWALTER: William, I need your help. I have reason to believe Subject 13, Olivia Dunham, has been able to cross over to the other side. But I believe that young Olivia may need to be in some kind of heightened emotional state to access her ability. I'm compiling some recordings on my new betamax. Perhaps you'll be able to see something I cannot.\n(Recording)\nWALTER: Okay, Olivia. You feeling comfortable?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: I'm fine.\nWALTER: These wires will show me how you respond to the tests. I'll just-- Ashley. Uh, test series alpha. I'll be monitoring vitals, theta rhythms, stable neocortex. Okay. [Young Olivia and Walter chuckling] Well, you're doing very well there, Olive. Now, these four brothers grew up to be great warriors. They were very special because they had the power of metamorphosis.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Metamorphosis?\nWALTER: Mm-hmm. Ah... He could turn into... a hawk, watching for invaders from on high. The speed of a cheetah and... the fire of a dragon! (Olivia laughing) Minimal response to joy. Theta rhythms show a slight bump but not within our range.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Can I stop now?\nWALTER: Not yet, dear. You need to keep going. A little longer, Olivia. You're doing really well. Heart rate 140 beats per minute for 30 minutes. No response to exhilaration. (panting) You'll have to start over.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: It doesn't fit.\nWALTER: Try it. Look at each piece carefully. No. You'll have to start again.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: I-it doesn't fit, Dr. Walter--\nWALTER: Try it. Faster. Come on, come on. That's wrong. That's wrong. That's wrong. Concentrate, Olivia!\nYOUNG OLIVIA: No! I'm not working on this anymore!\nWALTER: Minimal activity in the stable neocortex. Anger isn't the answer. Loneliness isn't the answer either. Perhaps fear... show you a movie. It's one of my favorites. It's called Jaws. It's... It's a bit scary, but I think you can handle it.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Um... Sorry.\nWALTER: That's alright.\nASHLEY: Ready to start the movie?\nWALTER: No, no, no. Um... No, let's-- let's take a little break. Let's get that off you. You don't need that. It started to occur to me, William, that fear by itself wasn't the answer.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: [lock clicks] [bells jingling] [gasping] [pounding on door] Walter? Let me out! Please, let me out! [breathing heavily] [pounding continues] [indistinct whispering] Who's there? Is someone there? [gasps] Aah!\nYOUNG PETER: Approaching the building, requesting clearance to dock. [imitates plane engines whirring] [sirens approaching] [sirens departing] [pulsating tone on phone]\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Love, come and get your coat, will you? [more sirens wailing]\nYOUNG NICK: I don't think Olive thought the joke was very funny.\nWALTER: No, I suppose not. There you go.\nASHLEY: Nick, would you please wait outside with the other children? Thank you. Dr. Bishop--\nWALTER: Just a minute, Ashley. We're obviously on the right track. The part of Olivia's brain that let her do this must be the same part that lets her cross between universes. But I'm still missing something.\nMISS ASHLEY: Dr. Bishop, we have another problem.\nMISS ASHLEY: Let's get your backpack on, okay? Good night.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Ashley... What's going on?\nMISS ASHLEY: [sighs] there's been a small fire, But everything's under control.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Ashley.\nMISS ASHLEY: One of the children has gone missing-- A girl, Olivia Dunham. Now, your husband and the others are out looking for her, and I'm sure that everything's gonna be fine.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Okay. Alright. Thank you. Peter, come on. Come inside with me. Peter, will you wait here for me for a minute? Okay. Good boy. I'll be back in a second.\nWALTER: Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Did you find her?\nWALTER: No, we haven't yet.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: This little girl, Olivia. Walter, it says that you think her stepfather's hitting her. I-- \"William, I believe the ideal environment for transition across universes may be a return to her home. The unique combination of love and terror there apparently stimulates a cortical reaction.\"\nWALTER: \"a\"--they are notes. And \"b\"--yes. The unique combination of love and terror does stimulate a cortical reaction that may be the key to her crossing over. And if she is not allowed to return to her home to restimulate the pathways--\nELIZABETH BISHOP: What, you mean to be terrorized again?\nWALTER: Then it could well take me years to simulate the state artificially.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter, you said that this was just a theory. Surely there's got to be some other way.\nWALTER: And if there isn't? This is not about you and me and Peter anymore. Don't you see what I've done? I crept over in the night... and I stole their child. If we don't return him, They'll figure it out, and they'll come after him, After us... I know... Because that's what I would do.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: So you would sacrifice one for the other... This little girl Olivia for Peter?\nWALTER: No. But for thousands of others... Or millions, It would have to be considered.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter...\nMISS ASHLEY: Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for Peter. He told me he's never had peanut m&ms before.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Oh, he's out by the cubbies.\nMISS ASHLEY: No, I just looked there.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: He- Peter? Peter?\nNEWSCASTER: it's been six months since Peter Bishop disappeared, But authorities still have no ideas. The sympathy of the world goes out to Dr. Walter Bishop And his devoted wife, as the entire nation remains aghast at the kidnapping of their only son. Dr. Bishop, the architect of the famed Star wars defense system that protects our nation, and his wife made an emot--\nELIZABETH BISHOP: This isn't doing you any good.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Don't turn it off now. They're about to point out how ironic it is... That the safety czar couldn't protect his own child.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter, I'm serious. You can't keep doing this. You can't keep drinking yourself into oblivion.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Do you have a better suggestion about what I should be doing?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Well, not this.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Should I give up on my son... the way the police seem to have?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Dinner's ready in 20.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I'm not hungry.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: That's fine. You still need to eat. If nothing else, You need to put something in your stomach to absorb all that alcohol.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You said he was wearing a beige sweater. The man who took my son-- you said he was wearing a beige sweater, Not a suit like I would wear.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Walter, please don't do this.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: How did he sound? His voice? I have a new theory-- plastic surgery. There are a handful of surgeons skilled enough to pull off a feat of this magnitude, but the voice... the voice would be tricky.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You know what? Maybe it was plastic surgery... Or an alien able to take on any shape he wanted. We've considered all your theories, Walter, And none of them have brought our son back. It happened. It just happened, and it's inexplicable.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Nothing is inexplicable, Elizabeth. Science is seen as magic by primitives. Something happened in this house, and we have to go over it and over it until we find out what we're missing.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: And how will this time be any different?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I don't know yet. We have to go over it.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I have, Walter. I've thought back. I've gone over it again and again. I have told you and a dozen policemen every detail that I can remember about that night. I've had hypnotherapy to try and recover every detail I couldn't!\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I know. And I believe you... about all of it. But there has to be something we've overlooked. There has to be an explanation.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You fly to Florida every Monday. You work all week, and then you come back, and we do this. This is not a marriage anymore. It's a routine.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Please, Elizabeth... one more time. He's my boy. I can't lose him. I'm so sorry, my love. I know I can't keep doing this. But it's impossible. Impossible he's gone.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I know. I know, Walter. I spend every waking moment imagining where he is... what he's doing. And I pray that wherever he is, he's safe... that someone's taking good care of him... and that someday, by some miracle, we'll get to see him again. But until that miracle happens, I can't break. I need to be here for him. We need to be here for him. But we won't. Walter, we're breaking. Our marriage... this is breaking us. And I can't let that happen. I need you, my love. I've lost Peter. I-- I can't bear to lose you too. Don't go to work tomorrow. Stay home this week. Forget the lab. Forget Florida. Let's put our marriage back together.\nSOLDIER: Welcome back, sir. [car door closes]\nLAB TECH: Morning, Doctor Bishop.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Morning.\nMISS ASHLEY: It's almost dark, and there's still no sign of either of them. I found this. It's Olivia's.\nYOUNG PETER: Hi.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Hi. How'd you find me?\nYOUNG PETER: I guess tulips don't normally grow around here. [paper rustling]\nYOUNG OLIVIA: But... how'd you know I'd come here?\nYOUNG PETER: Because it's the only drawing that looked happy. My name's Peter.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Mine's Olivia. Don't-- be careful.\nYOUNG PETER: I'm not scared. What happened?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: My step-dad did it.\nYOUNG PETER: So... everyone's looking for you.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: [voice breaking] I messed up... and now he's gonna send me home.\nYOUNG PETER: Who?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Dr. Walter.\nYOUNG PETER: Did you tell him... Walter, I mean, about your step-dad hitting you?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: I don't think it'd do anything.\nYOUNG PETER: My mo-- My mom was telling me you got to imagine how you want things to be. And then you can try and change them.\nYOUNG OLIVIA: Do you trust him... Walter?\nYOUNG PETER: You should tell him. You got to try something, right?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: I think I cooled off by now.\nYOUNG PETER: Did you imagine that?\nASHLEY: No, the last time we saw her was before 5:00. We went looking ourselves, but then it got dark.\nPOLICEMAN: And do your son and the girl know each other?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: No. He--he's not from here. He doesn't even know the area.\nMISS ASHLEY: (gasps) Look! They're back.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Oh, Peter! Oh, god! We were worried sick about you. Are you alright? Huh? Yeah?\nMISS ASHLEY: Let's just have her go inside. I don't know what she's going through. I just want to check her. Please.\nPOLICEMAN: Okay.\nMISS ASHLEY: Okay, thank you. Come on, sweetie. Come on. Okay, your step-father's on his way. Olivia, sweetie, we were all so worried about you. What were you thinking?\nYOUNG OLIVIA: I want to see Dr. Walter.\nMISS ASHLEY: Okay, you can see him tomorrow, but--\nYOUNG OLIVIA: No! I have to see him now.\nMISS ASHLEY: Olivia, you can't see him now, okay? Olivia, don't--\n(Secretary Bishop sits at his desk in Bishop Dynamic and watches quietly as a distraught young blonde storms into his office with a drawing pad)\nYOUNG OLIVIA: (upset) My step-father did this. He hits me. That's when I crossed over to the other universe. Look... That's where I saw the blimps, Just like you said. They were in the sky in the other universe. Can you make him stop hitting me... Please?\n(Secretary Bishop studies the drawing this young girl he has never seen before hands to him... never saying a word)\nWALTER: (interrupts his confused young test subject, who appears to have just finished having a conversation with his empty chair) Olive? Olivia... What is it? What's wrong?\nOLIVIA'S STEPDAD: I'm sorry, Dr. Bishop. I hope our little princess hasn't caused you too much trouble.\nWALTER: No trouble at all.\nOLIVIA'S STEPDAD: Come on, Olivia. I've been worried sick. Let's get you home.\nWALTER: Before you go... I want you to understand that this girl is very special to me, and if anything harmful should happen to her, anything to frighten her or make her uncomfortable in the least... I will not hesitate to inform social services... in which case, I have certain government friends who could ensure that you will be facing significant troubles for yourself. Do you understand me? (to Olivia) Dear... You go home and get some rest, huh? And... we'll see if we can figure out a new way tomorrow. Alright?\nYOUNG PETER: I'm sorry.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Hmm?\nYOUNG PETER: When I ran off-- I-I'm sorry if I scared you.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Peter, it's...\nYOUNG PETER: I'm never going back... Am I?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Listen to me. Sometimes the world we have is not the world we want. But we have our hearts and our imaginations to make the best of it. I will promise you this. I will be the best mother I possible can for you. I'll take care of you. I'll protect you. And I'll never let anyone take you away from me... No one... Not ever.\nYOUNG PETER: But you're not her... are you? You're not my real mother.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: You were sick. You were very sick for a long, long time. And I think it confused you. Yes... I am your mother. Of course I am. Now... you go off and wash your hands for dinner, okay?\nYOUNG PETER: Okay... Mom.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: [line ringing] Hello?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Elizabeth, it's me. I know where our son is. I know where Peter was taken."

I woke up, and there she was in my bed. Yoko.\nKEVIN: What did he say?\nWALTER: It was the '70s. What could he say?\n(both laugh)\nWALTER: This is wonderful, Kevin. You getting to sit here all night, Looking at these monitors. What a magnificent job.\nKEVIN: C.E.O. of Massive Dynamic is not a bad gig either. Must be nice, all that power.\nWALTER: It was Belly's intellect made the company great. All I've managed to do with its vast resources is to create a new flavor of cupcake frosting. Bacon-berry.\nKEVIN: Well, not for nothing, But I've worked for Mr. Bell for a long time, And you're the best boss I've ever had.\n(both laugh)\nWALTER: Look at them, moving through the halls. There's a rhythm to it. A cadence. Each monitor is its own movement. All blending together in a beautiful symphony. What's in that room there? No one ever goes in there.\nKEVIN: You know what that is, don't you? That's William Bell's office.\nNINA: Walter, what are you doing?\nWALTER: I have spent the last two hours in Belly's old office. I found the most amazing things. Animal ESP, morality detector, viral dreaming, powdered water, some of our best ideas.\nNINA: Walter, why are you going through William's old research files?\nWALTER: You know as well as I do that our universes are on a collision path. I have to protect our world. If Belly were here, he wouldn't let everyone down.\nNINA: Walter, you're not letting anyone down.\nWALTER: William would have worked out what the machine does and how it relates to Peter. And to make matters worse, for the first time since we've been reunited, Peter is truly happy.\nNINA: Oh? How so?\nWALTER: Peter and Olivia. I thought you knew. They're a couple now.\nNINA: Wow, well, that's wonderful.\nWALTER: Yes, it is. And his happiness is a constant reminder of the price of my failure, of what will be lost if I don't succeed. And I sat there, and... looking at these, feeling depressed, missing my old friend, wondering if I could succeed without him, thinking how good we were together. But then I remembered how good we were together. And then I realized that maybe these contained a solution. Maybe if I went through these files, Every detail, every thought pattern, Then maybe I could remember how to think the way I used to, the way we used to. Back when there were no limitations. Back when anything was possible.\n(two men climbs up the building. Bill puts on an upside down boots and walks away. Bill takes off his mask.)\nBILL: Come on, come on! Let's go!\n(Koenig drags the rope. camera pans upside down.)\nSECURITY GUARD: Hey!\nBILL: Koenig! Come on!\nSECURITY GUARD: Let me see your hands!\n(Koenig reaches his pocket. security guard shoots. Bill flees. blood floats upward, followed by Koenig's body.)\nSECURITY GUARD: Oh, my god.\nPETER: Trial seven. March Fifteenth. Initial testing on the memory discs I retrieved from the shape-shifters revealed no information, however, the daisy chain wiring pattern seems to have activated them, somehow revealing tons of previously undetected data. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea how the hell to read it. (answers ringing phone) Hey.\nOLIVIA: I thought you were gonna sleep in.\nPETER: I thought you were gonna let me sleep in.\nOLIVIA: Well, I woke up early and it's actually warm outside. And there's this great Street Fair on Memorial Drive.\nPETER: You like a Street Fair?\nOLIVIA: I love a good Street Fair. And you're not so bad yourself. So I figured because you're on the way--\nPETER: Actually, I'm not home right now.\nOLIVIA: Oh.\nPETER: Yeah, I got up early and went to the gym.\nOLIVIA: Oh, well, I wouldn't want to interrupt your workout.\nPETER: No, no, I'm almost done. Just let me shower up, and I'll meet you in fifteen.\nOLIVIA: Perfect. I'll swing by the house.\nPETER: Bye. (beep)\nHANDS-FREE PHONE: Please say a command.\nOLIVIA: Read text.\nHANDS-FREE PHONE: I need you and the Bishops.\nWALTER: It's magical. \"They glanced up and saw Icarus float through the sky, and taking him for a god, They stood still in wonder.\"\nBROYLES: Icarus had wings. We have no idea what's keeping him up there. He was shot by a security guard early this morning. The guard said he found two of them coming down from the roof. There's no alarm on the upper windows. Apparently they used their ability to get up there.\nWALTER: What a marvelous way to pilfer.\nOLIVIA: So the other one got away?\nWALTER: Ooh. (checks his pulse. giddy chuckling.) This man is dead. Assuming he is a man.\nSECURITY GUARD: I thought I saw him reach for a gun so I shot him, and then he just floated away.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so the other one, the one who got away, is this what he looked like?\nSECURITY GUARD: Yeah, but his hair was longer.\nBROYLES: Any idea what they were after?\nSECURITY GUARD: We've been through most of the precious metals already, the gold, the platinum. Doesn't look like anything was taken.\nOLIVIA: I mean, they went to a lot of trouble to get in here. So they must have been after something.\nFBI TECHNICIAN: Agent Broyles. We found a key card on the dead man.\nBROYLES: This used in the building?\nSECURITY GUARD: No, we're still old-fashioned bolt and key.\nBROYLES: Contact the manufacturer. Let's find out what door it unlocks.\nFBI AGENT: Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: You got something?\nFBI AGENT: We know what the thieves took.\nPETER: Well... I think I know how they achieved counterbalance. The boots are weighted.\nWALTER: Hold steady, you infernal creature.\nPETER: So still thinking he's not human, Walter?\nWALTER: Mustn't rule anything out.\nPETER: Huh, that's odd. Those calf muscles are extremely atrophied.\nWALTER: You don't utilize muscles when you float. Astronauts in space lose 5% of their body mass a week. Of course, deterioration like this, he would have had to be weightless for some time.\nPETER: But the chest and shoulders are all perfectly normal. Wouldn't that affect the entire body?\nWALTER: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Hey, do you guys know anything about osmium?\nPETER: Uh, it's a metal, durable. Used in electrical contacts and fountain pen nibs. Why?\nOLIVIA: Well, the warehouse is missing a substantial quantity. So I think maybe that's what our thieves were after.\nPETER: Well, that's weird though bec-- because osmium isn't all that valuable.\nWALTER: No, but it's ironic. Osmium is twice as dense as lead. It's the heaviest element on earth. It's like using balloons to steal bowling balls.\nDOCTOR KRICK: that would require that the cockpit be resistant to radiation at higher altitudes, no?\nSCOTT WATTS: Mm-hmm.\nDOCTOR KRICK: So why don't we try to blend it with a slightly denser compound?\nSCOTT WATTS: Do you have anything in mind? Doctor Krick?\nDOCTOR KRICK: I'm sorry, Scotty. Give me a minute, will you? (to Bill) What are you doing here?\nBILL: Koenig is dead. There was a guard. He shot him.\nDOCTOR KRICK: His body?\nBILL: I left it. I had to. What do we do?\nDOCTOR KRICK: Go home. I'll figure something out.\nBILL: There's something else. I've been nauseous. And my head is killing me. I didn't feel like this the last time.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Did you get what I asked for? Not here, not here. Go to the lab. Wait for me there.\nSCOTT WATTS: Is everything okay?\nDOCTOR KRICK: Yeah, everything's fine.\nPETER: So what exactly am I looking for here?\nWALTER: Anything related to gravity. I think I remember seeing a file on floaters in there. Of course, it could have been from the period when Belly was in search of the perfect bowel movement.\nASTRID: Charming.\nWALTER: Everybody poops, dear.\nPETER: Personal floatation devices?\nWALTER: Read that one to me.\nPETER: \"the balloon is to be swallowed and then inflated with helium via a tube inserted into the subject's--\"\nWALTER: Yes, we never really did solve that design issue. I suspect that's why we didn't get many volunteers. And no helium in the blood works and no indication of anything gaseous, hydrogen, methane. Now this is interesting. His white blood cell count is low. He's got a weakened immune system. Perhaps what's making him float is attacking his body's defenses.\nPETER: Well, whatever it is, I think the effects are wearing off.\nOLIVIA: Hey. Any news on the second subject?\nASTRID: So far he is not in the system.\nPETER: So what'd you find?\nOLIVIA: Well, the key card that we found on the balloon man, the manufacturer traced it to a warehouse in Allston.\nPETER: Perfect. Let's take a ride.\nWALTER: Hmm.\nPETER: What's up?\nWALTER: Nothing. When your mother and I were courting, we used to take long walks in the park. But I can see for your generation that a drive to a warehouse would be just as enchanting.\nPETER: Right. Call us if you learn anything.\n(Krick walks into the warehouse. scans his keycard. lock releases, stops by Bill)\nBILL: What's happening to me?\nDOCTOR KRICK: Oh, no.\nBILL: I don't understand. You said if I got more of that stuff that it would be permanent.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Yes, I'm working on that.\nBILL: Then why am I getting sick?\nDOCTOR KRICK: You can't defy gravity without consequences. That's the problem. You're a pioneer. Men like you, Your participation in this experiment will help me discover a way to eliminate the side effects. I believe we may be just about there.\nWALTER: Doesn't make any sense. There's nothing here that would alter body density.\n(floating corpse falls down)\nWALTER: 2:35, Astrid!\nASTRID: Walter, I'm right here.\nWALTER: Pick him up and put him on a table. The body has dropped three feet in the last half hour.\nASTRID: Like a dying balloon.\nWALTER: Have you ever seen a balloon lose its buoyancy so quickly? No, no, no, no. Something is eluding me.\n(Astrid attempts to lift the body)\nASTRID: Walter, I can't--\nWALTER: I don't expect you to solve it, dear. It's a very difficult problem.\nASTRID: No, I mean-- I mean him. He's too heavy.\nWALTER: (takes a deep sigh and attempts to lift the body) Dear god. He weighs a ton. What--\nASTRID: What is it?\nWALTER: Take another sample of his blood. Run a test for osmium.\nASTRID: Well, you think that-- Why would that make him float?\nWALTER: It can't, of course. That's what's troubling me.\nPETER: Your turn now.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I got one.\nPETER: Okay.\nOLIVIA: You know when we're watching tv and you start to rub my back, and you're not really paying attention 'cause you're kind of distracted?\nPETER: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: And you turn your hand in a circle just over and over and over and--\nPETER: I wouldn't say that's exactly how it is, but yes, I know what you're talking about.\nOLIVIA: It's kinda like you're burrowing through the muscle right into the bone.\nPETER: Okay, I think I get the point.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I don't like it.\nPETER: Really? I had no idea. Alright, no more burrowing.\nOLIVIA: See, I love this full disclosure. Why didn't we make this agreement earlier?\nPETER: Well, it's supposed to be about how we feel about each other but--\nOLIVIA: No, it's about everything. Why? You holding out on me?\nPETER: No, no, no, I'm just clarifying.\nOLIVIA: It's about trust. So it's a great game if two people are playing. (Peter chuckles) Uh, Doyle Street. Just turn left here.\n(a chopped foot falls down. Krick rubs the chopped leg to get some tissue sample. at the laptop screen, agents accessing his warehouse. Olivia and Peter goes into warehouse and finds a corpse suspended by chains.)\nPETER: Looks like we found the second thief.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, and I think there's a third. Unless he did that to himself.\n(metal clanking at nearby freezer. Peter switches on the light. more corpse at the freezer.)\nWALTER: These bodies were dissected, but that's not what killed them. It was the high concentration of osmium in their blood. They all have toxic levels.\nOLIVIA: What kind of exposure would lead to that?\nWALTER: Injection via syringe.\nPETER: But then why cut up the bodies?\nWALTER: Tissue samples, I suspect. Looks like an attempt at an autopsy.\nOLIVIA: So how could injecting someone with the world's heaviest element make them float?\nWALTER: It shouldn't have. It runs contrary to the laws of nature.\nPETER: So how's that possible?\nWALTER: I don't know. Do I look like I have answers?\nBROYLES: I have a few. There are eight wheelchairs in total. One of the unis found them. We I.D.ed a few of the bodies. Those men suffered from muscular dystrophy. They'd been handicapped for years.\nWALTER: Of course. A variation that primarily affects leg muscles. Simple. That's why their chest and arms were healthy. The weightlessness didn't cause the atrophy. The disease did. How could I have missed that?\nOLIVIA: So why target these people? Does it have something to do with the disease?\nPETER: Well, they'd be eager volunteers. They were confined to wheelchairs for years. How could they pass up an opportunity to fly? That's a deal with the devil nobody would pass up.\n(men in wheelchair playing a rugby game)\nMICHAEL: Oh! Stu! (throwing the ball)\nCOACH: Michael, Michael, heads up. Nice. Go! Oh! Go, Michael. Go, go, go, go, go. Yes! Time, ref, time. Let's go. Bring it in, guys.\n(Michael has to ball and goes straight to the goal. whistle blows.)\nDOCTOR KRICK: That was a hell of a play you made. I'm impressed.\nMICHAEL: (takes a drink) These newbies don't know how to play defense.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Is that right?\nMICHAEL: Yeah.\nDOCTOR KRICK: No \"D\"?\nMICHAEL: No \"D\".\nCOACH: Michael.\nMICHAEL: Yeah.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Go get 'em.\n(whistle blows. Krick sits and finds a boy in the wheelchair watching the game.)\nDOCTOR KRICK: Hey. Tough sport, huh?\nVINCE: Brutal. Must be quite a rush.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Why aren't you out there?\n(the game continues on)\nVINCE: Never been healthy enough to play.\nDOCTOR KRICK: But you wish you could though, don't you?\nVINCE: I wish a lot of things. But I stopped believing in leprechauns and miracles a long time ago.\nDOCTOR KRICK: What if I told you I could give you a miracle?\nASTRID: What is it?\nWALTER: Osmium. From the dead men's blood in solid form. I had the morgue send me over the corpses' blood so I could isolate it. Speaking of which, perhaps you could dispose of the excess.\nASTRID: I went to Quantico for this?\nOLIVIA: So all the victims had different doctors?\nPETER: And different insurance carriers.\nOLIVIA: They must have something in common outside their disease, something that makes them easy targets for whoever it is that's doing this.\nPETER: You want to get a pizza?\nOLIVIA: I don't think Regina's delivers this late.\nPETER: No, it doesn't. I was thinking maybe we could go get it. You look like you could use a break, And I definitely could. We'll take the files in the car, come on.\nOLIVIA: I gotta eat, right?\nPETER: Excellent. (to Astrid and Walter) Hey, guys, we're going on a pizza run. You want anything?\nWALTER: Mmm, just some licorice.\nASTRID: I'll get you some from the machine, Walter. And no thanks, I think I just lost my appetite.\nPETER: Fair enough. We'll see you in a bit. This smiling is kinda freaking me out, right?\nOLIVIA: Oh, don't look now. (to Nina) Hello, Nina. What you doing here?\nNINA: Oh, I just came by to drop off a file that Peter requested from Massive Dynamic. But please, do not let go of a beautiful woman's hand on my account.\nPETER: Walter told you, didn't he?\nNINA: Yes, and he's very pleased. As am I.\nOLIVIA: So what's the file about?\nPETER: I'm just doing some research on shape-shifters.\nOLIVIA: Oh, I didn't realize. Anything in particular?\nPETER: No, just background.\nOLIVIA: It's Broyles. I'll be right back. Dunham.\nNINA: I must say, I think you have made a very wise decision to go forward. You deserve to be happy. Both of you.\nWALTER: No, no, no, this is simply not possible!\nASTRID: Well, I got more bad news. They're out of licorice. But I got you some mints.\nWALTER: Whoever enabled these people to float is altering the basic properties of osmium, making the heaviest element lighter than air. He's defied physics. Our entire universe exists in a delicate state of equilibrium, hmm? And we know what happens if that balance is upset. It could cause a chain reaction. He's messing with the fundamental constants of our world! It could lead to chaos.\nASTRID: Ahh! Walter!\nNINA: I don't imagine you're preparing for a science fair.\nWALTER: I'll get a mop.\nASTRID: No, I'll get a mop.\nNINA: Good to see you, Astrid. (to Walter) Walter, what is it?\nWALTER: I need Belly. I need his help. I can't do this alone. This case, Peter... I'm failing, Nina.\nNINA: Walter--\nWALTER: I know he's dead, I know that. But maybe we can bring him back. Look, one of his research projects. He posits here that a person's soul or consciousness continues to live on after death. And all it needs is a vessel or a host to return to.\nNINA: Yes, I remember. It was one of William's more extreme flights of fancy.\nWALTER: All he'd need to do was to prepare someone by inserting a microscopic soul magnet inside them. And he proposes using injections, food, or a cup of tea--\nNINA: Walter--\nWALTER: What if he did it? What if he's done it? What if he's done it, Nina? What if he's done it? Then all we have to do is to figure out how to trigger the magnets to summon the soul back into the host, and he'll be back here with us. He cut out parts of my brain, Nina. I don't think I'm capable.\nNINA: Walter, it was never your intellect that made you exceptional. You're brilliant, of course. But it was your imagination, your boundless creativity. Yes, you're not quite whole, Walter. But the best parts of you remain. So focus on that.\nWALTER: What if I fail?\nNINA: You won't fail, Walter.\nWALTER: How can you be so sure?\nNINA: Because you can't.\n(Krick draws in silver liquid into the syringe.)\nDOCTOR KRICK: Alright, just like that. (injects the liquid into Vince's arm) There. All done.\nVINCE: (exhales) That's it?\nDOCTOR KRICK: Yeah.\nVINCE: I don't feel anything. Are you su-- (gasps) Oh, my god! Oh, my god! (starts to bring his body up)\nDOCTOR KRICK: Good. You're standing. Now walk. Go on. You can do it.\nVINCE: I can walk. (starts moving forward by tiptoe. he laughs.)\nDOCTOR KRICK: You can do much more than that, Vince.\nVINCE: (continues to laugh while floating on air) oh, my god! This is amazing!\nDOCTOR KRICK: Easy, easy, easy.\nVINCE: Oh...Okay.\nDOCTOR KRICK: You'll have plenty of time for that later. Okay...Okay. What are you, about a size 12?\nVINCE: Yeah, why?\nDOCTOR KRICK: Here. (provides a pair of boots) These'll keep you grounded. It's very important that you wear these when you're outside. Without a tether, you'll just keep floating up into the atmosphere.\nVINCE: I don't know how to thank you.\nDOCTOR KRICK: You don't have to. I just wish I had enough to make it permanent. Unfortunately, that was the last of my treatments. I don't have the stuff I need to make another batch.\nVINCE: How do we get more?\nWALTER: Nina was right. I just had to get creative. (sprays liquid nitrogen to the metal)\nASTRID: Walter, how is liquid nitrogen melting metal?\nWALTER: Whoever's doing this has reversed the laws of physics. Up is down. Left is right. And hot is cold.\nASTRID: So cold temperatures will melt the element instead of heat.\nWALTER: Correct, my dear. (stops spraying liquid nitrogen)\nASTRID: What's that white stuff?\nWALTER: It appears... The osmium was mixed with another element. A mystery element. Call Peter and Olivia. Tell them to come right over. We have something to show them.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Ready, Michael?\nMICHAEL KRICK: Right. Ohh... Thank you.\nDOCTOR KRICK: And one... two.\nMICHAEL KRICK: You going somewhere, dad?\nDOCTOR KRICK: Oh, I've got some work to do back at the office.\nMICHAEL KRICK: It's nearly midnight.\nDOCTOR KRICK: It's just this new project. It is keeping me busy.\nMICHAEL KRICK: You push yourself too hard, dad.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Yeah. (takes a deep sigh) I'm close to something big, Michael. A breakthrough that'll change everything. Change lives. But the answer is just out of my reach.\nMICHAEL KRICK: You'll get there, dad. I know you will. You've never failed before and... You won't fail this time.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Good night, kiddo.\nMICHAEL KRICK: Night, dad.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Michael.\nMICHAEL KRICK: Yeah.\nDOCTOR KRICK: See you in the morning.\nWALTER: Lutetium. It was mixed with the osmium.\nPETER: Lutetium is dense, Walter. Extremely dense, just like osmium.\nWALTER: Correct. Two shouldn't even be able to form a molecule, Let alone one that would make a human being float.\nOLIVIA: So Walter, is this other element as rare as the osmium?\nWALTER: Yes. Very rare.\nPETER: What are you thinking?\nOLIVIA: Well, if it's rare, then he's probably got a limited supply.\nPETER: Meaning he's gonna have to get some more.\nOLIVIA: So Walter, whereabouts in Boston would he be able to acquire lutetium?\nWALTER: It's mainly found in meteorites. Do you think the perpetrator's from outer space?\nOLIVIA: Um, probably not.\nPETER: Where do you think we could find it on earth, Walter?\nWALTER: Well, he'd need several samples, so somewhere where there's an abundance of meteorites.\nASTRID: The museum of science.\nWALTER: The museum of science has an excellent astronomy wing.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna call Broyles.\n(enters through the skylight. floating down to the museum. lets go off the flashlight.)\nVINCE: Whoa-oa-oa!\nBROYLES: BPD's sending a unit to sit on the museum.\nOLIVIA: Good. How's security?\nBROYLES: According to the curator, There's a night watchman on duty, And all the wings are individually locked from the inside. Seems pretty solid.\nPETER: Not solid enough.\n(the floating boy opens the lock from the inside)\nDOCTOR KRICK: You sure you disabled the alarm?\nVINCE: I did exactly what you told me. The way we practiced.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Come on. We don't have much time.\nNIGHT WATCHMAN: If we were being robbed, I'd know. We got cameras on all the doors.\nPETER: They didn't come in through the doors.\nVINCE: You almost done?\nDOCTOR KRICK: (scanning the meteorites) Almost.\nVINCE: Somebody's coming. Well, hurry up!\nBROYLES: Get that door open now!\nDOCTOR KRICK: Come on! Let's go! (runs off)\nVINCE: Wait, you can't just leave me! I need your help! (takes off his belt tether)\nOLIVIA: Hey! Stop! (shoots at the door) Turn around.\nVINCE: Help me! It's slipping. I can't hold on!\n(Peter runs up, jumps into Vince, holds him down)\nMICHAEL KRICK: Dad, nobody will tell me what is going on.\nDOCTOR KRICK: I hurt some people, Michael.\nMICHAEL KRICK: What--\nDOCTOR KRICK: I was trying to help them. I wanted to fix them. They were in wheelchairs like you. I know I should have told you sooner. Maybe if I had, it never would have come to this. I did it for you, Michael. When it was perfected, I was gonna give it to you.\nMICHAEL KRICK: Is that how you see me? As something that you need to fix?\nDOCTOR KRICK: No, no. No. Of course not. I just wanted you to be happy.\nMICHAEL KRICK: I was happy. I went to bed at night knowing I had a father who loved me.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Michael. Michael.\nWALTER: (after the others have left) Daedalus crafted wings for his son Icarus so he could fly away. So that he could be free. The wings he gave him wound up killing his son.\nDOCTOR KRICK: Suppose that makes me a lucky man then.\nWALTER: Other parents weren't so fortunate. I need to know how you did it. How did you defy the laws of physics?\nDOCTOR KRICK: I work in aeronautics. A few months ago, I was contracted to develop a new alloy for military aircraft -- a metal dense enough to keep pilots safe from ground fire, but still allow for flight. I wasn't having much success, and then I combined two elements, rare elements.\nWALTER: Osmium and Lutetium.\nDOCTOR KRICK: And that's when it happened. I'd combined two of the densest elements on earth, and somehow the result was a new molecule... a molecule lighter than air.\nWALTER: And that's it?\nDOCTOR KRICK: It should never have worked. It was an accident. A miracle.\nNINA: Oh. Walter.\nWALTER: I know what made the men float.\nNINA: Oh, yes. I heard that an arrest had been made. You found the man responsible, I take it.\nWALTER: There is a man in custody, but Doctor Krick is not the man responsible. I am. Doctor Krick's serum should never have worked. This man wasn't changing the fundamental laws of nature. I think they were changing on their own. I think he took advantage of it. Don't you see, Nina? Our universe is starting to break down because of what I did 25 years ago. What we've seen happening on the other side is starting to happen here!\nNINA: Well, you seem to be taking the news rather well.\nWALTER: Because I finally figured out how to stop it.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: Hey. Thanks for meeting me.\nOLIVIA: Is this why you asked me to meet you across campus and not at the lab-- so that we could make out in front of college kids and not your dad?\nPETER: No. Not exactly. I haven't been entirely honest with you.\nOLIVIA: Oh?\nPETER: Whatever is happening between the two universes, whatever our fate is, I'm right at the center of it.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I mean, we're all there for you. We're all working together to figure this out.\nPETER: Look, I know that you're all trying to help, but it's not your face in that drawing. It's mine.\nOLIVIA: So what are you saying?\nPETER: I've been working on something for a while now. Something that I didn't want to tell anybody about because, frankly, I can't trust the FBI, and as much as I know Walter cares... (sighs) he's too protective. I - I can't trust his judgment. But I do trust yours. But I don't want there to be any more secrets between the two of us... so - full disclosure.\nNINA: (after reviewing the private file he has given her) \"Soul Magnets\"? Oh, Walter, I thought we already talked about this. William is gone. You can't bring him back.\nWALTER: Maybe I can. Belly's notes are incomplete, but I think I was right about the trigger. I think there is an instrument that can draw Belly's consciousness out of its new vessel.\nNINA: (watches as he walks to the ship's bell displayed on a cabinet top) Walter, what are you doing?\nWALTER: And I think... Belly would have left it with someone he trusted.\nNINA: (carries the bell back to her) No. You can't be serious.\nWALTER: A person's consciousness... their soul is energy. And energy cannot be created or destroyed. No matter where Belly's consciousness is, the harmonic vibrations emanating from this bell will draw it forth from whatever vessel he chose before --\nNINA: Walter, you're being -- (as he rings the bell)\nWALTER: (studies her face) Belly?\nNINA: No, Walter. It's still me.\nWALTER: Mm. Of course.\nNINA: Well... what now?\nWALTER: If I'm right... wherever Belly is... he will find us.\nPETER: It's everything we know about the machine, every schematic, every piece of data, every diagnostic.\nOLIVIA: Are these --\nPETER: Memory disks from dead shape-shifters. Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Well, how did you get them? (awkward pause as 'the how' dons on her)\nPETER: They're still working. The information on them is encrypted, though. I thought maybe Astrid could figure it out, but I didn't want to bring her into this. (Olivia stops in her tracks as she hears the harmonic ring of a ship's bell) I've run it through every code-breaking program that I know, but so far I can't break it.\nOLIVIA: (with the cadence of Bell\u2019s voice) That's because the decoder key is in my office.\nPETER: What? At the FBI?\nOLIVIA: (with the cadence of Bell\u2019s voice) No. At Massive Dynamic. (turns from his reflection) Hello, Peter. It's nice to see you again."

She is simply resting.\nBROYLES: what do you mean, she's resting?\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, not exactly of course. Just in the sense that her conscious mind, her awareness, is at a state of rest. But I assure you, she is totally safe. This is all exactly as I planned it. (chair squeaking)\nPETER: You haven't heard the best part. Ask him when he planned it.\nWILLIAM BELL: Several months ago, when I first met Olivia in my office on the other side. I gave her a cup of tea. The soul magnets were in that tea.\nBROYLES: So these soul magnets drew your consciousness into Olivia after you died?\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, after my physical body died. As you can see, I am quite alive.\nWALTER: Indeed. Look at this. Two distinct patterns of electrical activity. This one -- active. That's you, Belly. (laughs) The other one inert. Like the brain waves of a long, dreamless sleep, which suggests that Olivia was aware of none of this.\nWILLIAM BELL: Now I understand that this could take some time for you to get used to. Imagine how I feel. I never realized that a bra was so binding. (snickers)\nWALTER: Astrid, you can start taking the electrodes off her--him.\nBROYLES: How much time? You're not suggesting this is permanent.\nWILLIAM BELL: Oh, no, no. We simply need to find a more suitable home for me to move to. Now Olivia's brain can accommodate my consciousness for several weeks before anything would happen to her.\nPETER: Weeks? Not a chance.\nWILLIAM BELL: And I am confident that Walter will find a more stable home long before that.\nBROYLES: Same question. How long?\nWILLIAM BELL: 24 hours. 48 at the most. (To Astrid) Has anyone ever told you, dear, that you have lovely hands?\nASTRID: Thank you.\nPETER: You're not seriously considering sanctioning this, are you?\nBROYLES: Well, what would you suggest, Peter? If I leave Olivia's brain now without finding a suitable host, I would die. And don't you think that my life is worth an extended nap?\nWALTER: And besides, William can help us understand Walternate's plan, can't you, William?\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: What he intends to use the machine for. And how to keep Peter out of it.\nPETER: Stop. I want to know how we get Olivia back.\nBROYLES: 48 hours to find a new and suitable host. Then I want you out of my agent. Or I'll have Doctor Bishop figure out how to drive you out. Agreed?\nWILLIAM BELL: You have my word, young man. Now I need to retrieve my files From Massive Dynamic. There is a box labeled \"reentry.\"\nPETER: I'll get it myself.\nBROYLES: As fast as possible.\nPETER: You don't have to tell me twice.\nJIM: (thunder crashes) That was fast.\nDANA GRAY: You said I didn't have much time, Jim.\nJIM: You didn't. You don't. (thunder crashes) You were right. It's gonna rain. There is hope in raindrops. Isn't that what you said? What does that even mean?\nDANA GRAY: It means... that every drop of rain holds the promise of regrowth. Each has a purpose. Even if they don't know it. I think we can feel that way. That we don't have a purpose. But we do. Jim.\nJIM: Do you believe what you're saying? About purpose? You said you know how I feel. You said you know pain. And you wanted to kill yourself too, you said that.\nDANA GRAY: Yes.\nJIM: So? What's your reason to stick around?\nDANA GRAY: My reason?\nJIM: Have you found your purpose?\nDANA GRAY: Jim.\nJIM: It's okay. You did your best. I don't believe in hope anymore. All I know is we're all gonna die.\nPETER: Okay, here are the reentry files. You need anything else?\nWILLIAM BELL: Uh, a computer with access to social service and medical databases would be useful. Now the host needs to be biological, able to cognate, but without its own governing consciousness. A human brain would be ideal, but not a prerequisite.\nPETER: What?\nWILLIAM BELL: Hmm. Peter, your father wouldn't want to hear me say this, but even if he does find out more about this machine, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be able to prevent the events depicted in that picture. I mean, that just could simply be your fate.\nPETER: Thankfully, I don't believe in fate. Whatever Walternate's plans are for me, I promise you, I'm not getting in that machine.\nWILLIAM BELL: (chuckles) Son, it is not always that simple. I've lived a long time, Peter. So believe me when I tell you that sometimes when one walks away from his fate, it leads one directly to fate's doorstep. (footsteps)\nASTRID: Hey, Broyles just sent something over that you need to see.\nPETER: Excellent.\nDo it again, and I'll show you.\nHoly!\nASTRID: This video was taken last night just after 10:00 in Roxbury.\nPETER: Nobody could have survived that impact.\nASTRID: And yet she did.\nPETER: What are you thinking, Walter?\nWALTER: Maybe it's not the woman at all. Maybe it's the location.\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter, you think that this is spatial decay, don't you? Caused from a soft spot between the universes.\nWALTER: We're beginning to see signs of degradation on this side.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, it was bound to happen. I'm surprised that it's taken this long. Alright, we need a geiger counter.\nPETER: No, no. We don't need anything. We can handle this. You need to...\nWILLIAM BELL: What? Go to my room? Sit on my hands? The computer is searching all the local hospitals for a potential host based on the parameters that you retrieved from Massive Dynamic. Now I am not someone who can make that occur any faster. What I am is the only person on this universe who has extensive experience in interdimensional decay.\nPETER: Fabulous.\nWILLIAM BELL: Fantastic.\n(agent receives a printout and studies it, realizing something, he runs after another agent)\nND AGENT: Agent Lee! You're gonna want to see this.\n(hands the printout to Agent Lee)\nAGENT LEE: Where is she?\nND AGENT: Boston.\nWILLIAM BELL: We have more advanced ways to detect molecular degeneration over there, but a simple radiation test should be enough to see whether the fabric of the universe has begun to decay.\nPETER: And?\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, everything's within normal range.\nWALTER: Nothing unusual here.\nPETER: So if it's not the place, then it's got to be the girl. Must be something about her that allowed her to survive the fall.\nWALTER: Well, then we need to get to know more about her.\nWILLIAM BELL: DNA. Excellent. (laughs) I'll take the samples from the passenger's side.\nWALTER: Look at this. Me and Belly collecting human tissue And fluid specimens. Just like when we were kids.\nPETER: Glad you guys are enjoying yourself.\nBROYLES: This is Peter and Doctor Walter Bishop, The civilian consultants I told you about. This is Special Agent Lincoln Lee from Hartford. He has some information regarding this case.\nWILLIAM BELL: Hi. Uh...\nPETER: This is...\nWILLIAM BELL: Agent Olivia Dunham. Fringe Division.\nAGENT LEE: What division?\nPETER: So what you got?\nAGENT LEE: The woman who jumped and walked away? Her name is Dana Gray. She was murdered 18 months ago. Two bullets in the head. M.E. said she died instantly. She was killed with her husband and her children in a home invasion robbery.\nWILLIAM BELL: Ooh. That's grisly.\nAGENT LEE: I can't argue. This was a tough one.\nPETER: They ever find who did it?\nAGENT LEE: Yes. We tried to bring him in, but he drew on us. Two agents ended up putting him down in a shootout. So case closed. That is, until I get a call about Missus Gray's body disappearing from the morgue. I assumed it was stolen.\nWALTER: It's a reasonable assumption.\nAGENT LEE: I didn't think anything of it until I saw this. Witnesses reported seeing two people jump out of a dorm window. Cops get there. One body. Grad student who lived there. But the cops find two sets of fingerprints on the ledge during their investigation. Second set, those fingerprints were identified as Dana Gray's. Which is insane because she's dead.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, you know, stranger things have happened.\nAGENT LEE: Um, no, they haven't.\nPETER: Don't listen to him. Her. Sorry. Go on.\nAGENT LEE: Not knowing what to make of it, I flag Gray in the system. Over the next two months, we found prints at three other double suicides. Now security photos show her there, and eyewitnesses report seeing her die. First responders show up, there's only one body, and it's never hers. I know this sounds insane, but I don't think this woman can die.\nWALTER: Isn't this our lucky day?\nAGENT LEE: (opens door, walks along, stops and find a cow) He-Hello?\nASTRID: Hello.\nPETER: What's he doing here?\nWILLIAM BELL: I invited him.\nWALTER: Belly invited him.\nASTRID: That's Gene.\nGENE: Moo!\nWALTER: Come down here. I've got something.\nAGENT LEE: Um, what is this place exactly?\nPETER: This is the place where the mysteries Of the universe get answered. And congratulations. Whatever your security clearance was, it just got about seven levels deeper.\nWALTER: Something to show you. We found two sets of DNA in the specimens we took from the scene. Two different people. But in performing the tests, we noticed something odd in the molecules of Ms. Gray's body. They didn't want to come apart. They were held together by an unusually strong electromagnetic bond.\nAGENT LEE: Um, I'm confused. You're saying that her body's being held together by magnetism?\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, we're all held together by magnetism. Our molecules are like these hematite rocks. (picks up a bracelet) Magnetism is what keeps us from flying apart. It's what keeps us solid.\nWALTER: In Ms. Gray's case, the attraction was almost unbreakable. It's a miracle she left any blood behind at all.\nWILLIAM BELL: (wraps the bracelet around Astrid's wrist) I think it suits you, dear.\nASTRID: (removes the bracelet) Um, but--but how? (buttons up her shirt) I mean, why did she get magnetically supercharged?\nWALTER: Belly, what if she took the energy from her victims?\nPETER: Victims?\nWALTER: The people she's jumping with.\nWILLIAM BELL: Yeah, that makes sense. She absconds with their life force at the moment of death.\nAGENT LEE: Life force? You mean like a soul? Is that even a scientific concept?\nWILLIAM BELL: You know, it's best to try not to be reductive. I mean, after all, every living thing is simply bundled energy. And perhaps Ms. Gray has found a way to capture some vital portion of another person's essential energy and therefore has extended her own life.\nWALTER: Extending her own life.\nAGENT LEE: A soul vampire.\nWILLIAM BELL: As it were.\nPETER: It says in the file that each one of the victims tried to commit suicide previously.\nWALTER: Perhaps simple compassion, Belly.\nWILLIAM BELL: Yes, that's brilliant. She only wants to take the souls of those people that are already prepared to surrender their own.\nAGENT LEE: A compassionate soul vampire.\nWILLIAM BELL and WALTER: Yes.\nAGENT LEE: Oh, boy. Um, who are you guys?\nPETER: Why don't I explain that to you as we go?\nAGENT LEE: Are we going somewhere?\nPETER: If you were looking for victims who had previously tried to commit suicide, where would you go?\nAGENT LEE: Suicide hotlines? Therapy groups?\nPETER: Exactly. (to Walter) Walter, give me a call if you can figure out any more about why Dana Gray can't die.\nDANA GRAY: (crying as she replaces the flowers for her husband and children's graves. as she walks, her phone rings) Helpline. This is Joan. Hello?\nBRIAN: I think I'm gonna hurt myself.\nDANA GRAY: Okay, sweetie, what's your name?\nBRIAN: I'm Brian.\nDANA GRAY: Hi, Brian. I guess you're in a bad place right now, huh?\nBRIAN: I'm tired.\nDANA GRAY: I know, sweetie. Life can be tiring. (sighs) I know. Listen, Brian, I really want to help you, but you have to let me do that, okay? And this is too important to do over the phone.\nBRIAN: You're just trying to trick me. You're gonna send the police to stop me.\nDANA GRAY: No, listen to me, Brian. I would never do that. I promise, okay? Now, sweetheart, just tell me where you are.\nLUCY: (identifies the picture) That's her. Yeah, that's Joan.\nPETER: Is she working today?\nLUCY: No, she hasn't been in for a few days. Is she in some kind of trouble?\nPETER: (goes in to a room with Lucy and Agent Lee) Was she close with anybody in the office?\nLUCY: Well, she was friendly, But I wouldn't say she was close to anyone. She did her job and went home. (into Dana's office) Here's her desk. I hope nothing's happened to her. She's one of our best counselors.\nAGENT LEE: How so?\nLUCY: Well, if there was a particularly challenging call, a person who was at risk, we'd forward it to her. She was amazing. In three months, she saved at least 37 lives. She had an uncanny way of connecting with people feeling hopelessness. I mean, anybody who gets struck by lightning twice and survived has to have a perspective on hope, right?\nAGENT LEE: (gets a look from Peter) Do you have her address?\nLUCY: Yeah. Let me go get it (heads out).\nAGENT LEE: If Dana Gray is stealing people's souls as they die...\nPETER: Then why is she so committed to saving their lives?\nDANA GRAY: (at the bottom of the stairs) Brian? (walks into Brian's apartment) Hello, Brian.\nBRIAN: (sat on the floor, pointing a gun) You're not scared. I know when people are scared. And you're not. Why?\nDANA GRAY: Why are you doing this?\nBRIAN: (drops the aim) You think you convinced me to allow you to come here. But it was me who wanted you to come.\nDANA GRAY: Okay.\nBRIAN: I don't want to hurt people. But I always do.\nDANA GRAY: Who do you hurt?\nBRIAN: I have no hope. Like those raindrops that you mentioned on the phone. You said they have a purpose. Well, I don't like my purpose. Do you think the raindrops will help those people on the train?\nDANA GRAY: What people on the train?\nBRIAN: I don't want to hurt them. But I will. And that's why you're here. You have to save them. There's a duffel bag with my bomb. And that's why you're here. East bay railway train 67. Car 2. Seat 17. (Dana grabs a phone and dials, as the phone rings) Like Azrael, let his angels carry my damned soul to heaven. (aims the gun to his chin and takes the shot)\nMAN ON PHONE: 911. What is your emergency? Hello? Hello? This is emergency services. (puts down the phone)\nWILLIAM BELL: (as Walter smokes) No. Nothing. None of them fit the parameters.\nWALTER: (exhales the smoke) Here either. We're looking for such specific conditions to accommodate your transfer, William. A brain-dead patient like this could be one in a million. (hands the cigarette to William)\nGENE: Moo!\nWILLIAM BELL: (looks at the cow) Huh.\nWALTER: William. No. No. (laughs with Bell)\nAGENT LEE: There's not much in here. No friends, no acquaintances. No one that can tell us where to find her. You?\nPETER: Mm-mm. Just a bunch of books and a receipt from a flower shop for a dozen roses, but she paid in cash.\nAGENT LEE: Hmm. (looks at the box and picks up a book) One of these things is not like the others.\nPETER: What's that?\nAGENT LEE: You never watched Sesame Street? (puts down the book in front of Peter) The Afterlife of the Soul. These other books are clinical.\nPETER: But this one's religious.\nAGENT LEE: Exactly.\nPETER: (picks up the book and opens) All the highlighted passages are about what happens to us after we die.\nAGENT LEE: What's she doing, trying to convince people to jump by telling them how great heaven would be? (the two chuckle)\nPETER: What if we're thinking about this backwards? What if that book's not for other people? It's for her. Maybe she's the one that wants to die.\nWALTER: (with Bell, brushing Gene) Even if we were able to transfer your consciousness safely inside Gene, there are other matters to consider.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, we would communicate through my brainwaves. You would hook me up to an EEG machine and decipher my thoughts.\nWALTER: That may work, but still... I'd have to milk you.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, we could assign Astrid. (Walter snickers and laugh with Bell)\nPETER: Walter? Walter?\nWALTER: Oh, not now, son. We're on to something.\nPETER: Look, if Dana Gray was hit by lightning twice, do you think that would help to explain why she's so overly electromagnetic?\nWILLIAM BELL: I suppose that's possible. The ions due to the multiple lightning strikes could cause her molecules to be supercharged.\nWALTER: And possibly intensified the electromagnetism. Why do you ask?\nPETER: We don't think that she's trying to live forever. We think she's trying to die.\nAGENT LEE: Dana Gray's description just went out over the police bulletin in Dorchester. Somebody spotted her.\n(body of Brian wraps up)\nAGENT LEE: (shows the picture of Dana) You're sure this is the woman you saw leaving the apartment?\nLANDLADY: Like I already told the police, I was making dinner when I heard the gunshot. I came out into the hall, and I saw that woman leaving. Did she kill him?\nAGENT LEE: This is an ongoing investigation. I'm afraid I can't comment.\nLANDLADY: Oh, I see. You're the only one who gets to ask questions?\nAGENT LEE: Thank you for your cooperation.\nPETER: So M.E. says that the angle and wound powder burns are consistent with suicide, but the gun only discharged once.\nAGENT LEE: It only takes one bullet to blow your brains out.\nPETER: Yeah, sure, but up until now, her M.O. has been to try and kill herself either with or directly after the suicide victim. Why?\nAGENT LEE: If she can't die and her soul, energy, whatever you want to call it is bound to her body. Maybe she's trying to go with theirs. Like a hitchhiker.\nPETER: (laughs) A stowaway to heaven?\nAGENT LEE: Yeah.\nPETER: Yeah, but she was here. And Dana Gray, why didn't she just pick up the gun and try to shoot herself? Try to catch a ride?\nAGENT LEE: What changed?\nNUN: (approaches Dana with a book) I think this is the story you were looking for. I'm surprised you've heard of it.\nDANA GRAY: I'm taking a night class, And we're doing an essay on the journey of the soul to the afterlife.\nNUN: Then you'll find this very interesting. The Ascension of Azrael. It's about a sinner named Azrael whose soul was condemned to purgatory. After years of watching him suffer, the angels asked God to let Azrael free. But God ignored them. So the angels went down into purgatory and lifted Azrael up to heaven. When God asked why they did this, the angels said Azrael had suffered enough. And the combined innocence of the angels' souls outweighed Azrael's sins. Finally, God agreed. And Azrael's soul was welcomed into heaven. Good luck with your assignment. (walks out)\n(Dana Gray opens a note)\n(the floor creaks. Broyles takes off the carpet. a secret underground room is found.)\nPETER: (opens the door and switches the light on) Oh. Hello, freak show.\nBROYLES: It's some kind of shrine.\nAGENT LEE: More like a trophy room.\nPETER: So clearly this guy was nuts.\nAGENT LEE: I believe the clinical term is sociopath. But yeah. He was.\nBROYLES: So why was Dana Gray here?\nFBI TECH: Agent Broyles? We found this invoice in the bathroom.\nBROYLES: 20 pounds of plastic explosives. This guy was making a bomb.\nPETER: So where is it?\n(Dana Gray locates the seat, grabs the bag, opens to find a bomb)\nPASSENGER: (on the phone) Okay. I'll pick them up on the way. Yeah, I said okay. Alright. See you soon. (to Dana) My sister. She had another baby. Her and her husband, they're like rabbits. I'm heading to Providence to see 'em. What about you? (on the next seat) Where are you headed?\nDANA GRAY: I'm on my way to see family too.\nBROYLES: Alert BPD and put the bomb squad on standby. Let me know when it's done.\nPETER: Hey, Broyles, timers. (hands the timer) And the wires are stripped. Looks like he was getting ready to attach it to a power source.\nBROYLES: He's rigged the bomb with a time detonator.\nAGENT LEE: We went over every inch of this place. It's not here.\nBROYLES: (to FBI tech) Check his credit cards, ATM withdrawals, metro cards. I want a list of possible targets, any places guy'd want to blow up.\nFBI TECH: Yes, sir.\nPETER: What if you're tracking the wrong person? Dana Gray was here.\nBROYLES: You think she took the bomb? Why would she do that?\nAGENT LEE: No. She didn't take it. I think I know what's going on here. It sounds insane, but here's my theory. She can't die. But she wants to. And she's been trying anything and everything she can to move on. Right? She's been trying to stow away on the souls of the recently dead. Which is why she's been using suicide victims.\nBROYLES: And how is that related to the plastic explosives about to be detonated somewhere in the city?\nAGENT LEE: 'Cause her plan isn't working. She's looking for another way. See, Dana was here when this guy committed suicide. I think that he told her where the bomb is, and the only reason she didn't pick up that gun and follow suit is because she's gonna try something new.\nPETER: So you think she's trying to increase her chances of making it to the afterlife by killing herself with a group of people?\nAGENT LEE: It would explain why she's not here. This woman lost her entire family. She's desperate.\nBROYLES: Even if you're right, That still leaves the same problem. How do we find the bomb?\nPETER: Hey, is this the suicide's phone? (lifs up the evidence, opens up and shows to Agent Lee) Placed a phone call half an hour before he shot himself. Boston area code. How much you want to bet that's Dana Gray's phone number?\n(Dana spots a happy couple. The two sits nearby. Dana's phone rings.)\nAUTOMATED VOICEMAIL: You've reached the crisis helpline. This is Joan. If this is an emergency, hang up and di--\nFBI TECH: She's not answering. Can't run a trace unless the line's open. She has to pick up.\nPETER: Can you change the outgoing caller I.D. on this phone from here?\nFBI TECH: Yeah, sure.\nAGENT LEE: What are you thinking?\nPETER: She may not answer this number, But I know whose number she will answer.\nDANA GRAY: (phone rings) Hello?\nPETER: Dana, please don't hang up.\nDANA GRAY: Who is this?\nPETER: My name is Peter Bishop.\nDANA GRAY: The number that you're calling from, How did you get it?\nPETER: I work with the FBI, Dana.\nDANA GRAY: Well, then I'm sorry, Mister Bishop, but we have nothing to talk about.\nPETER: Dana, please, I know what happened to you. I know about your family. I know how they died. And I know that you're only doing this because you want to be reunited with them.\nDANA GRAY: Just because you've read some files about me, Mister Bishop, doesn't mean you know the hell that I've been stuck in or what I have to do to make it stop.\nPETER: But I can help you to make it stop. The people that I work with are scientists. They are the best at what they do. And if you come in, I promise you they can help you.\nDANA GRAY: Can you promise me you'll reunite me with my family?\nPETER: Can you promise me that killing a bunch of people will?\nDANA GRAY: It's the best chance I've got. I'm sorry. I have no choice.\nPETER: Dana, that's not true. You have a choice. We all have a choice.\nDANA GRAY: Not me. I should have died that night with my family. But for some reason, some impossible cosmic joke, I'm stuck here. I didn't ask for this.\nPETER: As strange as this sounds, I know exactly what you're going through. But believe me, Dana, this is not the solution.\nDANA GRAY: I guess we'll find out soon enough.\nPETER: Did you get it?\nDANA GRAY: (Recorded voice) I should have died that night with my family.\nBROYLES: There. That in the background. Can you isolate that?\nCONDUCTOR: Next stop, Norwood Station.\nASTRID: Here it is. I've got it open. There are three different trains from three different points of origin - that stop in Norwood at this time of night.\nPETER: You sure?\nASTRID: Yeah, the 6:15, the 6:25, and the 6:45. She could be on any one of them.\nWILLIAM BELL: Ask him when they spoke to her. What time?\nASTRID: Hey, when did you speak to her? What time?\nPETER: I don't know. It was ten minutes ago.\nASTRID: Ten minutes ago.\nWALTER: Oh, good. I love word problems. Three trains all passing through Norwood.\nWILLIAM BELL: Each travelling at its own constant velocity.\nWALTER: Not accounting for station stops.\nPETER: What are they saying in the background?\nASTRID: I have no idea. They're doing that thing again where they don't finish sentences.\nWILLIAM BELL: I merely need to insert the parameters based on the train schedule.\nWALTER: That is too early.\nWILLIAM BELL and WALTER: She's on the 6:25.\nASTRID: She's on the 6:25.\nPASSENGER: Excuse me. Can you keep an eye on my stuff here? I have to use the bathroom.\nBROYLES: (sirens wailing) FBI. We need to clear the train. There may be an explosive on board. We think it's due to go off in about eight minutes. (chatter) This is the suspect.\nCONDUCTOR: There are over 300 people on this train.\nPASSENGER: That girl's in the next car. She was right there.\nBROYLES: Bring the dogs in now. I need everyone to stay calm. I need a single file line. Move toward the nearest exit. Leave your belongings where they are. You can get them later.\nDANA GRAY: (sobs) I don't understand.\nAGENT LEE: She's gone. (explosion and screams)\nHey! I've got something. Just down here.\nAGENT LEE: She's dead. So what changed? After all that time trying, why is she able to die now?\nPETER: Welcome to the Fringe Division. Every answer you get just leads you to more questions.\nAGENT LEE: That may be. But it's a lot more exciting than Hartford. Feel free to give me a call If you ever find yourself needing some help.\nPETER: Be careful what you wish for.\nWILLIAM BELL: Hello, Peter. Walter thought that it would be a good idea for me to stay here tonight. I just made a pot of tea. Would you like a cup?\nPETER: Yeah. Why not?\nWILLIAM BELL: So I've been thinking about Dana Gray.\nPETER: You're not the only one.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, I have two thoughts. My first thought is that the energy emitted from that bomb somehow reset the electromagnetic charge in her body and that it was that unique charge that enabled her to die permanently.\nPETER: Okay. That makes sense. What was your second thought?\nWILLIAM BELL: That my first thought is wrong.\nPETER: And?\nWILLIAM BELL: What if, Peter, this isn't about biology or physics? What if what we witnessed was the very reason that Dana Gray couldn't die?\nPETER: Why?\nWILLIAM BELL: Because she needed to be here to save those people's lives.\nPETER: You think it was her destiny.\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, destiny, fate. Jung called it synchronicity, The interconnectedness of apparently unrelated events. I mean, don't you think that it's curious we meet a woman who is unable to die at the exact moment my consciousness seemingly returns from the grave. Now as a scientist, I like to believe that nothing just happens, that every event has some meaning. Some sort of message. You just have to be able to listen closely enough to hear it. (church bells ring) See.\nPETER: It's a church bell. So tell me, what's the meaning? You okay, Bell?\nOLIVIA: Peter...\nPETER: Olivia, is that you?\nWILLIAM BELL: Oh, no.\nPETER: What the hell just happened right there?\nWILLIAM BELL: I think that I may have been wrong. This may be a little more complicated than I first thought."

We'll know by the end of the day.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, you know, if Rachel was a carrier, then...\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Honey, you are a different person than your sister. Nothing is set in stone. (to the physician) Rosa, would you please talk to her?\nROSA OPORTO: Viral Propagated Eclampsia is dormant until pregnancy and undetectable before eight to ten weeks. So until we get the results of today's screening, nothing is certain. You may not be a carrier at all.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. But it's hard to believe that when the odds are eighty percent that I am.\nROSA OPORTO: On average. And, yes, the fact that Rachel had VPE puts you in the highest risk group. It's okay to want to prepare yourself. Look... I know it's easier said than done, but my best advice to both of you is take it a step at a time.\n(Marilyn drives her daughter back to the apartment to drop her off after her pre-natal exam)\nMARILYN DUNHAM: (consoling) Let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a chance.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Mom, you weren't listening, were you? There is an eight out of ten chance that I'm a carrier, and if I am, there's only a handful of cases where either a mother or a baby survive delivery with VPE. So I don't really have a choice. And let's face it. (slight dismay) I mean, I'm alone. My job is all-consuming. My life is hardly conducive to parenting.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Well, what about the father?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, we've been over this.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: You met a man in a bar while Frank was out of town -- Honey, that just doesn't sound like you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (curt) Well, I never said that it was one of my finest moments.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Well, I'm sorry, but I don't mean to be --\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Judgmental?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Judgmental. I-- I just want you to have the support that you need.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: And I do. You and Lincoln should get together and commiserate. He's not happy about this either.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: That doesn't change the fact that you'd make a wonderful mother someday.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Mom... (gets out of the vehicle after Marilyn stops in front of the apartment entrance) Okay. Thanks for driving me.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Are you sure you're okay? I can come upstairs with you if you like.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, I'm good.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Alright, listen, call me as soon as you hear anything, good or bad.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I will.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: I love you. (throws a kiss)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You too.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Bye.\n(Dunham closes the car door and turns and walks to the front door of the apartment complex as Marilyn drives off)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (turns and suspiciously scans the neighborhood before she enters the building. answers a call on her earpiece) Dunham.\nLINCOLN LEE: (calling from the office) Hey, it's me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey.\nLINCOLN LEE: You okay? You sound distracted.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (swipes her access card and enters the building while a bald man wearing a Fedora and dark suit watches from across the way) No, I'm good. (explains herself as she approaches her own apartment) You know, I'm probably just being paranoid. I didn't actually see anybody.\nLINCOLN LEE: But you said you saw someone yesterday.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I - I think so. I mean, I thought that I did.\nLINCOLN LEE: I'm sending over a security detail. (begins typing on his desktop command monitor)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln, you really don't have to do that.\nLINCOLN LEE: Well, I'm your Commanding Officer, so your permission's irrelevant. Besides, if you're concerned you're being followed, there's probably a reason. They'll be there within the hour.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (as she enters her apartment and locks the door securely behind her) Okay. Thank you, Lincoln.\nLINCOLN LEE: Hang tight, Liv. (ends call)\n(Dunham puts down her shoulder bag, then studies a favorite picture. she turns and receives an electric zap by one of the two men that have snuck into her home. she collapses to the floor)\nLINCON LEE: (walking the corridor toward the Situation Room) You're kidding me. You went on a date with 'Bug Girl'?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Oh, you're so smug. You know, at least I make attempts. You don't even try to go out.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's because my new position demands the majority of my time.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Oh, your excuse is smug.\nAGENT #1: (intercepting Lee as he enters) Excuse me, sir, the detail you requested has reached the location.\nLINCOLN LEE: Let me know as soon as they're in place.\nAGENT #1: Yes, sir.\nLINCOLN LEE: (as she walks off) Thank you, Agent.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I already told you. I'm not calling you \"sir\".\nLINCOLN LEE: Alright. Then tell me about \u2018Bug Girl\u2019.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright. First off, her name is Mona.\nLINCOLN LEE: Mona?\nAGENT FRANCIS: It was tea, and, uh, I'm not going any further than that.\nLINCOLN LEE: Why not?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Buddy, why don't you stop focusing on me and just admit... you've got a thing for Liv.\nLINCOLN LEE: (semi-bluffing) That's ridiculous. Although I do think if she was going to cheat on Frank with someone... (thinks better of what he was about to say) ...you know what? It's none of my business.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah. I knew that was driving you crazy.\nLINCOLN LEE: (answers call on his earpiece) This is Agent Lee. (raises eyebrows) What? (grows concerned) When?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (standing with the senior politician) Sir, I understand you have strong reservations. But from everything we know, Peter is uniquely suited to power the machine. And if we fail to determine a reliable way to cross between worlds --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I have already stated my opinion. We are not experimenting on children. I have made myself clear. (activates video call from his Adjutant) Yes.\nMAJOR WARNER: (on screen) Mister Secretary, Manhatan Fringe Division, Agent Lee.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (activates earpiece) Agent Lee, what is it?\nLINCOLN LEE: Sir, Olivia's been kidnapped.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What do you mean, kidnapped?\nLINCOLN LEE: Agent Dunham suspected she was being followed. Security detail found signs of a struggle and her door was wide open.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Has anyone made contact with demands?\nLINCOLN LEE: Not yet, but I spoke to her forty minutes ago, so it hasn't been long.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Have you contacted Echelon?\nLINCOLN LEE: As soon as I heard. They're activating the satellite.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I don't need to tell you, Agent Lee, how crucial it is that this matter be resolved safely. I want information as you receive it.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yes, Mister Secretary. (ends call)\nAGENT #1: Echelon Satellite tracking online. (beep)\nLINCOLN LEE: (on earpiece to Situation Room) Give me some good news.\nAGENT #2: We got her, sir.\nLINCOLN LEE: Where?\nFRINGE AGENT #2: North Moore Street moving east toward the harbor. Speed is fifty kilometers per hour.\nAGENT FRANCIS: (to tactical assault team as they load into a panel van) Let's go!\nKIDNAPPER #2: (to his co-conspirator in the back of their van as they drive through traffic with Olivia) Prepare to make the transfer. Let me know when you're ready back there.\nAGENT #1: She stopped moving. Corner at Mason and Tobey.\nAGENT FRANCIS: (to the tactical squads as they pile out of the van) Box positions. Front and back covered. On my signal.\nLINCOLN LEE: (after searching the area with his tracking device and only finding Dunham's electronic device in the bushes) Son of a bitch.\nAGENT FRANCIS: They knew she had a tracker.\n(a medical team in scrubs and masks transfers Dunham to their makeshift medical facility. they prepare and inject large doses of serum into their restrained abductee)\nDOCTOR: What's next?\nDOCTOR #1: Phase one has disrupted the regulatory process. By now, all inhibitory proteins should be blocked.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (groans)\nNURSE JOYCE: Doctor, she's coming to.\nDOCTOR #1: She's a fighter... Like they said. (as Dunham tries to mouth a few words) Let's put her back out.\nNURSE JOYCE: This will help with the pain. Good. You should start feeling that right away.\nDOCTOR #1: (to the nurse) Let us know when she's ready.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (groggily, as the nurse points a large piece of medical equipment at her abdomen) What are you doing?\nNURSE JOYCE: Just try to get some sleep. I'll come back and check on you. (turns down the lighting and leaves the small enclosure)\n(Dunham is left dazed and alone, to rest. her fetal son is visible on the monitor, and very active)\nAGENT FRANCIS: (enters the headquarters with his superior) So much for trackers being classified. I mean, that was a waste of valuable time.\nLINCOLN LEE: The trackers -- they're organic technology.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay... which means what?\nLINCOLN LEE: They're distinct in every person. And untraceable without the Echelon Protocol. So there's only one way that the kidnappers would know about the trackers. Either this is an inside job or someone sold the information.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (interrupting the two agents) Excuse me, Agent Lee, I was told that you wanted to see me right way.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yes. I need you to construct a database. I want the names and background of everyone that has clearance high enough to know about our tracking protocol.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, sir. In the meantime, I think that you will want to look at this. (guides the two agents into an active computer screen) I've reviewed the traffic for a three-block radius around Agent Dunham's residence. There's an anomaly -- the same commercial vehicle has cruised past her building six times in the past week. The chances of that are 1 in 756,000. It is a clear statistical outlier.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You said a commercial vehicle?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: It's registered to a livery service.\n(the two agents leave the looker)\nHENRY HIGGINS: (in his taxi, listening to a song while enjoying his electronic comics in his portable computer) Yo, he's crazy. (startled by a siren nearby)\nAGENT FRANCIS: (aims a gun to the taxi driver) Fringe Division! Hands on the wheel!\nLINCOLN LEE: (aims his gun) Get out of the car!\nHENRY HIGGINS: Which one is it?\nLINCOLN LEE: Out of the car! (opens the door)\nHENRY HIGGINS: Okay, okay.\nLINCOLN LEE: Turn around! (grabs the driver and holds him onto the taxi)\nAGENT FRANCIS: Where's the Show Me?\nHENRY HIGGINS: It's in the front seat. (the agent looks for the driver's ID)\nLINCOLN LEE: Where's Agent Dunham?\nHENRY HIGGINS: What?\nLINCOLN LEE: You've been driving by her building -- why?\nHENRY HIGGINS: I'm a cab driver. I got fares all over. (quickly gives in) Alright. I was worried about her. That's all! Once in a while I drive by, make sure she's okay. That's not a crime.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright. (reads from the driver's Show Me) Henry Arliss Higgins. He lives on Hastings Avenue. Wife's Jasmine. Daughter's Laura.\nLINCOLN LEE: How do you know her? (the driver plays coy) Don't you push me, Henry. Agent Dunham happens to be a very good friend of mine.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Sure don't seem that way. Not from what she's told me.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You know Dunham.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah, I do. I know you too. This is the second time you've pointed a gun at me. The first was the day I met her.\nAGENT FRANCIS: You're the cab driver from the gas station.\nLINCOLN LEE: You helped her get away.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Well, she... she threatened me.\nLINCOLN LEE: Where is she?\nHENRY HIGGINS: How would I know? I didn't expect she would come back here.\nLINCOLN LEE: What do you mean, back here?\nDOCTOR #1: (approaches Bolivia, checks her eye) Don't move, please. (the patient struggles) Up her to fifty milligrams. That should keep her knocked out.\nNURSE JOYCE: (surprised) Fifty milligrams?\nDOCTOR #1: (confronts the doubting nurse) Is there a problem?\nNURSE JOYCE: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR #1: Good. How's he doing?\nNURSE JOYCE: He's doing very well. (Dunham is worried and confused. looks at her unborn son in the monitor then to his abdomen) Abdominal circumference 160, head 170, biparietal diameter 40.\nDOCTOR #1: Shouldn't be long now. I'll make sure everything's ready.\nNURSE JOYCE: I'll administer the sedatives. It's time for your pill. (takes a pill out of the bottle)\nBOLIVIA: (struggles) No, I --\nNURSE JOYCE: It's for your own good. (holds Dunham's cheek) There's no time for discussion. Now, do I need to call the orderlies or not? (Dunham calms down) Good girl. (Dunham voluntarily accepts the pill) Now, just... relax. (Dunham swallows)\n(as the nurse leave, Dunham spits out the pill)\nHENRY HIGGINS: All I know is she was scared. She kept on saying people were trying to convince her that she was someone that she wasn't.\nLINCOLN LEE: What people?\nHENRY HIGGINS: People she was running away from. You guys, I guess.\nAGENT FRANCIS: So she said she wanted to go home.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah. To some guy. Named Peter.\nLINCOLN LEE: Peter?\nHENRY HIGGINS: That was his name. Look, I didn't want to get involved in any of this. But she... she got to me.\nLINCOLN LEE: And you said after you helped her get to Liberty Island, you didn't see her again?\nHENRY HIGGINS: I didn't expect to\u2026 \u2018til I ran into her a few weeks ago on the street. Only she acted like she didn't know me. Like her mind got wiped. When someone knows you and then all of a sudden they don't... I don't know. I - I got worried. Look, I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers here, guys. There's some things a guy like me shouldn't know about. I get it. But you start hearing things about some other universe... it's hard to ignore.\nLINCOLN LEE: What did you just say?\nHENRY HIGGINS: (on the Fringe Division black car) What about my taxi?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Okay, this is... seriously messed up.\nLINCOLN LEE: He knows way too many details to be lying.\nAGENT FRANCIS: What are you thinkin'?\nLINCOLN LEE: Remember after Liv's breakdown when she came back to field duty?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah.\nLINCOLN LEE: You asked me if I thought it was possible for our Olivia to be switched with the one from the other universe.\nAGENT FRANCIS: And you said I was crazy.\nLINCOLN LEE: What if you're not?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: (walks with her dog and receives a call) Hello?\nROSA OPORTO: Marilyn? It's Rosa. I've left several messages for Olivia, but I couldn't reach her.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Oh, well... I'm sure something must have come up at work. Do you have her test results back?\nROSA OPORTO: Yes. I'm sorry. Olivia is a carrier for VPE. (sits down in a nearby bench) Listen, I'd like Olivia to meet with a trauma counselor here on staff, Beau Amaral. He's wonderful. He can talk to her.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: I'm sure that'll be helpful.\nROSA OPORTO: Marilyn?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: I'm here.\nROSA OPORTO: Tell Olivia to call me when you talk to her. I'd like to schedule the procedure as soon as possible before there's any risk to her health.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Okay, I'll tell her just as soon as she calls back. Thank you, Rosa. Bye. (ends call)\n(the unlucky mother looks at a grandmother, mother and daughter enjoying their time together at the park)\n(the nurse switches off the medical equipment. Dunham picks up a scalpel. attempts to take off the strap. screams of tummy pain.)\nNURSE JOYCE: (presses the intercom button) Doctor, we're ready.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What -- what-- what are you doing to me?\n(something inside Bolivia's abdomen is moving)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (with his back to the agent) And this all from a cab driver.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yes. With all due respect, sir... if there's any truth to what he's saying, it could be a lead. I need to know. Was our Agent Dunham replaced with theirs?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (faces the agent. walks towards him.) She was. Yes. And during that time, our Agent Dunham infiltrated their Fringe Division.\nLINCOLN LEE: I wish I was told sooner.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You weren't told because it was classified. Our Agent Dunham returned safely to our side weeks ago.\nLINCOLN LEE: And theirs?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Sent home. (sits down) I'm beginning to think that... not sharing this information may hinder your ability to find Olivia.\nLINCOLN LEE: What are you thinking? That this all may have something to do with her abduction?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Agent Dunham is carrying my grandchild. It wasn't part of the mission. When she was on the other side, Olivia and my son got close. I believed the child and Olivia would be safer if no one knew the truth.\nLINCOLN LEE: Who else knows about this?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: As far as I know, just Olivia and I.\nLINCOLN LEE: Do you think she could have been taken by invaders from the other side?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I imagine it's possible. Or, if as you suggest... that this could be an inside job. None of us is without enemies.\nLINCOLN LEE: You're suggesting this may be about you?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (leans forward) My son was taken from me, Agent Lee. The notion that I might lose my future grandchild is simply impossible. I will answer your questions. I will give you complete access to Olivia's mission files. Whatever it takes -- find her.\nLINCOLN LEE: I'll do my best, sir. (leaves the room)\n(the pregnant patient is transferred by the medical team to the testing facility)\nDOCTOR #1: How are her ligaments doing?\nNURSE JOYCE: Supple. The chemicals are working.\nDOCTOR #1: Okay. Calibrate the joint expander to eighteen degrees. If her bone can withstand it, increase to twenty-three. (checks blood sample in the microscope) Hemoglobin count six point seven.\nNURSE JOYCE: That's low.\nDOCTOR #1: I agree. It's borderline. (checks Bolivia's now full-blown belly) Utero-placental blood flow is inadequate. Is her pain management on schedule?\nNURSE JOYCE: Yes, Doctor. I gave her the last sedative twenty minutes ago.\nDOCTOR #1: Administer another twelve units of plasma immediately.\nNURSE JOYCE: This will be her fifth transfusion.\nDOCTOR #1: Duly noted.\nNURSE JOYCE: Acceleration at this rate is difficult in the best of circumstances. With her erratic vitals \u2013\nDOCTOR #1: We will take appropriate precautions.\nNURSE JOYCE: I'm not sure they exist. If her body isn't ready --\nDOCTOR #1: We have the timetable. There will be no adjustments. Initiate Phase Two.\nNURSE JOYCE: Have you emptied your bladder?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, I feel really kinda dizzy.\nNURSE JOYCE: Did you empty your bladder?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You're an obstetric nurse. You must feel some kind of calling to do something so selfless. You know, to help women bring babies into the world. I think I may have VPE. In fact, I probably do. My sister and her baby didn't make it through labor. Both their hearts gave out. You cannot be okay with what they're doing to me. If you don't make them stop, then they're gonna kill me and they're gonna kill the child that I'm carrying. You don't have to do... anything. You just have to leave me alone just for a minute. Please. Okay?\nNURSE JOYCE: We're starting the next phase in twenty-two minutes. And believe me, you don't wanna be standing when it happens, so stop wasting time. Empty your bladder and let's get on with this.\nLINCOLN LEE: Whoever kidnapped Olivia knew she was implanted with a subcutaneous tracker.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: All employees with Level Five clearance had access to the biometric tracking protocol. I compiled the database, but without another variable, the list is fairly extensive.\nAGENT FRANCIS: We have another one.\nLINCOLN LEE: What we're about to tell you requires Level Ten clearance.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Sir, I'm nowhere near that level.\nLINCOLN LEE: Concerning this matter, you are now.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: What is it?\nLINCOLN LEE: Agent Dunham is pregnant with Secretary Bishop's grandchild.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Oh, I see. I'll start by cross-referencing agents with clearance with those who also had access to Agent Dunham's medical records.\nLINCOLN LEE: Let me know as soon as you're done. (leaves the two male agents)\nAGENT FRANCIS: (sees Marilyn escorted by an agent in the elevator) Marilyn's here. Did you call her?\nLINCOLN LEE: I thought it was time she knew. I sure don't want to do this.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright, listen, I'll talk to her. You deal with Travis Bickle. Come on. Coppola... \"You talkin' to me?\"\nLINCOLN LEE: No idea.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Alright. Point is, Henry's probably done with his statement. I'll deal with Marilyn.\nLINCOLN LEE: Thank you, Charlie.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yeah, buddy. (leaves to talk to Marilyn. sitting down talking to Marilyn.) We're working every lead. Every Agent in this office, they're doing everything they can to find her.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: How long has she been missing? Hmm? I knew that something was wrong because...Doctor Oporto said she wasn't answering her phone calls.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Who's Doctor Oporto?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: It's her obstetrician.\nAGENT FRANCIS: There's a possibility that... her kidnapping relates to her pregnancy.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: She can't have the baby. There's -- there's no way she can have the baby.\nNURSE JOYCE: You need help with your slippers?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. (slowly takes off her slippers. punches the nurse. grabs the scalpel and points at the neck of the nurse.) You're gonna get me out of here.\nNURSE JOYCE: You're making a big mistake. Help! In here! You can't leave!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Either I leave or you bleed to death.\nDOCTOR: Where is she? Don't worry. She won't get far.\n(pregnant lady runs. thunder clashes. a masked person passes by.)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (continues running. at the window of a restaurant) Hey! Hey. Please, can you let me in? (inside, a lady busy hoovering) Hey! (bangs the door) Help me! Oh! (sits down, grabs her abdomen, screams in pain)\n(Agent Dunham holds her belly and screams of pain. she stands up and walk across the street, passing by a display of chinese clothes store. she stops at the phone booth and picks up the phone.)\nLINCOLN LEE: Impound brought your cab around. It should be waiting for you on B-4.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Valet service, huh?\nLINCOLN LEE: Look, I know you still have questions, but I can't impress this on you enough -- what we've talked about is restricted information.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Ah, don't worry. I'm not talking. Not that anyone would believe me anyhow.\nLINCOLN LEE: (activates his earpiece) This is Agent Lee.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln!\nLINCOLN LEE: Oh, my God, Olivia. Where are you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm in Chinatown. I'm not exactly sure where.\nLINCOLN LEE: Listen carefully. I want you to look around and tell me what you see.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (in distress) Okay. I see a... a dragon. It's red. And there's a noodle store. Listen, Lincoln, I need a doctor. I think... I think that the baby's coming.\nLINCOLN LEE: What?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: They accelerated the pregnancy.\nLINCOLN LEE: Alright. You're gonna be okay.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I need you to speak to my mo--ther! (drops the phone. finds the medical personnel following her.)\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv, what's happening? Olivia, can you hear me? I need a trace on that call that originated in Chinatown!\nHENRY HIGGINS: I know a shortcut.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah?\nHENRY HIGGINS: I'm a cabbie. I know every shortcut. (closes elevator)\n(at chinatown, the pregnant woman holds on to a young woman after being chased by her kidnapper)\nYOUNG WOMAN: What's wrong with you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, God, I need help! Oh! (screams in pain as the bystanders watch her suffer)\n(at Fringe Division, the looker operates her machine while the cabbie and the agent is on the car)\nAGENT FARNWORTH: She called from a phone booth. Canal and Market.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Did you get that?\nLINCOLN LEE: Canal and Market. Got it.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah. We're close.\nLINCOLN LEE: What about the medical team?\nAGENT FRANCIS: They're en route.\nLINCOLN LEE: Tell them she's in labor.\nAGENT FRANCIS: That's impossible.\nLINCOLN LEE: No. They accelerated her pregnancy.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Lincoln. Listen to me. I spoke to Marilyn. There's something wrong. She won't make it through delivery.\nLINCOLN LEE: (arrives at the scene) Fringe Division! Out of the way!\nHENRY HIGGINS: (yells something incomprehensible) Fringe!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh! Oh, Lincoln, I think the baby's coming.\nLINCOLN LEE: Let's get her inside. (carries the pregnant lady with the cabbie to a chinese store. lays her to the ground with her head resting on his legs. the crowd outside watches.)\nHENRY HIGGINS: Right here, right here. Olivia... my name is Henry. I delivered my little girl in the back of my cab. It's not exactly a medical degree, but I can help out until the ambulance arrives.\nLINCOLN LEE: You can trust him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. It's nice to meet you, Henry.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Yeah. You too. May I?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sure.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Now, get your knees up. Okay? Easy. Okay? Nice and easy. (positions the pregnant woman)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln, did you talk to my mom? (holds onto the agent) Oh, God.\nLINCOLN LEE: Just squeeze my hand. As hard as you need to.\nHENRY HIGGINS: You're feeling it like you need to bear down.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Mm-hmm.\nHENRY HIGGINS: That's okay. This baby on its way.\nLINCOLN LEE: You just look at me. You don't think about an hour from now. You don't think about a minute. We're gonna focus on this moment, okay? It's you and me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: God, I'm scared.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Put your chin to your chest. It'll help. Okay, and I need you to push. One, two... Three. Keep pushing, keep pushing. Four, five.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's good, that's good. That's really good.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You promise me that you will stay until this is over.\nLINCOLN LEE: There's no place else for me to be.\nHENRY HIGGINS: That's it. You're doing so good. Okay, you're almost there. Come on, push. One, two...\nLINCOLN LEE: I love you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Promise me you'll save the baby.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Promise.\nLINCOLN LEE: Okay. I promise.\nHENRY HIGGINS: Oh, my God, I see his head! Alright, you gotta go. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going! There it is! There it is! He's here. He's okay. He's okay. (the newborn baby screams)\nLINCOLN LEE: You hear that? (the new mother is unconscious) Liv? He made it.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh... (regains consciousness)\nLINCOLN LEE: He's fine! (touches the baby with the mother) You -- you have a son.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: He's beautiful.\n(at a distance, an ambulance siren is heard. the crowd outside begins to clap. the nurse is just outside of the store)\nLINCOLN LEE: I wonder what she's gonna end up naming him.\nAGENT FRANCIS: She didn't tell you?\nLINCOLN LEE: No.\nAGENT FRANCIS: I'll give you a hint. It's not Lincoln.\nLINCOLN LEE: You don't know anything, do you?\nAGENT FRANCIS: No, I don't. But I had you going.\nLINCOLN LEE: Can't believe Liv is a mom.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Listen, you did a good job, sir. Broyles would be proud.\nLINCOLN LEE: Hold on. Did you just say sir?\nAGENT FRANCIS: Don't get used to it.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Any news?\nLINCOLN LEE: We found the location where they were holding her. Abandoned building on Bayard Street. Techs are there now.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Have they found anything?\nLINCOLN LEE: No, sir, not yet.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I want security assigned at all times. Until we find whoever did this, Agent Dunham and her baby are still at risk.\nLINCOLN LEE: I've arranged for Secret Service. There's an agent outside her room right now.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Thank you, Agent Lee. Your hard work will not go unrewarded. I'll go up and... meet my grandson. (climbs to next floor)\nLINCOLN LEE: Yes, sir.\nAGENT FRANCIS: He should have told us.\nLINCOLN LEE: Which part?\nMARILYN DUNHAM: He's a miracle.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: They said it was the acceleration. That the...the virus couldn't replicate as fast as the pregnancy.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Whatever the science is... he's still a miracle.\nLINCOLN LEE: They put an imposter on our team to protect their mission. And do the math. Olivia, when she came back -- wasn't it around the time Broyles disappeared?\nAGENT FRANCIS: It was.\nLINCOLN LEE: Makes you wonder what else we don't know.\nAGENT FRANCIS: Yes, it does.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: As soon as I found out I was pregnant, all I did was think about whether or not I had the condition. I never actually spent any time thinking about... being a mom. I mean, I... now I just -- I don't know if I'm ready.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: To tell you the truth, all you need to do is love him. And you can figure out the rest as you go on.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm gonna need your help.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: I hope so.\nNURSE: Sorry to interrupt. How are you feeling?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Good.\nNURSE: I'll be right back.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Do you mind if I tag along?\nNURSE: Not at all. You're a handsome little fellow, aren't you? Oh, Sweetie!\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Ooh!\nNURSE: (to technician) That goes to the lab. (to baby) What a good boy. It's okay. It's okay, Sweetie. (to Marilyn) There's your grandson back.\nMARILYN DUNHAM: Oh! Yes! You are so brave. Yes!\nTHE OBSERVER: (on communication device) It is happening.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Why did you tell Lincoln so much?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: He's a good Agent. And smart. The lie would have made him grow suspicious. And I trusted that you wouldn't fail.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: We didn't."

    "Script":"Teleplay by: J.H. WymanJeff Pinkner\n\"Lysergic Acid Diethylamide\" is the nineteenth episode of the third season of Fringe.\n1 Synopsis 2 Plot 3 Notable Quotes 4 Notes 5 Cypher\nBack \"Over Here\" the team battles frantically to extract Bell's consciousness from Olivia's body before her soul is lost forever.\nWalter, Peter and Olivia.\nWilliam bell in Olivia's body.\nThe mind of William Bell still possesses Olivia Dunham's body after several failed attempts to extract it to coma patients. Walter Bishop and William believe that they have less than a day before Olivia's mind will be lost to them all. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan to have Peter Bishop and him enter Olivia's mind to help with the aid of LSD to locate her ego for it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.\nWilliam Bell\nWalter and Peter, inside Olivia's mind, find they stand out as invaders, and the people that populate her mind, including a vision of her stepfather, seek to stop them. Walter finds someone sending a Morse code signal from William Bell's office in one of the World Trade Center buildings. After evading a crowd and a trap set by a false vision of Nina Sharp, they arrive at Bell's office, where they find William waiting for them as an animated cartoon, part of Olivia's mind, at which point Bell brings to their attention the fact that Walter and Peter are also animated characters by this point.\nTraveling by Zeppelin.\nBell, Walter and Peter.\nThe three are unable to find clues to Olivia's ego, something that William thought would be present if Olivia was looking to be found. Peter realizes that when Olivia is scared, she retreats to somewhere safe, and suggests they search her mind's version of Jacksonville, her childhood home. As they travel by zeppelin, William tries to encourage Walter that he no longer needs to rely on himself. They are soon attacked by a man wearing an X-marked t-shirt, who tears open the side of the zeppelin; Walter is pulled out by the rush of air and falls to his death\u2014waking him back in the real world.\nMan wearing an X marked shirt.\nOlivia.\nBell and Olivia.\nWilliam and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to find the home among the military housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes this is not her by her eyes. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego, assured of Peter's identity, and she willingly goes with him and William, chased by the image of her stepfather and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to the possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.\nOlivia wakes back up to the real world, free of William's mind. Walter finds his efforts to store William's mind failed, and takes time to consider William's last message he gave to Olivia, \"the dog wouldn't hunt\". Later, Peter visits Olivia to rekindle their relationship when he notices a drawing of the same man in the X t-shirt he saw in her mind. Olivia cannot name the man but nonchalantly refers to him as the person that will kill her.\nBroyles: I never understood why Walter was so drawn to licorice. But look at it. The swirl... it\u2019s Bernini\u2019s Spiral Altar at St. Peter\u2019s. It... doesn\u2019t end. Astrid: Did you clean that up? Broyles: Yeah. I thought I\u2019d help you clear the table. Astrid: You touched the tray with the sugar cube. Broyles: Sure. Why? Astrid: ...Have you ever taken LSD?\nPeter: (to Broyles) You're bald. (to Astrid) I think he's an Observer.\nWalter: No! No! No! Of all the places to grab a man, you choose the crotch of my pants! Peter: Hey, I broke your fall, didn't I? Walter: You spared me no embarrassment in the process. Peter: Hey, I thought you said none of this was real. Walter: I said that everything is a product of Olivia's subconscious. My feelings are most definitely real!\nPeter: You sure this is safe, Walter? Walter: Perfectly. If everything goes according to plan, I will latch onto the dominant consciousness, which is Belly's, and coax it into its new residence. Peter: I meant safe for Olivia. Walter: Oh, of course. Peter: No offense. Bell: Oh. None taken. Walter: Olivia's mind is still peacefully at rest. She won't be aware of any of this. Although we should all take a few steps back. Peter: Excuse me?\nThe Observer is at the hospital as Peter Bishop and Walter Bishop follow the paramedics in, screen-right, walking to the left. The animated William Bell pours a glass of a 60-year-old bottle of MacCutcheon Scotch whisky after Peter and Walter join him in the World Trade Center. This is a nod to J.J. Abrams' Lost which is also a Bad Robot Production."

You let me know as soon as the Faraday Cage is completed.\nSCIENTIST: I'm told they're almost done. (hesitates) You really think this is all necessary?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: We're standing underneath a giant lightning rod. It's unclear what kind of electrostatic discharge the device may give off.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (steps through the open lab door) Good morning.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (to his colleagues) If you'll all excuse us, please. (to Bishop, after his team steps out) Based on Olivia Dunham's DNA profile, we were able to identify twenty-three chromosomes your grandson inherited from his mother and strip them out. (hands over a vial) Of course, that leaves us with only half of Peter's full genetic profile. But hopefully that's enough to activate the machine.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: How long before we're ready?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: It should be within the hour. Sir, history may never fully know what we've done here. How we've saved our universe. (sincere and committed) I'm proud to be a part of it.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Oppenheimer saved us too. But at what cost? (reflective) He couldn't bear the nightmares... the screams of all the innocents he had killed. \"Now, I am become death, the Destroyer of Worlds.\" Only in our case, that really is true. We destroyed their world to save ours. May God have mercy on us. (returns the vial to his scientist)\n(in this universe... in the rolling wooded fields of southeast New York, a ranch hand approaches the large flock of sheep he is monitoring in the chilly early morning air. the livestock are alarmed and bleating loudly as something unusual takes shape in the nearby woods)\nRITCHIE: (calls on a handheld radio) Hey, Joe, come in.\nJOE: (sitting in his parked truck on a nearby access road. returns the radio call) You know what time it is, don't you, Rich?\nRITCHIE: Listen, you've got to get up here.\nJOE: Six A.M. That means I'm having my breakfast right now.\nRICHIE: (sense of urgency) This is serious. You've gotta get up here. Something's spooking the sheep. They're going crazy.\nJOE: Alright. I'm on my way. (dumps his hot drink out of the window and starts the drive up to the flock. the music from the radio in his truck becomes all static as he approaches. thousands of locust swarm down the road and away from the flock. the truck strikes hundreds of the insects and nearly crashes. after he arrives safely at the grazing field) I just hit a swarm of locusts! It's like the blessed apocalypse.\nRITCHIE: Yeah, well, the sheep are acting like it is. I tried to round 'em up, get 'em back to the barn, but they won't budge.\nJOE: (a strong wind blows through) Gimme your walkie. (takes radio and broadcasts) Everybody listen up. This is Joe. I need all hands in the North Field.\nRITCHIE: (gets Joe's attention and points to the horizon) What is that?\n(seconds later, both men are engulfed by a blinding blue light)\n(a lone patron spends some time refining his game in the early morning hours while the manager tends to chores around the building)\nDONNIE: (after nearly rolling a strike, but leaving the 2 and 4 pin) Damn it!\nSAM WEISS: (consoling from a few lanes away) Some days you've got it, Donnie, some days you don't.\nDONNIE: I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee. (walks away from the foul line)\n(Sam approaches a ball return and inspects a maroon bowling ball involuntarily bouncing against the ball next to it. He walks to the equipment room, closes the door behind him, and opens a padlock on a large cabinet. Sam removes a large box, opens it, takes out a Newton's Cradle and places it on the work counter. He steps back and watches the device and waits. After a few seconds, two of the five suspended metallic balls begin to bounce off of either end of the string - automatically transferring energy like the maroon bowling ball. Sam grows concerned)\n(Olivia wakes up smiling, slips out of her boyfriends embrace, brushes her hand over Peter's head, hops out of bed and leaves the bedroom for the hallway)\nWALTER: (enters the hallway. naked, except for furry slippers) Good morning, Olivia. I didn't know you were spending the night. What a lovely surprise.\nOLIVIA: (flustered at the sight) Oh, no. The surprise is all mine.\nWALTER: I am going to pop another mushroom frittata into the oven. I got some Morels from the market with the biggest caps you've ever seen.\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nWALTER: (passing her) Olivia.\nOLIVIA: (eyes to the ceiling) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nWALTER: You should get some slippers for when you stay over here. This house can get very chilly. (laughs)\nOLIVIA: Right. Okay.\nWALTER: (singing) And some magic mushrooms and they put them in the stew.\n(Olivia scurries back to bed and clears her throat)\nPETER: (sighs as he wakes. groggily) What time is it?\nOLIVIA: It's six-thirty in the morning...\nPETER: Oh, gawd.\nOLIVIA: (contrite) ...and, uh, your father is walking around the house naked.\nPETER: Oh, yeah, it's Tuesday. (chuckles) He always cooks naked on Tuesdays.\nOLIVIA: Is that safe?\nPETER: Uh-uh. It's not pretty either. But you get used to it. (snuggles closer)\nOLIVIA: (softly) Hmm. I could get used to this. (smirks. sincere) This is my favorite time of day. The sunrise, when the world is full of promise. (phones vibrate and ring)\nPETER: (groans. disappointed at the interrupting calls) Well, that's not.\n(the Fringe team arrives, parks, exits their vehicle and are astounded by the localized devastation in the grazing pasture)\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nBROYLES: (approaches the new arrivals) A ranch foreman and a farmhand are confirmed missing, along with an entire herd of sheep. Over five hundred head gone.\nOLIVIA: How is that possible?\nBROYLES: You tell me. No hurricanes or tornadoes in the area. Barometers remained steady.\nPETER: There's an army base about twenty miles from here.\nBROYLES: I thought that too, but we ruled out weapons testing. Whatever happened here, we didn't cause it.\nWALTER: (knowing) I wouldn't bet the farm on that. (moves away to inspect the area)\nOLIVIA: When did this happen? Do we have a time on the incident?\nBROYLES: 6:05 A.M., give or take a few minutes depending on the individual report. (looks to a nearby eyewitness) That man owns the neighboring property. He was outside when it happened. I'd like you to question him.\nOLIVIA: Sure. (walks toward the eyewitness)\nWALTER: Peter! A hand! Come quickly! (scratching at a huge boulder) This granite contains quartz crystals. My electrometer.\nPETER: (hands over the boxed instrument) Quartz crystals only develop an electrical potential when they're put under physical pressure.\nWALTER: Extreme physical pressure caused by a major gravitational event. (electrometer clicks as he places electrodes on the boulder) Highly charged, of course.\nPETER: And I suppose you have a theory?\nWALTER: (nods) I believe that a vortex appeared above this field, consuming everything in its path. My worst fear is realized... our world is breaking down around us.\nPETER: Well, let's not jump to conclusions.\nWALTER: I'm not.\nPETER: Even if that is true, Walter, why now? What would trigger a vortex?\nWALTER: That's a good question.\n(walking with a sense of urgency through the interior halls of the remote hangar that houses the Wave Sink Device)\nNINA SHARP: This is clearance Double A. I want all unnecessary personnel sent home.\nSCIENCE DIRECTOR: I've issued the bulletin.\nNINA SHARP: How many on duty when it started?\nSCIENCE DIRECTOR: Four. It was a skeletal crew.\nNINA SHARP: (scolding) And we're sure it wasn't tampered with?\nSCIENCE DIRECTOR: (defensive) It wasn't. We reviewed the footage. With all due respect, there's no way.\nNINA SHARP: (on her cell phone) Get me Agent Broyles.\nBROYLES: (answers the video call from the pasture outside of Accord) Yes. Hello, Nina.\nNINA SHARP: Phillip, the machine came on. Can you hear me?\nBROYLES: I can hear you. Go on.\nNINA SHARP: The machine came on by itself, without Peter.\nBROYLES: When?\nNINA SHARP: 6:02 A.M. There was no warning. (the device starts surging)\nBROYLES: Is that noise the machine?\nNINA SHARP: (machine rumbles, Nina turns the camera phone toward the machine, then back to her) Tell Walter it's on. He needs to know. (uncharacteristically intimidated)\nPETER: What do you mean, the machine is activated?\nBROYLES: Apparently, it powered up by itself. It appears our assumptions were wrong.\nWALTER: What time did this happen?\nBROYLES: Just after six this morning.\nWALTER: Of course. That's the reason. The machine activated just after six, just minutes before the vortex opened.\nOLIVIA: So you think it caused this?\nWALTER: Yes, and if it's the end of the world... this is just the beginning.\nOLIVIA: (approaches Peter's workstation) Anything?\nPETER: (frustrated) This is worthless.\nOLIVIA: Peter.\nPETER: Up until now, we've been operating under the assumption that I was somehow the power source for this machine, but clearly that was wrong.\nOLIVIA: You're the only one that the machine's responded to. You've said so yourself.\nPETER: And yet it turned itself on while I was two hundred miles away. So how do we explain that?\nWALTER: (approaches quickly with a computer graph) I think I understand. The machine's magnetic field is warped in a patterned I've only seen one other time. The typewriter that the other Olivia used to communicate with the other side.\nOLIVIA: What are you suggesting, Walter?\nPETER: Quantum entanglement.\nWALTER: I'm afraid so.\nOLIVIA: You think that Walternate turned the machine on over there?\nWALTER: Which triggered a sympathetic response from the one over here. Yes, it makes sense.\nOLIVIA: But how? I mean, how could he do that without Peter?\nWALTER: There's not much we do know for sure.\nASTRID: (approaches) I just got off the phone with Broyles. Three more reported incidents. Massive colonies of bats were spotted above the New Jersey turnpike. Mini quakes in Florida. And in Newton, thirty acres of woodland completely decimated. All organic life just dead and desiccated in a matter of hours.\nOLIVIA: The Blight.\nWALTER: (gravely concerned) At this point, I believe that the events will begin to increase exponentially. And there's no way to stop it. He's won. (somber) Walternate has won.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh! It's chilly!\nMARY: Well, Doctor Marna said two weeks, and he's three weeks old yesterday. You worry too much. Besides, the fresh air's gonna do him some good.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Look at him, just kind of sizing up the world.\nMARY: He's alert, that one.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, it is kind of windy. So will you humor me? Here. Oh, nice and warm. (pager beeps) oh.\nMARY: Let me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: See, it's supposed to be my day off.\nMARY: Not the first time we've heard that.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. (checks page)\nMAN IN PARK: Kids, let's go!\nMARY: We'll be okay if you have to go.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (to Henry) Heh! You are such a nugget. Oh, I know. Mwah! I love you. (to Mary) Alright, I'll call you when I have some idea of what time I'm gonna be home.\nMARY: Okay. Don't worry, I'll keep him safe. You just keep the rest of us safe.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. (departs)\n(sitting in the back of the response vehicle with his team)\nLINCOLN LEE: (reading from a status monitor) The Lookers have detected a spatial discontinuity.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. How bad?\nLINCOLN LEE: Power density spikes reaching over three thousand milliwatts per square meter, and that's two hundred meters away from the focal point.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: This is a Class Nine event?\nLINCOLN LEE: No, it's a Ten. The power spikes are coming from Liberty Island. The D.O.D. complex. Charlie and the evacuation teams are en route.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, air quality normal. No need for oxygen. Let's go.\nLINCOLN LEE: (activates his earpiece as the team exits the vehicle) This is Agent Lee. We're still seeing dangerously high levels. Understood, Mister Secretary. (to the team) False alarm! Let's pack it back up!\nTEAM MEMBER: Yeah, stand down. Let's go, come on.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's going on?\nLINCOLN LEE: We've been ordered to stand down.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: But what about the energy surges?\nLINCOLN LEE: (looks across the harbor at Liberty Island) They're still happening.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, did they give you any reasons as to why?\nLINCOLN LEE: Explanations are above my pay grade.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I think I know who to ask.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Damn it. No measurable improvement?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Environmental degradation levels haven't changed since the device was activated.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Reversing this many years of damage will take longer than a few hours.\nMAJOR WARNER: (video screen call) Mister Secretary, Olivia Dunham is here to see you.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Send her in. (to Brandon) Let me know if anything changes.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (as he leaves the office) Olivia.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Olivia. (shakes hands) I'd hoped you brought Henry.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, he's with the nanny. I'm actually on duty at the moment, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (steps back) So this is a professional visit?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Fringe Division identified a Class Ten energy surge emanating from this complex, which would normally justify evacuating a ten-mile radius around the epicenter.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: There's no danger for the general public. We've taken proper precautions.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Of course. I wasn't suggesting otherwise. (pauses) When I was returning from over there, you had me steal a piece of tech. Tech that you said was part of a weapon that could destroy the other side.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What exactly are you asking, Olivia?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Have you activated that weapon? Is that what's causing the surge?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (turns a walks to the map) That's classified.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's going to happen to the people over there?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (stern) My concern is for the people of our world.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: But your son is over there.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I'm aware. (faces her. stoically) Peter chose to leave. He chose his allegiance. I chose to give up my son so that you could keep yours. (dismissive) Now, if there's nothing further...\n(standing and studying boards posted with Wave Sink Device schematics)\nASTRID: So what do we do?\nPETER: What if we just broke it back down into its component parts?\nWALTER: With the amount of energy this machine is generating, I don't know what would happen. The machine is quantum entangled. It could tear us apart with the energy from the other side alone.\nASTRID: And is that more dangerous than vortexes putting holes in our universe? Walter, our world is tearing apart at the seams.\nWALTER: Still, I'm afraid anything we might do could have devastating consequences.\nOLIVIA: (joins the group) I just spoke to Nina. I was right. They picked up an electromagnetic spike at 5:47 this morning in upstate New York.\nPETER: Fifteen minutes before the vortex opened.\nWALTER: Is that how they predict anomalies on the other side?\nOLIVIA: (nods yes) They also look for odd thermal patterns and radiation spikes. I've got Nina tracking all three.\nASTRID: An Early Warning System. Well, at least we'll be able to warn people.\nWALTER: And maybe save some lives.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna go to Massive Dynamic and help Nina with the protocol. (starts to leave)\nPETER: (catches-up to her. studies her face. concerned) Olivia.\nOLIVIA: I'll call you when I get to New York. Can you let me know if Walter comes up with anything? There's got to be a way to stop the machine. (leaves the lab)\nWALTER: (studying the schematics) Perhaps if we encased the entire machine in lead... contained the energy it's emitting.\nPETER: Walter. We both know there's another way. (in Walter's office) It makes sense, Walter. We all thought that I could turn the machine on. Maybe I can turn it off. Maybe that's what the drawing means.\nWALTER: We don't know what the drawing means. {removes a bootleg flask from the desk)\nPETER: If your theory is accurate, we're running out of time. (sits. watches as Walter pours two stiff drinks) And the way that machine responded to me after I touched it, it's like it's been calling out to me. Every piece of data we have about the machine points to one conclusion. Somehow, that machine was made for me.\nWALTER: (softly) Peter, you could die.\nPETER: And if we do nothing, we're all gonna die.\nWALTER: (slides a drink to Peter. studies his drink and remembers) Give him the keys and save the girl.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: This is what he was doing. He was preparing me.\nPETER: Who?\nWALTER: The Observer. He was preparing me because he knew I would have to let you go. That I would... that I would have to sacrifice you to fix the problems I'd created.\nPETER: (earnestly) I think this is what I'm supposed to do. But I can't do it without your help.\n(the Bishops raise their glasses and toast. Peter throws back his shot)\n(Olivia drives quickly to meet with Nina and listens to the developing news)\nRADIO NEWSCAST: Police and fire departments have been responding to unexplained weather phenomena up and down the Eastern Seaboard for the last twenty-four hours. The National Weather Service has released a storm advisory for the entire East Coast.\nNINA SHARP: (on phone, pacing her office) What do you mean, he's gone? He has to be somewhere. He didn't just disappear. There's always a trail. Keep looking. (intercom beeps) Yes?\nASSISTANT: (on the intercom) Agent Dunham has arrived.\nNINA SHARP: Oh, good. Send her in.\nOLIVIA: (enters the office) Nina.\nNINA SHARP: We're moving forward as you requested. I've assembled a team. I've briefed them on the protocol you outlined.\nOLIVIA: Okay, good. So where are we in terms of coverage?\nNINA SHARP: Well, I've tasked all of our satellites to focus on the Northeast States. (points to large monitor)\nOLIVIA: So this is where the thermal detection is up and running?\nNINA SHARP: Yes, but it's far from complete. It does give us lead time, however, if a vortex starts forming in a densely populated area.\nOLIVIA: What about the electromagnetic disturbances?\nNINA SHARP: We've recalibrated our entire cell tower network to warn us if any are detected.\nOLIVIA: And Amber?\nNINA SHARP: Alright, there we've hit a wall. We have enough Amber to contain eight, maybe ten events. But beyond that, our chemists are having a great deal of difficulty finding some of the more rare elements.\nOLIVIA: Without the Amber, early detection is irrelevant.\nNINA SHARP: (hesitant) Yes, well... it wasn't supposed to be this way.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean, it wasn't supposed to be this way?\nNINA SHARP: I was told on good authority that if you and Peter were together, it would all work out.\nOLIVIA: What are you talking about? On whose authority?\nNINA SHARP: There's a man that William knew. I'm not sure where they met. But he had great confidence in him. He trusted him implicitly. He advised me to do the same. After William went missing, when circumstances warranted, I would consult with him. This man knows a great deal about the machine.\nOLIVIA: (incensed) And you didn't think it was worth mentioning until now?\nNINA SHARP: No, he said if I divulged what he had told me that I would never see, or hear from him again. I didn't want to risk losing that connection.\nOLIVIA: Nina, our universe is breaking down. If this man has any information about the machine, then I need to know who he is and what he told you.\nNINA SHARP: You've already met him. Sam Weiss. (in a separate room she shows Olivia the copies of The First People books they have collected so far) William told me he possessed knowledge beyond anything I could fathom, but even I never suspected anything of this magnitude.\nOLIVIA: So how'd you find out?\nNINA SHARP: The authors. Anagrams. I figured it out a few weeks ago. Even the Hebrew and Russian ones are phonetic scramblings of his name.\nOLIVIA: We've been through these books hundreds of times. So what else does he know?\nNINA SHARP: I think you and I both know that Sam will reveal only what he wants to.\nOLIVIA: Not this time.\nNINA SHARP: If you track him down. We don't have an address for him. He disconnected his phone, shut down the bowling alley. Nobody has seen him since.\nOLIVIA: If there's even a chance that he can turn this machine off, then I have to speak to him. I'll find him. (leaves the office)\n(a playful young couple runs from the woods back to their pick-up truck)\nJACK: (in childish pursuit) I need the keys, Jeanie.\nJEANIE: (successfully eluding capture) Catch me.\nJACK: C'mon! Jeanie.\nJEANIE: (gleeful) Nope.\nJACK: Jeanie.\nJEANIE: No. (dives in the passenger side and slides over to the drivers' position)\nJACK: You're... (to his smiling girlfriend) I didn't mean it.\nJEANIE: Yeah? (sincere) Then what did you mean?\nJACK: (honest) I meant that you mean a lot to me. (heartfelt) You're kind of amazing.\nJEANIE: (after handing him the keys and a quick kiss) Jack.\nJACK: What?\nJEANIE: (looking out the front window at strange aberration forming in the sky) What is that?\nJACK: I have no idea.\n(nearby, Sam Weiss looks through a trans-dimensional viewing window at the growing vortex. focused and concerned, he quickly calculates a complex physics equation in the notebook he is holding)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (holding her son and singing softly) I see the moon, the moon sees me, shining through the old oak tree, please let the light that shines down on me, shine down on the one that I love(whispers) That's you. (places Henry in the crib)\nLINCOLN LEE: (holding a framed picture of the two of them together after she received a medal) Remember this?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. That was my first commendation.\nLINCOLN LEE: Yeah, for dragging my ass out of a Class Four vortex.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (laughs) well, you actually owed me fifty bucks, so I was going for your wallet.\nLINCOLN LEE: Seems like a million years ago. (sighs) You can't do this alone, Liv. Let me come with you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: As much as I would love to have you watching my butt, I need you here. Now if I'm not back tomorrow, you're gonna take Henry to my mother's, right?\nLINCOLN LEE: (adamant) You're coming back.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, but if I don't, I need to know that he's safe. You're the only one that I trust.\nLINCOLN LEE: You really think Peter Bishop can stop this? That he can heal both worlds?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't know, but if anyone can change the Secretary's mind and get him to turn that machine off, then it's his son, right?\nLINCOLN LEE: I'll see you when you get back. (big hug)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (return hug and a pat on the back) Okay. (leaves the apartment)\n(in his lab, Brandon Fayette sits and work while the local ball game plays on the radio)\nRADIO SPORTSCAST: It's a beautiful night here at Ebbets Field, bottom of the fifth. The Dodgers are leading the Expos two to nothing. And Charles is yet to give up a hit.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (startled at the late night visit) Agent Dunham. This is a restricted area.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (levels her pistol at the scientist) Ten months ago, the Secretary brought Peter Bishop back from the other side. How?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (bluffing) I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe if you just put the gun down.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (dead serious) Lie to me again and I'll shoot you in the knee. I read the mission logs. I know that the Secretary developed technology to cross between universes and bring back Peter Bishop. Show me where it is. (sternly) Now.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (while being marched down the hallway at gunpoint) The Watch Commander patrols this area every five minutes.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's every twelve, actually. Nice try.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: You realize this is never going to work, right?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I did not ask for your opinion.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: The technology you want never made it out of the test phase because it breaks down the molecular cohesion of the person crossing over. The Secretary took a huge risk using it once. In some test subjects, even that proved lethal.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (stops in front of a locked storage room) I appreciate your concern. Now open the door.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (places his hand on the access panel, opens the door and enters) This stuff is not organized.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You've got five seconds. Four...\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (after another failed bluff) Here it is. (opens case with several large clear cylinders) One will get you there and back. (condescending) If you make it to the other side, just stay there, because when the Secretary finds out you're a traitor--\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'll take my chances. (as she pistol whips him across the temple. she grabs two cylinders and dashes down the hall to find approaching sentries)\nGUARDS: Stop! (fires his rifle) There she is! (alarms sound as she takes an elevator to the access tunnels below) Put your hands up. Let's go! (fire as she flees) The other side! Suspect northeast tunnel. (trapping her behind a locked gate) Hold your position! Show us your hands, or we will fire on you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (attempts to crossover by activating one of the devices. but fails) Son of a bitch.\nLANDLORD: (answer a knock on the door of his apartment) What do you want?\nOLIVIA: (flashes her badge and ID in his face) F.B.I.\nLANDLORD: (walking toward his tenants room) Seamus Wiles, now that you mention it, never struck me as an Irish. Sam Weiss, that makes sense.\nOLIVIA: Well, he went by a few different names, but only one of them rented an apartment in Boston.\nLANDLORD: You're not gonna tell me what he did?\nOLIVIA: I just need to ask him a few questions.\nLANDLORD: So long as there's no dead bodies in there. (unlocks the door, opens it and enters)\nOLIVIA: (enters the empty living space) What? Did he move out? (searches the room for clues)\nLANDLORD: If he did, he didn't tell me. Last guy who bailed on the apartment ended up being a hoarder. Took me three weeks to clear out the trash.\n(Peter sits in front of a row of monitors. in deep contemplation, he waits for his safety jumpsuit)\nTECHNICIAN: (place the garment on the desk) Here you go, sir.\nBROYLES: (engaged in a sidebar conversation in the hallway) Do you really think this could work? That Peter can turn off the machine?\nWALTER: (growing jittery) The machine's emitting an energy signature almost like an electric current. Peter thinks that because of his relationship with the machine, that if he goes into it, the current will run through him, creating a kind of a closed circuit. And if he can complete the circuit, then he can also break it or turn it off.\nBROYLES: What do you think?\nWALTER: Excuse me?\nBROYLES: Peter's your son. As a father, do you think this is a good idea?\nWALTER: It's because of my selfishness, my inability to let my son go twenty-six years ago that this is happening. My opinion as a father, it doesn't matter.\nBROYLES: Walter, it matters to me.\nWALTER: (hesitates. at a loss) I honestly don't know what's gonna happen, Phillip. And the current of energy is so powerful. It's unlike anything I've ever seen. And the thought of what that could do to my son... I don't want him to suffer.\nTECHNICIAN: (to Peter, as he finishes suiting-up) You're all set, Mister Bishop.\nASTRID: Are you sure you don't want me to call Olivia?\nPETER: If it doesn't work, she's gonna find out soon enough. Just tell her that --\nASTRID: Whatever it is, you'll tell her yourself.\nWALTER: Can I get you anything, son? A sedative? Something to calm you?\nPETER: I'm calm.\nWALTER: You're sure now?\nPETER: I'm okay, Walter.\nBROYLES: The techs said they're ready when you are, Peter. Good luck.\nPETER: If this works and I save both universes, I want you to consider me officially retired.\nBROYLES: (humorously) I'll think about it.\nASTRID: (offers a bug hug) We'll be here waiting for you.\nWALTER: Wait. Give me your hands.\nPETER: (gets a squeeze of hand gel) What is that?\nWALTER: Electro-conductive gel. If there's an energy current, it will pass through the hand holds and this gel will keep it from burning your skin.\nPETER: Walter... I'm okay.\nWALTER: (quietly) I was never good at letting you go.\nPETER: This time, you have to.\nWALTER: (swell of pride) Son...\nPETER: I know. (walks to device and rides the access platform to the top. slowly he places an open palm on the side of the machine and receives a violent shock that blasts him off of the platform and twenty feet to the ground below)\nWALTER: Peter! (as his son rolls to a stop. unconscious. his head and face covered in blood)\n(the gurney with Peter's damaged body is rushed into the emergency treatment ward)\nEMT #1: Male, thirty-two years of age, closed head trauma, possible concussion, non-responsive.\nWALTER: He suffered a massive surge of electricity.\nER DOCTOR: Vitals?\nEMT #2: BP 80 over 50. Pulse 45, regular.\nER DOCTOR: Gail, what's open?\nNURSE GAIL: Trauma Bay Two.\nWALTER: His blood type is A-positive.\nER DOCTOR: Let's take him to Two. We'll do an MRI.\nWALTER: And you need to do an echocardiogram as well.\nER DOCTOR: You have to wait here, sir.\nWALTER: No, no, no, no, no. You listen. No, no. You listen to me. (quavering) This is my son.\nER DOCTOR: I understand, sir. We'll take good care of him.\n(Astrid catches-up to Walter to help him with the waiting)\nNURSE GAIL: (later. to Olivia as she bursts into and past the ER reception area) Excuse me, Miss. This area's for staff and immediate family only.\nOLIVIA: (flashes badge) I'm looking for Peter Bishop. He was brought in about an hour ago. He's a white, thirty-two --\nASTRID: Olivia! (intercepting the nurse) She's with us.\nOLIVIA: How's Peter?\nASTRID: He's still unconscious, but his vitals are stable. They just -- they can't wake him up. He's with the doctors now.\nOLIVIA: Oh, god.\nASTRID: They did an MRI. They said that there is no apparent brain trauma. They're just hoping that he's gonna come out of it soon.\nOLIVIA: What happened?\nASTRID: (sighs) Peter tried to go into the machine. It wouldn't let him. It's like it's... protecting itself or something.\nOLIVIA: Is Walter here?\nASTRID: Yeah. He's taking it pretty hard.\nWALTER: (enters. looks around) I don't know my way around here. Other people, I suppose, find comfort being in chapels, speaking to you. (begins to negotiate) I have no other place to turn. I asked you for a sign, and you sent it to me. A white tulip. And I was so grateful. Since then, in moments of deep despair, I have found solace in believing that you had forgiven me. I was willing to let him go. I was willing to let Peter die. I've changed. That should matter. (makes his proposal) God, I know my crimes are unforgiveable. So punish me. Do what you want to me. But I beg you, spare our world. (kneels and weeps)\n(Olivia sits in the waiting area quietly thinking about Peter. the dappled light on the carpet in front of her begins to move and flicker. she steps outside and sees the light in the sky above the horizon is changing. the man she has been looking for comes bounding up the stairs to the entrance of the building)\nSAM WEISS: Hello, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Sam, I've been looking for you everywhere. The machine is on.\nSAM WEISS: I know. And I need you to take me to it.\nOLIVIA: Sam, what is going on?\nSAM WEISS: Olivia, you have to trust me now, please. We don't have a lot of time. (walks off)\n(the senior politician walks down a darkened corridor in the military complex he runs and turns on the light in cell holding one of his previously most trusted agents)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I know this is hard for you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (sitting smugly) Oh, you don't know anything about me.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Don't I? This morning in my office, you asked how I could be willing to let my son die to heal our world. But you understand sacrifice better than anyone, Olivia. You were willing to leave your son behind, to risk your life for what you perceived to be the greater good. We're more alike than you think.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't understand how killing billions of people could possibly be in the interest of the greater good.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: That's because you still have the luxury of your ideals. I have to be pragmatic. You've put me in a difficult position. Anyone else would be rotting away in a stockade for treason, but you are the mother of my grandson. You'll stay here for your own good until this is over. (turns the lights out and walks away)"

I was just resting my eyes.\nASTRID: How is he?\nWALTER: His pulse is strong.\nASTRID: I just spoke with Doctor Levin. She\u2019s planning on keeping him sedated for at least another twelve hours. She thinks the fact that his vitals are stable is a very positive sign. She\u2019s hopeful that he\u2019s gonna come out of this without any permanent damage.\nWALTER: She can\u2019t possibly know that. Peter interacted with a machine of immense power. A surge like that could have disrupted his neural patterns, created memory deficits... Aphasia.\nASTRID: Walter, let\u2019s wait and see, okay? (upbeat) How about we go for a walk? You know, you haven\u2019t eaten in hours. The cafeteria is just downstairs. I think I saw tapioca pudding on the menu.\nWALTER: (reluctant to step out) Well, I can\u2019t deny I\u2019m hungry.\n(a family drives in moderate traffic through Massachusetts farm country. the teenage son sits in the backseat, listens to music on his headset, watches the odd weather, then notices as the hair on his forearm stands straight-up)\nNATE: Hey Dad, something weird is happening.\nGARY: What\u2019s up, Nate?\nKARA: Are you feeling sick?\nNATE: No, I -- (a bolt of lightning hits the SUV in front of them and it flips onto it's roof and slides)\nGARY: (after stopping) What the hell was that? (electrical bolts strike around the vehicle)\nKARA: Ah! (her husband backs the vehicle away where they initially stopped. turns to her son) Are you okay, Nate?\nNATE: I think so.\nGARY: It\u2019s okay, buddy. It\u2019s over. You wait here. I\u2019m gonna take a look. (prepares to walk forward toward the accident scene)\nKARA: (concerned) Gary, no.\nGARY: You\u2019ll be safe in the car. Just stay down, don\u2019t touch anything. (jogs up the hillside to the overpass. finds a damaged vehicle. looks out over the score of vehicles stopped on the roadway. electrical bolts repeatedly strike the roadway and nearby fields)\nSAM WEISS: (standing in the hangar bay studying the large weapon) It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this way.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean - 'this way'?\nSAM WEISS: It\u2019s already on.\nOLIVIA: Yes, it\u2019s been on for the past thirty-two hours.\nSAM WEISS: But how can that be? This doesn\u2019t make sense.\nOLIVIA: Walter thinks that the machines are quantum entangled and that this machine was triggered when they activated theirs on the other side.\nSAM WEISS: Even so, how did they turn it on in the first place? This machine was built for Peter. Only he can operate it.\nOLIVIA: Well, he tried, but the machine sent him flying.\nSAM WEISS: (throws pen at it and watches as it deflects and buries in nearby piece of equipment) It\u2019s hot-wired. It\u2019s tricked into thinking he\u2019s already inside. That\u2019s why it\u2019s repelling anyone or anything trying to enter.\nOLIVIA: So you\u2019re thinking that it\u2019s malfunctioning.\nSAM WEISS: What I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s frustrated... in a manner of speaking. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing all this damage out in the world. It\u2019s not a Doomsday Device, but it\u2019s acting like one.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so how do we stop it?\nSAM WEISS: In case of emergency, break glass. (unrolls an ancient scroll) I believe there\u2019s a way we can disarm the force field and let Peter in safely.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I read the First People book cover to cover and there\u2019s nothing in it about that.\nSAM WEISS: Not in your book. This is the manuscript the books are based on. These pages were never published.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so what am I looking at?\nSAM WEISS: This is a box. (leafs through the document) This is the key that opens the box.\nOLIVIA: Well, what\u2019s inside the box?\nSAM WEISS: According to this, it\u2019s a crowbar of sorts.\nOLIVIA: A crowbar?\nSAM WEISS: Yes. It\u2019ll pry the force field open long enough for Peter to get in.\nOLIVIA: And what happens if he does? Does he die?\nSAM WEISS: No. I don\u2019t think so.\nOLIVIA: You don\u2019t think so?\nSAM WEISS: As I understand it, the machine is indestructible. So if Peter gets in, he should be safe.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so where are these now?\nSAM WEISS: Come on.\nWALTER: (walking the corridor with a cafeteria tray loaded with food) It\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve seen a classic fruit cocktail. Why do you suppose that is?\nASTRID: I suppose loading fruit with sugar, artificial flavors and dyes has just fallen out of favor.\nWALTER: That\u2019s a shame, isn\u2019t it?\nDOCTOR: (on the move behind them. to an assistant) Not a fire. It\u2019s a freak lightning storm. I need you to call the Burn Center, see how many they can take.\nNURSE: (later, as victims roll in) Second-degree burns. Trauma Bay Four is prepped and ready.\nWALTER: (to Astrid as they watch the ranks swell) Getting worse.\nASTRID: We don\u2019t know that this has anything to do with the machine.\nWALTER: I think we do.\nBROYLES: (approaching the duo) I want another team on the scene and get the Governor on the line.\nASTRID: Hey, what happened?\nBROYLES: A spontaneous dry lightning storm just outside Worcester. Twenty-five people injured in similar storms are being reported up and down the Eastern Seaboard.\nWALTER: Electro-static fluctuations in the atmosphere. I\u2019m not surprised.\nBROYLES: (phone rings) Sorry, I have to take this. (to caller) Yes? put him through. Mister Governor.\nWALTER: (starts back to Peter's room) We should get back to Peter.\nASTRID: Walter, this is a Fringe Event. We need to get back to the lab.\nWALTER: I\u2019m not leaving him.\nASTRID: Peter would not want you to sit by his bedside and do nothing. I\u2019ll make sure that the hospital calls us. We\u2019ll be back before he wakes up.\nWALTER: (firmly) I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m out of ideas. Forgive me if I\u2019d like to spend my remaining time with my son.\nASTRID: Well, what about Olivia? You saw how hard it was for her to leave him, but she\u2019s out there trying to find a way to end this.\nWALTER: I too have tried. I went so far as to ask God for help. And how did he respond? Nothing.\nASTRID: That\u2019s your excuse? Come on now. What have you done, Walter? God helps those who help themselves.\nWALTER: Poor Richard\u2019s Almanac.\nASTRID: What?\nWALTER: (inspired) Ben Franklin. That was his phrase. 'God helps those who help themselves'. You\u2019re right. We have to investigate. We can\u2019t begin to neutralize this until we understand.\nASTRID: Well, where are we going?\nWALTER: To get my kite. (starts to leave)\nSAM WEISS: See the thing is I\u2019m not the first Sam Weiss.\nOLIVIA: (refers to the large stone sarcophagus they have gathered around) So which Sam Weiss is this?\nSAM WEISS: That\u2019s my great-great-great-great grandfather. He was digging for Mastodon bones when he discovered an ancient manuscript instead.\nOLIVIA: So he was the one who wrote the First People book.\nSAM WEISS: No, that was the fifth Sam Weiss. The third and fourth Sams spent their lives searching for the manuscript\u2019s missing sections.\nOLIVIA: You\u2019re a dedicated bunch.\nSAM WEISS: A machine with the power to create and destroy worlds shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. (prying the lid off of the tomb) Dang, this is heavy. (removes a metal container the size of shoebox)\nOLIVIA: Okay. Let\u2019s go get the key.\nSAM WEISS: No. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be doing this at all. The crowbar\u2019s not to be used unless something goes wrong with the machine.\nOLIVIA: Uh, look outside, Sam. Something is going wrong.\nSAM WEISS: The timeline\u2019s not right. Maybe this is a cosmic hiccup. Maybe it\u2019ll course-correct on its own.\nOLIVIA: Or maybe it will destroy two universes.\nSAM WEISS: That\u2019s exactly my point. You know, generations of knowledge have been bestowed upon me. But no one said anything about the other side turning on the machine first.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Sam, I\u2019m gonna make this really easy for you. I am armed and I want you to take me to the key now.\n(in the grassy quad on campus, Walter wrangles a kite with sensors through the strong winds)\nWALTER: Ho-ho! That\u2019s it! Come and get me! Strike me down, you sprites, you elves, you glorious blue jets!\nASTRID: (monitoring the gauges covering a nearby work table) Walter, this can\u2019t possibly be safe.\nWALTER: Nonsense! I\u2019m fully insulated. Are you tracking the field strength?\nASTRID: Yeah, it\u2019s all over the place. Needle won\u2019t sit still.\nWALTER: (as an electrical charge finds its' way to his hands) Ah-ha! Oh! Whoo! Whoo! What was the voltage on that one?\nASTRID: Uh... (as the equipment starts to smoke slightly) I\u2019m gonna go with 'high'. We\u2019re not even getting any more electrical readings.\nWALTER: What about barometric pressure?\nASTRID: (as another bolt dumps him on his backside) Walter! Oh, my God! Hey! Hey, Walter.\nWALTER: (revives) What happened?\nASTRID: You just got struck by lightning twice.\nWALTER: That\u2019s it. The missing variable. (elated) Oh, Ostrich, you are a genius!\nASTRID: (tentative. genuinely baffled) Why?\nWALTER: Repetition, my Dear. We have to account for repetition. Pack all this up. We\u2019re going back to the lab.\nASTRID: Okay.\nWALTER: Haa haa. (points to the kite and the sky)\n(a life sign monitor beeps steadily. Peter's eyes open wide. he removes the electrodes and sensors attached to him as he sits-up. he checks the wardrobe, finds his personal effects, dresses and wanders into the hall, seemingly disoriented)\nNURSE: (answers ringing phone) ICU. We\u2019ve got two, maybe three free beds. You\u2019re gonna have to send some of them to General. (fails to detect Peter behind her)\nER STAFF: (as chaos ensues) Please, you need to lie down, ma\u2019am. If your daughter is here \u2014 Help! He\u2019s not breathing! Get me the cardiologist on call.\nNURSE #2: (challenges the disoriented Peter Bishop) Excuse me. Sir, you alright? What\u2019s your name?\nPETER: My name\u2019s...\nNURSE #2: (notices his wristband) Are you a patient?\nDOCTOR #2: (summons the nurse) I need a crash cart in here.\nNURSE #2: (task saturated) Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\n(Peter finds his way to an exit and leaves the hospital)\nPETER: (after walking the busy streets. he hails a) Taxi!\nCABBIE: (after his fare hops in) Where you headed, pal?\nPETER: 42nd and Lex, please.\nCABBIE: Come again?\nPETER: 42nd and Lex, Midtown.\nCABBIE: (eyeballs the man in the backseat) Are you feeling okay?\nPETER: Yeah, I\u2019m fine. Why?\nCABBIE: 42nd and Lexington is in New York, and we are in Pittsfield. That\u2019s a pretty steep fare. (Peter thinks. remembers he has a wallet. removes a credit card and lets the driver verify it) 42nd and Lex it is.\nSAM WEISS: (as he stops and parks among the emergency vehicles) Appears we\u2019ve got another problem. The key is in there, the Whitley Museum.\nPOLICE SARGEANT: (briefing the duo as he escorts them to the front of the museum) Mayor\u2019s Office has us setting up safety zones at locations of all the lightning storms.\nOLIVIA: So what\u2019s the radius?\nPOLICE SARGEANT: Oh, this one\u2019s six blocks. We\u2019ve had bigger. Quincy, Somerville, two at Southie. I barely have enough manpower to keep up. Oh, that\u2019s her. Museum Director.\nCHRISTINE ALBRIGHT: (on the phone) I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the bloody Apocalypse. I\u2019m not leaving my museum unattended. You remember what happened in Baghdad. Listen, I\u2019ll call you back later.\nPOLICE SARGEANT: Uh, ma\u2019am, this is the Agent I spoke to you about.\nOLIVIA: (holds out official identication) Olivia Dunham, FBI.\nCHRISTINE ALBRIGHT: Doctor Christine Albright.\nSAM WEISS: (holds out unofficial identication) Sam Weiss. Patron member since \u201882.\nOLIVIA: Thank you so much for meeting us. Are those the floor plans?\nCHRISTINE ALBRIGHT: (nods) mm-hmm.\nSAM WEISS: (points to specific section of the floor plan) There. That\u2019s where the key is.\nOLIVIA: You sure?\nSAM WEISS: Positive.\nCHRISTINE ALBRIGHT: That\u2019s the Native American Wing. I curated those exhibits myself. There\u2019s no key in there.\nSAM WEISS: I beg to differ.\nOLIVIA: Okay, what\u2019s the most direct route to that wing?\nCHRISTINE ALBRIGHT: You mean you want to go in? You can\u2019t. It\u2019s not safe.\nPOLICE SARGEANT: Battalion Commander said he\u2019d never seen anything like it. Lightning coming out of thin air.\nSAM WEISS: Inside the museum?\nPOLICE SARGEANT: Inside all the buildings on the block.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, that\u2019s a chance we\u2019re gonna have to take.\nCHRISTINE ALBRIGHT: Uh, go through the front entrance. That\u2019s the quickest route. Please be considerate. We\u2019ve lost enough priceless artwork for one day.\nOLIVIA: You have our word.\nASTRID: (approaches with a stack of papers) Here\u2019s everything, including the latest raw data from Massive Dynamic.\nWALTER: Excellent. Let\u2019s mark all the spots where lightning has struck more than once.\nASTRID: Because lightning shouldn\u2019t strike twice?\nWALTER: No, that\u2019s a myth. as we know, lightning can and does strike twice, given the right conditions. but the frequency of multiple strikes, that we measure.\nASTRID: You think this is gonna give us the pattern?\nWALTER: No, not by itself. But when we compare it to the frequency of seismic events and multiple radiation and thermal spikes... maybe.\nASTRID: Okay. (starts plotting on clear overlays)\nWALTER: (assembles the overlays once the data has been plotted) Seismic... and radiation... and thermal. What do you see, Dear?\nASTRID: These X\u2019s line up perfectly.\nWALTER: And what else?\nASTRID: Fringe Events seem to be clustered around two points.\nWALTER: (points to the separate regions) The foci. And a rift seems to be forming on the axis between them, like they\u2019re tugging at each other.\nASTRID: Walter, this is the exact location where our machine is housed. But why Liberty Island?\nWALTER: (suddenly realizing) Walternate.\nBROYLES: (on the phone) Do you understand what you\u2019re suggesting? We\u2019re talking mass panic. Do you have a contingency plan in place for that? (as Walter sets-up shop on his desk) Hold on. I\u2019ll call you back.\nWALTER: Here we go. A simple visual demonstration. It\u2019s important that you pay attention. (gently taps a clear table, magnets and iron filings) These two magnets... create a magnetic field between them. As a result, these iron filings line up in a pattern consistent with that field.\nBROYLES: Your point?\nWALTER: The two machines, they\u2019re acting just like the magnets. Only in this case, across universes. The pull between them creating this swath of events. At one end, the hangar where we keep our machine. The other end - Liberty Island.\nBROYLES: The location of the Department of Defense Headquarters on the other side.\nWALTER: Which is where Walternate must have built his machine - there\u2019s no other explanation. But if... (aligns the magnets) we move our machine to the same spot as theirs... we stall the pace of destruction.\nBROYLES: You want to move our machine one hundred miles and over water and park it offshore from the most densely populated city in the country?\nWALTER: (frankly) Yes. Astrid\u2019s already working out the logistics of stable transport.\nBROYLES: But when the two machines are brought together, won\u2019t that increase the intensity of events in that spot?\nWALTER: Yes, but it will buy us time. Olivia\u2019s looking for a way to get Peter inside the machine. We just have to contain the damage until she succeeds and pray that Peter is ready. (soft persuasion) Phillip... I know it sounds crazy... but it\u2019s our only viable option.\nSAM WEISS: (approaching a clear display case) There it is.\nOLIVIA: The key? I don\u2019t see it.\nSAM WEISS: That\u2019s the beauty. No one can. (retrieves nearby 'war axe')\nOLIVIA: (soft static crackles in the air) Sam? Do you hear that?\nSAM WEISS: Is it the lights?\nOLIVIA: It\u2019s not the lights. (loudly) Get down! (tackles him to the floor as electrical bolts shatter the display cases) Okay, you get the key. I\u2019ll disable the alarm. (Sam grabs the stone tablet he needs. Olivia runs to the fuse panel as security fencing drops in the hallway) It\u2019s not working. It was short circuited by the lightning. We won\u2019t make it. (Sam grabs a large round piece of debris down the hall and knocks over a large curvy urn that rolls under the descending security fence and braces it open)\nOLIVIA: (in awe) Oh, my god, Sam.\nSAM WEISS: (matter-of-factly) I work in a bowling alley.\nOLIVIA: Okay, come on. (racing from the building to safety)\n(outside. working from the back of their vehicle)\nOLIVIA: That\u2019s the key? (as he cracks the tablet enough to remove a small metallic object encased inside)\nSAM WEISS: Incredible.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so what do I do?\nSAM WEISS: I don\u2019t know. I told you, the instructions are incomplete.\nOLIVIA: I mean, there\u2019s nowhere for it to go. Are you sure that this is the right key?\nSAM WEISS: Yeah, are you kidding? My father took me to the Museum hundreds of times. Believe me, you have no idea how boring those \u2013 (the small key latches magnetically to the side of box they retrieved from the crypt) You did it.\nOLIVIA: Sam? (the box hums, then unrolls to a flat position, exposing another scroll inside) That\u2019s the crowbar? I mean, what is it?\nSAM WEISS: (opens the scroll and studies the image on it) It\u2019s you.\nOLIVIA: What does the drawing mean, Walter, and why am I in it?\nWALTER: (studies the scroll Sam recovered with a magnifying lens) Well, if it\u2019s a companion to the original picture, it means that you and Peter both have a connection to the machine.\nOLIVIA: But why? I mean, why am I connected to it?\nWALTER: Perhaps your friend here could enlighten us. (turns to Sam)\nSAM WEISS: (adamant) No. I mean, all I know is the original manuscript is very clear on this point. The lockbox contains the crowbar.\nWALTER: Then the answer is unavoidable. (to Olivia) Apparently, you have the ability to turn off the force field that\u2019s keeping Peter out and open the machine for long enough for him to get inside.\nOLIVIA: How am I supposed to do that?\nWALTER: Well, the answer lies in the drawing. Otherwise, why draw it? Oh, let\u2019s see. (turns the scroll sideways) Uh-huh. Brain waves, it would seem. (rolls it backwards to form a cylinder)\nSAM WEISS: Hey... careful with that.\nWALTER: Uh-huh. There\u2019s your answer. (points to the joined edges with Olivia's expanded image) Huh? You, Olivia, have the power to bend things with your mind. That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing in this drawing, if you look at it the right way.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you\u2019re not seriously talking about --\nSAM WEISS: Telekinesis.\nOLIVIA: No. I can\u2019t.\nWALTER: Yes, you can. You\u2019ve done it before. Two years ago, David Robert Jones. She defused a bomb by turning off some light with her mind.\nOLIVIA: Walter, that was different.\nWALTER: Well, it was less advanced. Oh, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s something else. Since it\u2019s the machine on the other side that\u2019s turned on, that\u2019s the machine you\u2019ll have to interact with.\nOLIVIA: You\u2019re not suggesting that I need to cross over.\nWALTER: No. The same part of your mind that allows you to cross over contains your ability of telekinesis. They should be able to work together in combination.\nSAM WEISS: Control the machine over there from over here.\nWALTER: In theory, yes.\nOLIVIA: (unconvinced) No, it\u2019s ridiculous, and even if it was possible, manipulating a light is nothing compared to manipulating the machine.\nWALTER: You\u2019re right. of course. Requires a much greater degree of control. (thinking ahead) We\u2019ll have to practice. Start on something smaller.\nSAM WEISS: How do we do that?\nWALTER: Ahh. (after moving to an inner office and loading a sheet of paper into the captured Selectric 251) This is the typewriter the other Olivia used to communicate with the other side. Like the two machines, it is quantum entangled with its counterpart. In this case, whatever\u2019s typed on one appears on the other, which makes it the perfect means for testing your abilities. You ready to give it a try?\nOLIVIA: So how?\nWALTER: Okay, clear your mind. Look into the mirror. Imagine that you\u2019re looking at the typewriter on the other side. Now, press those keys using your mind.\nOLIVIA: Walter, this is--\nWALTER: Shh. Don\u2019t expect it to happen so quickly. It\u2019s like meditating. You need to focus on something specific. A word, phrase... and be patient.\n(in Peter's hospital room, a staff member finds an envelope on his empty bed and becomes alarmed an places a call. the envelope has the written message - 'I am going home'.\nOLIVIA: (after he rejoins her and sits down) Walter, maybe if you gave me some Cortexiphan.\nWALTER: I\u2019m afraid at this point, it would do you more harm than good. These abilities are inside you, Olivia. You simply need to harness them.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I don\u2019t know how. I never have.\nWALTER: I know what it\u2019s like to feel unequal to the task required of you. To feel incapable. I\u2019ll never be the man I was, but I\u2019ve come to embrace those parts of my mind that are... peculiar and broken. I understand now that\u2019s what makes my mind special. (studies her for a moment) I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. You have no idea how extraordinary you are. If you would embrace that, there\u2019s no end to what you can do.\nOLIVIA: I know that you want to believe in me... and I want to believe in me... but believing doesn\u2019t make it true.\nWALTER: Just try. (she concentrates again and fails) It\u2019s okay. Take a break and we\u2019ll try again. Hmm?\nASTRID: (walks into the office) The hospital just called. Peter\u2019s missing.\nPETER: (stops a woman) Excuse me. Do you -- (stops a man) Excuse me. Hmm? Do you know if there's a pawn shop around here? I've been here before, but--\nPEDESTRIAN: No, sorry, man. I'm -- I don't know. (continues to walk)\nPETER: (turns around and stops the man again) Man, I'm sorry to disturb you, but it's just it's really important. I could have sworn there was one.\nPEDESTRIAN: (sighs) I don't know. Uh, I think there's one over on 3rd avenue.\nPETER: On 3rd? Yeah. Thank you.\n(store door bells chime. Peter looks around the shop. store owner stops his work to entertain his customer)\nPETER: (points at a display) Can I see these?\nSTORE OWNER: Sure. You a collector?\nPETER: I was... when I was a kid.\nSTORE ONWER: (lays his tray of coins in front of his customer) They're all graded and authenticated. Price-wise, everything in here, five hundred and up.\nPETER: This one. (points and picks up a coin)\nSTORE OWNER: Silver half dollar.\nPETER: It's my favorite. It always brings me luck.\nASTRID: (drops the phone) Walter, they searched the house. There's no sign of him.\nWALTER: What if he can't remember our address?\nASTRID: No, Walter, let's not assume the worst.\nWALTER: (frustrated) Is that what you think I'm doing? Because it is a fact that Peter sustained a massive blow to the head. It is a fact that he was in a hospital less than ten hours ago. It is a fact that we haven't got the slightest clue how that machine affected him. So please do not accuse me of making assumptions. (realizes he has frustratively assaulted his colleague) I'm sorry, Astrid.\nASTRID: I know you're scared, Walter.\nOLIVIA: Hey. Peter's credit card has been used twice in the past two hours. Eight hundred dollars to the Western Massachusetts Cab Company and six hundred dollars to a pawn shop in Manhattan.\nASTRID: He took a cab to New York?\nOLIVIA: It appears so. Until we speak to the driver, we won't know for sure.\nWALTER: What would he be looking for in New York?\nGUARD: Excuse me, you can't be here. we're evacuating the area.\nPETER: I know, I know, but I have to talk to my father. I have something to show him. it's really important.\nGUARD: And who, out of curiosity, is your father?\nPETER: Walter Bishop. The Secretary of Defense.\nOLIVIA: Here. (hands over a drink)\nSAM WEISS: Thank you. Any word from Peter?\nOLIVIA: No. What you doing?\nSAM WEISS: Reading. That's a lie. Trying to read. Pathetic attempt to distract myself with ancient gossip. Better than thinking about what I've done.\nOLIVIA: Sam, you didn't do anything.\nSAM WEISS: I intervened.\nOLIVIA: I didn't give you an option not to.\nBROYLES: We just got word Peter's been found.\nOLIVIA: Is he alright?\nBROYLES: He's alert, answering questions. Transport's waiting for us at the heliport.\nOLIVIA: Well, where is he?\nBROYLES: Liberty Island. The machine has arrived there as well.\nWALTER: I'll get my coat, and some Dramamine.\nBROYLES: I'm afraid this is where you get off. Official personnel only.\nOLIVIA: Sam, whatever's happening, it's not over.\nSAM WEISS: Good luck, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\n(the bowling alley manager looks out on the cityscape while the Newton's Cradle spontaneously moves)\nWALTER: Peter! What on Earth made you come here? (as Olivia gives him a hug) Are you alright, Son?\nPETER: There are two of you, aren't there? I think I've been confused.\nWALTER: (shines a light on his son's eyes and checks his blood pressure) What year is it?\nPETER: Twenty-eleven.\nWALTER: President?\nPETER: Obama.\nWALTER: Nausea, headaches, ear-ringing?\nPETER: No, physically, I feel fine.\nWALTER: And who is that woman over there?\nPETER: Olivia.\nWALTER: What's the last thing you remembered before you woke up in the hospital?\nPETER: I remember getting into the machine... or trying to.\nWALTER: Good. And do you know me?\nPETER: I know you're not the Secretary of Defense. The sweater's a dead giveaway.\nWALTER: Good. Fact that your memory's returning is a sign that your confusion is temporary. You're gonna be okay, Peter. Where'd you get this?\nOLIVIA: Walter?\nWALTER: The machine.\nBROYLES: I thought you had a plan to contain the rise in pressure.\nWALTER: The system wasn't designed for sudden fluctuations.\nBROYLES: So what can we do to compensate for that?\nWALTER: I'm afraid so long as the machine is on -- there's nothing we can do.\nOLIVIA: Oh, Peter, I was worried about you.\nPETER: I'm okay. Let's just figure this out. So the drawing implies that you need to use telekinesis? Is Walter sure?\nOLIVIA: Well, Walter's educated guess is as good as we have. Well, I mean, I tried. I concentrated on a phrase like Walter asked me to do and still nothing.\nPETER: Well, what was the phrase?\n(Astrid, disturbed by keys clacking, goes into an inner office and finds the quantum typewriter is active)\nOLIVIA: What do you mean it's working?\nASTRID: I heard the keys tapping away. It keeps typing the same message. Are you doing that?\nOLIVIA: What's the message?\nASTRID: Be a better man than your father.\nBROYLES: There\u2019s a boat leaving for Manhattan in five minutes! I want all non-essential personnel on it! That means get out now!\nWALTER: Don\u2019t worry. Just think of it as a giant typewriter.\nBROYLES: Do you know what to do?\nOLIVIA: I think so.\nBROYLES: The tremors are getting stronger.\nWALTER: Exponential microquakes. We\u2019re building towards a massive event. I suspect we don\u2019t have much time left.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what if I can\u2019t do it? What if I can\u2019t turn it off?\nWALTER: I have known you for a long time, Olivia, and I believe that the drawing was no accident. Whoever did it knew the same as I do. That you don\u2019t fail.\nPETER: You ready?\nOLIVIA: No. You?\nPETER: No. Don\u2019t say I never took you anywhere. You can do this.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (from his laboratory in the alternate universe as his monitors fluctuate wildly) Notify the Secretary. There\u2019s something happening to the machine.\nPETER: You did it.\nOLIVIA: Peter. I love you.\nPETER: Wish me luck.\nWALTER: Oh, dear God.\nLOUDSPEAKER: All civilians proceed to evacuation route immediately.\nFRINGE AGENT: Agent Bishop. Agent Bishop, take cover!\nPETER: Fringe Division? Where the hell am I?\nFRINGE AGENT: Sir, you\u2019ve been hit. Medic! I need a medic now!"

Forty-seven years old. Shrapnel wound in the abdomen.\nER NURSE: BP is 110 over 70.\nER DOCTOR: Start an IV.\nPETER: Where am I?\nASTRID: Peter, you were injured in a Fringe event. You're in good hands. It's okay, I'm right here.\nER DOCTOR: (to Peter) Lie back. Just relax. (to staff) He's bleeding pretty bad here. Get me some units of his reserve blood. Start transfusion now. (to Peter) Agent Bishop, please just lie still. (to staff) Get me the U.V. cauterizer.\nASTRID: It's alright, Peter. You're going to be fine.\n(hours later, at the reception desk)\nELLA: I'd like to find out how Peter Bishop is doing.\nER RECEPTION: May I see your badge?\nELLA: I don't have a badge... yet. I was just promoted last week. I have a temporary barcode. Can I show you that?\nER RECEPTION: Sure. (scans Ella's coded wrist and reads the results from the scanner) Thank you, Agent Dunham. Agent Bishop has been in recovery for an hour now. He should be out soon.\nOLIVIA: (approaching the reception area) Ella.\nELLA: Peter's fine, Aunt Liv. He's in recovery. (mild embarassment) I mean, uh, Agent Dunham, ma'am.\nOLIVIA: You can just call me Boss like everybody else. Now, how are you?\nELLA: I'm fine. I remember being in my SUV. And the next thing I knew, I was on the ground and there was Vortex Shrapnel everywhere. People are saying that it's the End-of-Dayers.\nOLIVIA: That's what we think, yeah. We think it's Moreau.\nPETER: (walking out the recovery area for reception) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Peter. How are you feeling?\nPETER: (with some pain) Ah... just like new.\nOLIVIA: So what'd the doctor say?\nPETER: Doctor says I'm fine.\nASTRID: No. They said to stay off his feet for a few days.\nOLIVIA: See? You're pushing yourself.\nPETER: Moreau's out there.\nOLIVIA: Peter, you got to stay off your feet. This is gonna be one of those times when you say, \"you were right.\"\nPETER: I'm not going to say that you were right because I've got state-of-the-art science on my side. (cheerful. cups her check) I feel fine, Hon.\nELLA: Do you remember what you were saying in the field about the machine and being from the past?\nPETER: (to Ella) Well, I didn't say I didn't get my bell rung, but I'm doing better now. (to Olivia) Two eggs over-easy, bacon, and grapefruit juice. That's what I made you for breakfast on Sunday.\nASTRID: Hey, guys. Look. (everyone turns to the large television monitor in the waiting area. response forces dash through the smoke and chaos on the streets of Lower Manhattan)\nOLIVIA: (shares what she already knew) There's a Stage Three tear. We've initiated Amber Protocol. (the image of the terrorist claiming responsibilty for Fringe event appears on the screen)\n(Moreau and two of his accomplices enter the empty foyer of the large theater while an operatic performance is underway and the doors closed to latecomers. Moreau puts the briefcase down that he carried in with him and moves to the door to listen to the enthralling music. Oscar removes one of the explosive devices from inside the briefcase and prepares to deploy it. A tuxedoed gentleman walks through the area after both devices have been activated and placed on the ground. he nearly walks over one of them, turns to look around and is shot twice in the chest by the third terrorist with a silenced pistol)\nMOREAU: (softly to his men to leave) Okay.\n(they hurry from the theater and at least one of the devices destroys the main interior walls of the building - and the patrons enjoying the performance)\nASTRID: Hey. The security firm just emailed this video. We think they gained entrance from the side fire door.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so how come they didn't trigger the alarm?\nASTRID: It was disabled. But that's not all. We think we found an Electrilight. It must have been a dud.\nPETER: I believe so. We finally get to see one.\nASTRID: The End of Days. Ha. That's one of my father's favorite sermons. When the world dies and a savior arrives to end the suffering and usher all the worthy into Heaven.\nPETER: Pass me those alligator clips?\nASTRID: Of course, if my father ever met one of the kooks who's actually attempting to end the world, he'd probably kill them himself.\nAGENT: (hands Astrid a stack of papers) Agent. Eyewitness statements.\nASTRID: (to Peter) I'll let you know if any of this is worthwhile.\nOLIVIA: Anything?\nPETER: No. Not only can I not tell you how the thing works, according to all the readings, it shouldn't be working at all. You know, there's probably only one person on Earth who can tell us how this thing functions.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nPETER: Got any markers you can call in?\nOLIVIA: You think now's the time?\nPETER: I think it might be past time.\n(Peter leaves the office and heads to a high security prison. inside he is escorted to a secure conversation area then sits behind a glass panel and waits while the convict he needs to talk to is summoned. Walter walks through the barred gate on the other side of the barrier. he is barely recognizable in his orange jumpsuit, long hair, bushy beard and shackles)\nPETER: Hello, Walter.\nWALTER: Must be bad if they're letting you see me.\nPETER: It is.\nWALTER: I heard a rumor that the Sun was burning out. They don't tell me much in here.\nPETER: The Sun is still shining.\nWALTER: I also hear there's been a massive increase in Kappa radiation.\nPETER: That one's true. A wormhole opened in Central Park, right in the center of Sheep's Meadow. Took us months but... we were finally able to Amber it over.\nWALTER: A wormhole shouldn't emit that type of radiation. Not unless it's a wormhole through time.\nPETER: Exactly right. The carbon levels were consistent with the late Paleozoic era. Two hundred and fifty million years ago.\nWALTER: Paleozoic. Theropods! My old self would have been fascinated with that. How's Olivia?\nPETER: She's fine. Thank you. I need your help.\nWALTER: What is it?\nPETER: We're not exactly sure. Some kind of light bomb. It's made by a terrorist group. They call themselves the End-of-Dayers. They use them on soft spots, trying to rip holes in the fabric of the universe. Trying to accelerate the end of days. I'm hoping if we can figure out how it's made and maybe trace the parts... we can stop them before it's too late.\nWALTER: Even if I could help you... I can't do it from here. I... would need my tools. My special instruments.\nPETER: We both know that's not going to happen.\n(Peter stares at the television screen and live coverage of a large vortex draining the Thames River. he stands up when he is joined in the plush office)\nPETER: Senator.\nBROYLES: Hello, Peter.\nPETER: Thank you for your time.\nBROYLES: No need for formality in here. It's good to see you. Have a seat. You said it was urgent.\nPETER: It is. I assume you've been briefed about the End of Days organization?\nBROYLES: I'm well aware of the situation, yes.\nPETER: We recovered this device from what's left of the Opera House. Science Division's been trying to crack the technology, but without much luck.\nBROYLES: What do you need?\nPETER: I need Walter. I want you to grant him a temporary furlough so he can help us on the case.\nBROYLES: That's out of the question. I'm sorry.\nPETER: If we can understand this technology, we might be able to prevent future attacks.\nBROYLES: Consult with him in prison if you need to. That's all I can offer.\nPETER: Why? You worried about your reelection prospects?\nBROYLES: You know me better than that. I'm worried about that. (points at the television screen) The entire globe is disintegrating. We're running around putting on band-aids, and every day more people are lost because of it, and Walter was responsible. I know him. And I know his intentions weren't this. But there's not a single person out there who hasn't lost someone they love because of him. You can't begrudge the anger they feel towards him.\nPETER: I don't. I'm out there in the streets with them every day. And, yeah, maybe I am running around putting band-aids on it until we can figure out how to reverse the damage that's already been done. But at least it's something. And if we can figure out this technology, I guarantee you we will prevent future casualties. Phillip. If what we lost in Detroit still means anything to you... just give me one chance. That's all I'm asking.\n(lights switch on)\nWALTER: (stares at the empty lab) Where are my things?\nPETER: They're all still in evidence, Walter. Don't worry. Olivia's on it. Your equipment will be here shortly.\nWALTER: Mm. Will Astrid be here?\nPETER: No. Astrid's a Fringe Agent now. We need her out in the field.\nWALTER: Oh. I suppose since she's no longer caring for me, she's able to (realizes his hands are chained) -- spread her wings. (whispers to Peter) May I take a look out back? My old office.\nMOVING STAFF: (from the main lab) Just leave him there for now. I'm not sure where he wants him.\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: I didn't realize how much I've missed swivel chairs. I've also missed swiveling.\nPETER: There's someone here to see you.\nWALTER: A visitor?\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: Olivia! Congratulations are in order, my Dear.\nOLIVIA: What for?\nWALTER: The wedding, of course.\nOLIVIA: Oh. That was a while ago now.\nWALTER: This is the first opportunity I've had to give you an appropriate welcome to our family. I always did want a daughter.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, Walter.\nWALTER: (to the Fringe agent) For goodness' sake! Doesn't the word fragile mean anything to you? (the box floats and safely lands on the floor) (to Olivia) Was that you?\nOLIVIA: I learned to control it a few years ago.\nWALTER: I'm impressed.\nMOREAU: So... what's the next target?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: The wormhole in Central Park.\nMOREAU: Considering your world was destroyed by a wormhole, I suppose it's fitting.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Is this it?\nMOREAU: Followed your specifications to the letter. More than twice the yield of the device we used last night.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It won't be long... 'til this world joins mine.\nPETER: (to Walter's security detail) Boys. (to Walter) Any luck? (puts a bag of licorice on the worktable)\nWALTER: Afraid not. Can't make any sense of this technology. I'll continue to run diagnostics on the canister, but even if I am successful, our world is still ending. You may stop this group, but you cannot stop the inevitable. Our destiny was set the day we triggered the machine. I didn't understand until it was too late that our... two worlds were inextricably linked. Without one, the other simply cannot exist. When their world was destroyed, that was the day we sealed our fate. For all intent and purposes... that was the day we died.\nPETER: We don't know that for sure.\nWALTER: Have you seen him?\nPETER: Walternate? No. Nobody has. He's become a recluse.\nWALTER: Imagine coming over here to try to save the world... only to be stuck here when your world was destroyed. Not to mention having the same face as the most reviled man in the universe. I just wanted to say... at the trial, you spoke on my behalf...\nPETER: ...Walter, I'm the one who got in the machine. I'm the one who destroyed the other universe.\nWALTER: The courts perceived that you did it... to defend our universe. And so do I. This all began with me, and my... hubris.\nPETER: Walter...\nWALTER: ...and I just wanted to say thank you.\nPETER: No matter who's at fault, you are my dad.\n(Peter leaves the lab. Walter picks out one licorice and takes a bite.)\nOLIVIA: (to her husband busy over a hot stove) That smells insanely good.\nPETER: After the day we had, I figured we deserved better than takeout.\nOLIVIA: Hey. How you holding up?\nPETER: Ha. I'm doing fine. Why?\nOLIVIA: Well... you know Walter would always cook when he was worried about you, so...\nPETER: Well, of all the bad habits I could pick up from him, that's the least of them. (looks at a child's drawing on the refrigerator door)\nOLIVIA: Amanda from across the street gave it to us. That's you and me and the little baby that we're gonna have that she is planning on babysitting.\nPETER: Oh... well, I think we should get started on that right away.\nOLIVIA: You're really gonna use a drawing from a little girl to get lucky?\nPETER: It sounds so dirty when you say it like that.\nOLIVIA: She's a sweet little girl.\nPETER: You know, Hon, if you wanted to reconsider...\nOLIVIA: I can't say that I don't think about it. And that I don't wish things were different.\nPETER: Honey, people still have families. Look at Amanda. She was born into this world, and she's still happy. And the world could get better. So I still think we're gonna have a kid.\nOLIVIA: I hope you're right.\nPETER: In fact, I think we're gonna have several. Two, maybe three. A little tribe of Bishops.\n(the next morning the phone rings while they slumber)\nPETER: (answers) Hello?\nWALTER: (calling from the lab) I understand now. They're splitting atoms... not as an outcome goal but as a means to an end.\nPETER: Slow down, Walter.\nWALTER: The diagnostics on the canister -- they show residual traces of Strontium 90. That's a radioactive isotope. That's how they're making the Electrilights.\nPETER: Which means it would leave a signature.\nWALTER: Yes! Like radioactive breadcrumbs. They'll lead us to whoever's doing this.\nPETER: (to Olivia) We need Science Division to monitor current radiation tracking maps.\nWALTER: It'll be faster if you exclude readings inconsistent with Strontium 90. Look for spikes in the remaining data.\nOLIVIA: This is a campground. Do you think it's even possible to split atoms here?\nPETER: I can see 'em making s'mores, maybe, but weapons of mass destruction? No.\nOLIVIA: Is this the right place?\nAGENT #2: The tracking system is detecting the same radioactive signature that registered on the canister.\nPETER: So then where's the lab?\nOLIVIA: (to her Agent) Okay. You keep searching. I'm gonna call this in. If you find anything out of the ordinary, I want to know.\nAGENT #2: Yes, ma'am.\nAGENT #3: (privately to Peter) Sir. We found this sitting on top of a rock. I don't know if it means anything.\nPETER: Thank you, Agent.\nAGENT #3: Sure.\nOLIVIA: Peter. (as he hides the key box he was handed) Maybe Walter was wrong about the radioactive signature.\nPETER: Yeah. I'll go back to Science Division, see if maybe something's wrong with the radiation detection sensors.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, let me know if you find anything.\nPETER: Yeah. Will do. (gets in his vehicle and opens the key box)\n(in Central Park, Moreau enters the restricted Amber zone and prepares to deploy two more Electrilight devices)\nASTRID: (looks at someone's abandoned lunch) How come no one respects my desk?\nNEARBY AGENT: You're too nice.\nLOUSPEAKER: (alarm goes off) Team One, get ready to deploy. Perimeter breach. Sector Eight in Central Park.\nWALTER: This technology's ten, maybe fifteen years ahead of its time. I don't mind saying it's something I would like to have invented. I mean for peaceful purposes. Mining, maybe.\nOLIVIA: Walter. What about the components?\nWALTER: Where were these parts made? I haven't the foggiest.\nOLIVIA: (answers ringing cell phone) Dunham. I'm on my way.\nWALTER: What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: There's been a security breach at the wormhole. Someone in the park I.D.'d Moreau. (to Ella) Come on.\n(approaches his old family summer home with the key left for him to find)\nPETER: (answers ringing cell phone) Hello? Hello? (no response. enters the cabin with his pistol drawn and finds the man that lured him there)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Hello, Peter.\nPETER: (puts the gun on the desk. sits in the nearby chair.) Why'd you leave me the key, Walter?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I knew you'd recognize it. I couldn't just call you.\nPETER: Yes, you could have.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: No, no, no, no. Not if I wanted the proper reunion that we both so richly deserve.\nPETER: So letting me know that Moreau works for you -- that was your way of getting my attention?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Among other things.\nPETER: I should have known that the Electrilight came from you. After all, Walter was the only one brilliant enough to figure out how it worked. Stands to reason that you were the only one brilliant enough to invent it. Yin and Yang.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: That's interesting. Interesting that you should say that -- Yin and Yang.\nPETER: Why are you doing this?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Yin and Yang. One man broke the universe. The other man did nothing.... but have his son stolen, his life stolen, ruined. I came over here at the end on a mission of mercy to ask for help for my side. The race was lost, a race I didn't initiate. But still, I came. And you destroyed us, Peter... my son. You destroyed your own...\nPETER: You activated the machine on your side. You were going to use it to destroy this universe. I only acted in self-defense.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Do you know what it's like... to wake up and just for a moment... think that everything is as it was? And then to realize it's not... that the nightmare you had was real. Soon everyone here will experience loss the way that all those over there did. Air, water... light, even. But you... you will experience loss the way I did.\nPETER: What does that mean?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You destroyed my universe, son, and I'm going to destroy yours. And not all at once.\nELLA: Peter's still not picking up.\nAGENT #4: Agent Dunham. We spotted a vehicle parked near the perimeter breach.\nOLIVIA: What kind of vehicle?\nAGENT #4: A bus.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I want all tactical teams to enter the restricted area -- (a flash knocks out all of the Fringe responders. Olivia recovers first and sees a cloudy, colorful vortex drifting from the Amber mound)\nPETER: I came here alone, Walter. To make a personal plea to you. I'm sorry for the suffering that I've caused you. I'm sorry... for destroying your people. Our people. I'm sorry for destroying our world. And if I could take back that choice... I would. But it's no excuse for what you're doing now. And it has to stop. I don't want to have to use these. But you're going to come with me now, Father.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You know, Peter, if I was really there, I might not be able to resist killing you. I think this is the better way, so you can learn about loss. Let's start by killing someone you love.\n(Peter grabs for him and his hand pass through him. he has been talking to a holographic projection. Secretary Bishop turns of the hologram device he is using and exits his vehicle parked near Olivia in Central Park)\nOLIVIA: (on her tactical radio) We're gonna evacuate the area, try and contain the wormhole. So can you move everyone back to Sector Three?\n(Secretary Bishop steps out from behind a vehicle and shoots Olivia in the forehead with a silenced pistol)\nPETER: Olivia Dunham... my wife... was everything to me.\n(Peter\u2019s eulogy for Olivia was originally covered by somber music... but available on DVD. \"When we first met, I was a nomad, moving from place-to-place, job-to-job. She gave me a purpose: She taught me to believe in something bigger than myself. She taught me to fight to keep our world safe, and more recently, to keep it from dying. The truth is \u2013- we\u2019re all dying. From the moment we\u2019re born, we are all dying, and the universe is unspeakably cruel. Our one hope is that we can find some purpose, some meaning before that last day comes. Some happiness... and love. Olivia was all of that to me. There was no one like her. While I will not cease to fight, now that she\u2019s gone, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m already lost. That we are all lost. The world is a darker place without her.\"\n(later, on the ride home)\nWALTER: Why have we stopped? What is this, some kind of protest?\nELLA: No. It's the wormhole. They're still trying to seal it up. Sergeant, when we start moving again, can we cut over and take Columbus, then we can --\nWALTER: Wait. No. Turn the car around. Please... I need to get back to my lab.\n(back at his home, Peter sits and drinks, then drinks some more - and grieves deeply)\nWALTER: Diagnostics are almost complete. You used to call me \"Uncle Walter\" do you remember?\nELLA: I don't remember much from before it got bad.\nWALTER: I'm so sorry... Ella. I understand... words can't come close to mitigating your loss. Truly, if I could go back in time and change things, I would. I would give anything to be able to go back and make different choices.\nELLA: But you can't. There aren't any happy endings nowadays, are there?\nWALTER: No. I suppose not.\nELLA: I remember the cow that stayed over there. She had kind eyes.\nWALTER: She did, didn't she? My Gene. I do miss her. Oh... that's it.\nWALTER: Peter, I was wrong. It's not too late. You can save both worlds. We can do it all over again. This time, you -- you simply need to make a different choice, and should something go wrong, then Olivia will be our fail-safe.\nPETER: Walter, stop. Olivia is dead.\nWALTER: But she won't be... Not then.\nPETER: The machine? I turned that on fifteen years ago.\nWALTER: And all the time I sat in prison, I - I - I couldn't figure out where it came from. I knew the pieces were buried millions of years ago, but how did they get there, so deep in the past? But now I understand. I sent them there. The wormhole in Central Park -- I sent them back through time. Peter, you can stop the destruction before it occurs!\nPETER: If that's the case, just don't send the machine back. Then we'll never discover it, and I'll never destroy the other universe.\nWALTER: No, no, no. It doesn't work that way. I have already done it. Therefore, I have no choice but to do it again.\nPETER: Walter, that doesn't make any sense.\nWALTER: It does. It's a paradox. I can't change what happens because it's already happened. But you can make a different choice within what happened. I simply need to find a way to bring your consciousness forward to now so that you can witness what will happen if you make the same choice. Peter, for all I know, it could be happening already. Don't you see? We can fix everything. We can cheat the rules of time.\nPETER: Imagine the repercussions.\nWALTER: There's no way of telling what the cost might be. But it can't be worse than this. It can't be worse than this.\nPETER: What would I need to do?\n(current times)\nOLIVIA: Walter? What's happening to him?\nWALTER: His heart rate's going up -- 156 and climbing!\nOLIVIA: What's it doing to him?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nBROYLES: It's been sixty seconds now. How much longer are we gonna let him stay inside that thing?\nWALTER: Peter has interfaced with the machine at a biological level. If we take him out prematurely, I'm afraid we'll harm him.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What is it?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Sir, it just started sixty seconds ago.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: What started exactly?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: The machine -- something is happening. The diagnostics are through the roof. Look at this -- the soft spots -- they're not closing. They're getting worse.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Bring me Olivia Dunham, now.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't understand what you're asking me to do.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: The drawing suggests that you have a connection with the machine... that you can stop it, that you can turn it off.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: They outsmarted you, didn't they? They know you turned the machine on. So they put Peter in theirs... and now we're the ones that are gonna get destroyed.\nWALTER: Something's wrong!\nOLIVIA: Help me, quick! Come on, let's move it! Peter.\nPETER: Olivia... you're alive.\nOLIVIA: Are you doing that?\nPETER: I understand now. Walter? Walter! I understand now. I understand what the machine does. I know what it's capable of, and I know where it came from.\nWALTER: The First People?\nPETER: Yes, The First People, Walter, but The First People are us -- you, most specifically and maybe Ella and Astrid -- I don't know. I don't know who it was that took the machine back through time. But I know something else. I've seen Doomsday, and it is worse than anything you could possibly imagine. This isn't a war that can be won. Our two worlds are inextricable. If one side dies, we all die. So I've torn holes in both the universes and they lead here, to this room. A bridge so that we can begin to work together to fix --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You shattered my universe. You have any idea how many deaths you've caused?\nWALTER: That was an accident. What you have tried to do you've done on purpose!\nOLIVIA: Whatever you've both done, we're here now. So maybe it's time we start to fix it.\nDECEMBER: You were right. They don't remember Peter.\nTHE OBSERVER: How could they? He never existed. He served his purpose."

I mean, simple things like principles, honor, honesty... all fundamental requirements in an accord. If you can't trust the people you're dealing with, what then?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, maybe I'm not the problem. Maybe it's you. Maybe you are just incapable of trust.\nOLIVIA: Interesting. Coming from the person who kidnapped me and stole my life.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, being you and living your life only made me more homesick for my universe. Must be hard to develop trust in people when all you've got is yourself. (snarky) Must get terribly lonely.\nOLIVIA: (dead-eye stare) Just because you walked in my shoes, don't you think for a moment that you know me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. Keep telling yourself that.\nOLIVIA: Happy reading. I'm sure you'll find a lot of the cases familiar since you and your people were responsible.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Huh. Funny. I was just gonna say the same thing to you.\n(each takes a storage box and walk in opposite directions)\n(the Observer enters the quaint dining facility, removes his hat and sits with his colleague. the staff is busy in the kitchen)\nCHEF: (busy in the kitchen) Just prep that dozen.\nCOOK: I got some in the walk-in. I can check.\nTHE OBSERVER: (somberly) I received your message.\nDECEMBER: Then you know we have a problem.\nTHE OBSERVER: (emphatic) It is impossible. The timeline has been rewritten. He was erased. And yet traces of him continue to bleed through.\nDECEMBER: It is, as it has always been, our responsibility to insure events play out, as they were intended, before your intervention. This started with you. It must be you who ends it. (hands over a small metallic bar)\nCHEF: (busy in the kitchen) You okay with that grill?\nCOOK: Yeah, it's good. Give it a few more minutes.\nDECEMBER: They can never know the boy lived to be a man.\nTHE OBSERVER: I will take care of it.\n(answers the knock at the door in his dress shirt, tie and boxer shorts - while finishing breakfast)\nROBERT DANZIG: I'm ready. Toaster was acting up.\nAGENT LEE: What? Then don't eat toast. You ever heard of cereal? (enters the house and is greeted by the children)\nAMY DANZIG: (big hug) Lincoln!\nAGENT LEE: Oh, she got me! (picks the 6 year-old up and carries her into the other room)\nAMY DANZIG: Lincoln, why don't you like toast?\nAGENT LEE: I like toast. But, you see, toast takes time. And if too much time goes by, then we don't catch any bad guys, and if we don't catch the bad guys, there might not be any toast. So it's your dad who must not like toast.\nJONATHAN DANZIG: (childish tangent) Want to see a frog?\nJULIE DANZIG: (mom enters from another room) Jonathan! If I have to tell you one more time to pick up that backpack and get going...\nJONATHAN DANZIG: The toaster was late. I'm a victim in this.\nAGENT LEE: Oh, my gawd.\nJULIE DANZIG: Hi, Lincoln. (kiss on the cheek)\nAGENT LEE: Jules.\nJULIE DANZIG: (to the kids) Alright, come on. Let's go. (to Lee) Did you eat?\nAGENT LEE: I did. Early. (sarcastically) Like Robert was supposed to.\nROBERT DANZIG: You know, they did a study on sarcastic people and they get more illnesses in their lifetime.\nAGENT LEE: Is that right?\nROBERT DANZIG: It had something to do with negative energy.\nAMY DANZIG: Bye, Dad.\nJULIE DANZIG: Love you. (kisses Robert good-bye)\nROBERT DANZIG: Love you.\nJULIE DANZIG: Bye, Lincoln.\nAGENT LEE: You ever wonder where you'd be without me? (throws trousers at his partner) Put your pants on.\nROBERT DANZIG: Don't worry. We're not gonna be late.\n(Agents Lee and Danzig chase an armed suspect on foot through a maze of buildings and across rooftops in a dilapidated industrial area. the suspect alludes capture in the steam tunnels of one building and forces the FBI men to split-up and pursue separately. Danzig hears a noise ahead in the corridor, and follows. Lee climbs a ladder to a different floor, enters a workshop and immediately has a pistol placed to the side of his head)\nSUSPECT: Don't move.\n(Lee blocks the pistol hand of the suspect, the pistol fires behind him and he flips the suspect onto the floor with a martial arts drag. Lee immediately handcuffs the man and loudly announces into the corridor behind him)\nAGENT LEE: Robert, he's down! (having not received a response, he walks into the hallway) Robert!\n(Lee climbs back down the metal ladder and begins to track the path his partner took through the building. in another workshop he finds a semi-translucent man hovering over a motionless Danzig laying on the floor. he draws his pistol)\nAGENT LEE: Hey!\n(the translucent man disconnects the device he attached to Danzig, runs and jumps through the large window nearby and all the way to, and through, the large window in an adjacent building thirty feet away)\nAGENT LEE: Robert. (returns to his petrified partner and watches as Danzig's skin fades in and out of translucency)\n(Olivia and Astrid arrive at the Danzig murder scene in Connecticut and are met and led to the deceased Agent, already in a body bag in the ambulance)\nOLIVIA: (to the agent that greets them) Olivia Dunham.\nAGENT #1: Come with me.\n(inside the ambulance, Olivia unzips the body bag and checks the state of the corpse)\nOLIVIA: (to Astrid) Go ahead.\nASTRID: (climbs into the ambulance with her new audio\/video earpiece that links back to Walter in his lab) Doctor Bishop, it's me. I'm at the -- Ow! (as the device squeals loudly with feedback) -- Gah!\n(continuing her investigation apart from Astrid)\nOLIVIA: Where's the victim's partner?\nAGENT #1: That's him there. (points across the way some) That's Agent Lee.\nOLIVIA: Great. Thank you. (walks to Lee and offers a handshake) Agent Lee... Olivia Dunham.\n(two bald, well-dressed gents with Fedoras watch and comment from nearby)\nJANUARY: (about Lee and Dunham) He used to know her.\nTHE OBSERVER: Yes. Before things changed.\n(continuing her interview)\nOLIVIA: I understand that you and your partner were in pursuit of a suspect.\nAGENT LEE: We were tracking the sale of some illegal weapons.\nOLIVIA: I was hoping to ask you some questions about what you saw.\nAGENT LEE: Sure. (pauses) Who are you?\nOLIVIA: I'm from a special Division. I'm not at liberty to disclose anymore than that. So the person who attacked your partner, can you describe him?\nAGENT LEE: When I first got there, he was kneeling over Robert. I couldn't tell what he was doing, but his skin was... translucent. It's like what you see on Robert's face, but more of it.\nOLIVIA: And when he was kneeling over Agent Danzig, did you see anything in his hands like a device or anything that could have done this?\nAGENT LEE: (sullen) No, I didn't see anything. I've requested a Field Office M.E. He's on the way. He's good. He's thorough.\nOLIVIA: Thank you, but we're going to take the remains back to our facility.\nAGENT LEE: Wait a minute. (growing indignant) You're telling -- that's my partner.\nOLIVIA: (consoling) I understand how you feel.\nAGENT LEE: (angered) You're some Division coming in here and taking over? You won't even tell me who you are?\nOLIVIA: I can assure you that this case will take --\nAGENT LEE: -- Have you seen the suspect before? Do you know who he is?\nOLIVIA: I'm not at liberty to discuss this.\nAGENT LEE: (slightly enraged) This is my partner we're talking about here. Maybe you can't understand that. I'd like to talk to someone else.\nOLIVIA: There is no one else. There is just me. (heartfelt) I am sorry for your loss.\n(Lee follows Dunham as she prepares to drive-off and quickly memorizes her license plate number. the two Observers stroll away from the area)\nWALTER: (dissatisfied and grumpy) Maybe it's the air. Have you checked the temperature?\nASTRID: It is exactly the same as it always is, Walter -- seventy-two degrees and ten percent humidity.\nWALTER: (fussy) Maybe the barometric pressure. You can't tell me there's not something different in here. This whole place has felt funny for the last week.\nASTRID: Walter, it's been a week since we agreed to work with the other side.\nWALTER: And that's another thing. That man cannot be trusted. I don't care what he says. I have looked into his eyes. Into his soul. And who would know him better than me?\nASTRID: Don't forget, Walter. He has plenty of reasons to hate you too.\n(Gene offers Walter a plaintive stare. Olivia sits in her office and researches Danzig's file)\nASTRID: (loudly from the lab) I know you're not happy about this, but we're supposed to be going through these case files.\nWALTER: (loudly from the lab) Fine. I'll help you with the case files as soon as I'm done here, but don't expect me to like it. (Agent Lee finds his way into the corridor outside of lab and listens to the elevated conversation) All I'm saying, and I've been very consistent about this, is that there has to be another way.\nWALTER: (as Agent Lee enters the lab) The thing about playing Devil's Advocate, my Dear, is that your client is the Devil himself.\nASTRID: Walter, we're fixing the world. What other choice do we have? Thank God that machine didn't blow everybody up. You know, it could have.\nAGENT LEE: (approaches Walter) Excuse me.\nWALTER: (hands him a dead bird) Here. Hold this.\nAGENT LEE: I'm looking --\nWALTER: Shh. Shh. Shh. (injects the dead animal with a serum) Three, two, one. (the bird starts to fly around the room)\nASTRID: (returning with a storage box) Walter... you brought it back to life.\nWALTER: (matter-of-factly) No, no, no. It's still quite dead. (delighted) It's wonderful, isn't it?\nAGENT LEE: (slightly intimidated) Who are you people?\nOLIVIA: (leaves her office. miffed at the intrusion by Lee) What the Hell are you doing here?\nWALTER: (as the bird returns to its' inanimate state and falls to the floor. rock hard) Huh. There's still a few kinks to work out, but it's a start.\n(Lee and Olivia check each other out silently after his breach of professional protocol and science team security)\nOLIVIA: (looking at photos of her vehicle that Lee used to track her back to Boston) Tapping into traffic camera feeds without a warrant. You and whoever helped you with this is in a lot of trouble. You are not a part of this investigation. (vehement) You need to leave.\nAGENT LEE: I have spent the last two hours going building to building. I am not leaving here without some answers. What Division are you in? (demanding) What are we dealing with here?\nASTRID: (answers ringing phone) Hello?\nOLIVIA: (dismissive) I'll just give your Division head a call.\nAGENT LEE: I see. It's good to know we have reception. (threatening treason) See, I have a friend at the New York Times would love to know that there is a Division of the FBI operating out of Harvard with a man who can make dead birds fly.\nASTRID: (returns with phone. to Olivia) It's for you. It's Broyles.\nWALTER: (engaging Agent Lee as Olivia steps away to take the phone call) If you really want a story, you should look under the dome. I'm growing an ear.\nOLIVIA: (returns after call) There's another body. (to Astrid) Let's go.\nAGENT LEE: (imposing himself) I'm coming with you.\nOLIVIA: (getting fed-up) You keep going like this, and you're gonna talk yourself out of the Bureau.\nAGENT LEE: I was at the first crime scene. Maybe I saw something that I haven't told you yet. (trying to seem valuable) Maybe that's why I came here.\nOLIVIA: (thinks for a few seconds) Okay, come. You can get fired later.\nASTRID: Hey, Walter, where's the --\nWALTER: Here. I fixed the squelching. (hands her the camera earpiece she uses at crime scenes) It should be fine now.\nASTRID: Thank you. (hurries to join Olivia)\n(lights and sirens fill the night as first responders and investigators secure the area around a crashed vehicle containing a dead woman. the science team, with Agent Lee in-tow, pass under the police perimeter tape and approach the on-scene lead agent)\nOLIVIA: So what do we have?\nAGENT #2: One female, approximately thirty years-old.\nOLIVIA: Any witnesses?\nAGENT #2: There were some people in the street over there. Some kids.\nOLIVIA: (illuminates the semi-translucent woman with her flashlight) Did anyone see what happened after the crash?\nAGENT #2: No. But we should have some background on her by now.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (moves away from the crashed vehicle toward the nearby park)\nASTRID: (into her audio\/camera earpiece as she sets-up her equipment) Walter. Walter, are you there? Walter, hello? (in his lab, Bishop is fixing some popcorn and listening to loud music) Walter. Walter, can you hear me?\nWALTER: (settles at his workstation to help remotely) I'm here. The microwave was causing a disturbance. I can hear you perfectly. You're as clear as a bell. How's the squelching?\nASTRID: It sounds great.\nWALTER: (looks at the monitor with video feed from Astrid's headset) I'd like to see the body. Chop, chop. (about the nearby forensics technician) Don't let that ham-fist touch her.\nASTRID: (filtering Walter's message and relaying it to the technician) If you don't mind holding off for a moment, I'd just like to do a preliminary.\nWALTER: (studying the monitor while munching on his snack) Burn mark like the other victims. Pupils are dilated. That looks like a hematoma on her right clavicle.\nASTRID: Yeah, and her right jaw.\nWALTER: Rigidity indicates premature rigor mortis. I need to check her anus. Have that large lady there help you lift her.\nASTRID: (filtering Walter's message again and gingerly requesting) I'm going to -- I'm going to need to check her anus.\nCSI TECH: (slowly. nodding) Okay.\nASTRID: Thank you.\n(standing away from the crashed vehicle and conferring)\nAGENT LEE: So what do we know about her?\nOLIVIA: (looking at an enlarged copy of the victim's drivers license) Her name was Nadine Park. She was a commuter. She parked her car at the train station, which is about four blocks from here, at ten forty-five this morning. She was still behind the wheel, so maybe he was waiting for her in the back seat. He wanted to attack her when there was no one else around. She struggled for a bit and then hit the lamppost.\nAGENT LEE: (studies the gathered crowd at the edge of the park) They all said they didn't see anything?\nOLIVIA: That's right.\nAGENT LEE: (focusing on the one person sitting alone and still) One of these things is not like the other.\nOLIVIA: Hi. I'm Agent Dunham. (approaches the intimidated teenager Lee was focusing on and sits beside her on the park bench)\nEYEWITNESS: Hi. (hesitant)\nOLIVIA: What's your name?\nEYEWITNESS: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: How do you like that? That's my name too. Did you see the crash?\nEYEWITNESS: I heard it.\nOLIVIA: Did you see anything after the crash? 'Cause your friends said that they were out in the field but that you were here on the street. So I was kind of hoping that maybe you saw something they didn't.\nEYEWITNESS: I don't want to get in trouble.\nOLIVIA: (reassuring) Okay, you're not gonna get into trouble, I promise.\nEYEWITNESS: I was talking to my boyfriend. I came out to the street to get reception.\nOLIVIA: What did you see? (looks at the image of a translucent man the eyewitness captured with her cell phone. returns to Lee and comments) Now we have a picture. Nice catch.\nAGENT LEE: Thanks. (slight sarcasm) Imagine what I could do with more information. Freaky see-through killer, two apparently unrelated murders.\nOLIVIA: It's not just two. (giving him the additional information he was hoping for as they cross back under the perimeter tape.\nAGENT BROYLES: (enters a hallway, passes an armed guard and joins Olivia and her guest as they wait) Agent Lee, I'm Agent Phillip Broyles. (hands Lee a stack of documents to sign)\nAGENT LEE: What are these?\nAGENT BROYLES: The first one raises your clearance. The second you're acknowledging you'll be prosecuted if you speak about what we're seeing here. (leads his visitor into a large storage area with two dozen tables supporting bodies covered with white sheets) The first attacks were three days ago. All we know is their hearts stopped.\nAGENT LEE: All of these in three days?\nAGENT BROYLES: We don't know what happened to them, what he does to affect their skin this way, and what the hell he's getting out of this. We assume there must be some common link between the victims, but we can't find it. Different ages, races, blood types, some had high cholesterol, some didn't.\nAGENT LEE: Cholesterol levels?\nAGENT BROYLES: (admittedly) We're looking for anything.\nAGENT LEE: (matter-of-fact) Robert had Crohn's Disease. He took iron pills. (to Olivia after Broyles steps out) We were partners for five years. (thoughtful eulogy) He was like family. Something I never thought I'd find. He believed that everything happened for a reason. (angered) I'm having a hard time believing that there's a reason for this.\n(the Observer walks slowly through a small neighborhood store specializing in consumer electronic components and replacement parts. he approaches a work bench with a large sub-assembly resting on it, places his finger near a small electronic component, zaps it with static, then removes it for purchase)\nSHOP OWNER: (returning from a side storage area) Mister, I think I found what you're looking for. An electron gun from a '58 Color RCA. I had to take apart the cathode ray tube to get to it, so I'm gonna have to charge you full-price for the TV.\nTHE OBSERVER: Yes. (holds up the part he just pilfered) I will take this as well.\nSHOP OWNER: (looks over the shopping basket the bald man is carrying) Mind my asking what you need all this stuff for?\nTHE OBSERVER: (understated) I need to erase someone from time.\nOLIVIA: (entering the lab and meeting the agents rolling in the gurney and victim that Astrid brought back for Walter to autopsy) Just there is great, guys. Thank you.\nASTRID: Hey. Have you seen Walter? I can't find him. I went out to get him a sandwich, and when I got back, he was gone.\nOLIVIA: Where would he go? He's afraid to leave the lab.\nASTRID: Then maybe he locked himself in the bathroom again?\nOLIVIA: I'll check Gene's stall. (starts searching the lab)\nASTRID: Okay. Walter!\n(Agent Lee stands over the body bag and waits for his fellow agents to return. he looks around when he hears clanking and splashing coming from the sensory deprivation tank nearby)\nWALTER: (opening the doors and climbing out) Is it safe to come out? Is he gone?\nAGENT LEE: Who?\nWALTER: The man! Is he gone?\nAGENT LEE: I don't know. I think it's just me and Agents Dunham and --\nWALTER: (frightened) Oh... There was -- there was a man in the mirror. And when I turned around, he wasn't there. I saw him.\nASTRID: Walter.\nWALTER: Listen, Astrid, there is a man in the mirror.\nASTRID: If you're talking about Agent Lee, you met him earlier.\nWALTER: (angered) Not him! There was another man. (emphatic) He was here, and then he was gone. I saw him!\nOLIVIA: Walter, Walter, it's okay. (making the peace) Look, whatever it was, we're all here now, and you're okay. You're okay. (comforting)\nASTRID: Walter, look at you. You're soaking wet. We've got to get you out of those clothes.\nAGENT LEE: (following Olivia toward her office) Is he alright?\nOLIVIA: Well, that depends on your definition of \"alright\". He's functional. Except when he's not. But he is often quite brilliant. He just never had anything to tether him to the world.\n(later, as he starts to inspect the corpse of Nadine Park. still damp and wearing only a towel around his waist)\nWALTER: That is sad.\nOLIVIA: What is?\nWALTER: Engagement ring. I don't think there's anything sadder than when two people are meant to be together and something intervenes. (jumps as the dot matrix printer begins to whir)\nASTRID: Hey, Walter, it's okay. It's okay. It's just your test results.\nWALTER: Question, dear. That man? (checking for a name)\nASTRID: Agent Lee.\nWALTER: I believe it was your idea, Agent Lee, to test each of the victims for iron-related diseases, that they may share that in common. Very clever. Wrong, but clever.\nAGENT LEE: Well, it was just a long shot.\nWALTER: And yet, interestingly, they do all suffer from a variety of health problems -- gout, hair loss, kidney diseases, which, in themselves, have something in common. (whispers to Astrid) I'm not wearing pants.\nASTRID: I'm on it.\nOLIVIA: Which is what, Walter?\nWALTER: They're all caused by some form of heavy metal poisoning. Lead, Zinc, Mercury. (accepts a pair of trousers from Astrid) Thank you, dear.\nAGENT LEE: And what could that possibly mean?\nWALTER: I don't know, but, with thirty odd victims, it's unlikely that it's a coincidence. And something else -- the levels of metal in their bodies have returned to normal. It's as if their blood has been cleaned.\nOLIVIA: So, what, you're saying he's taking particles from their blood? Why? For what possible reason?\nWALTER: I don't have enough information to form a hypothesis yet. But it would seem he needs a lot of it.\n(alone in a remote industrial building, the translucent perpetrator prepares a syringe, then injects himself. after the shot, he opens his notebook and writes a few comments)\nOLIVIA: (on her cell phone) If Walter's right and we assume that he is selecting these victims on purpose, then the question is, how is he identifying them?\nWALTER: (fully dressed and in autopsy mode over Nadine Park) In this case, tissue's soft. No indurations. Fat to lean muscle ratio -- ideal, about twenty percent.\nAGENT LEE: Is that relevant?\nWALTER: To this case? Not at all. It just means that she will make a lovely specimen. Finding healthy tissue for experimentation's harder than you might imagine.\nAGENT LEE: You mean you aren't returning these people to their families?\nOLIVIA: We can't do that.\nAGENT LEE: Why not?\nOLIVIA: Because we can't disclose how they were killed. The families are informed that they have gone missing, that we will continue to look for them --\nAGENT LEE: You mean you lie to them.\nOLIVIA: Look, I'm sorry, but --\nAGENT LEE: You understand what you're saying? (morally offended by the protocol) Those families are going to spend the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their loved ones, looking for answers. Can you imagine what that would be like? To have that... that hole in your life.\nWALTER: (resolved) People die. It happens. Sometimes they even die twice.\nOLIVIA: The reason we can't return the bodies is because that would mean we would have to file documentation, which would draw attention to Fringe Division. And we cannot have that. It may not be a good enough answer, but it is the truth.\nASTRID: (from her computer workstation) Listen to this. One of the victims' credit cards just registered a charge. Dead people do not use their credit cards.\nWALTER: Of course they do. Certainly.\nOLIVIA: So you think it's the translucent man? (joins Astrid at the monitor)\nASRTRID: Mm-hmm.\nOLIVIA: Can you track it?\nASTRID: Never mind. It's a false alarm. It's a commuter pass being auto-renewed as a monthly charge.\nAGENT LEE: (connecting the clues) The killer picked up his last victim in the commuter rail parking lot.\nOLIVIA: (later, after plotting the victim locations on her evidence board) We were wrong. Pattern's not random at all. Four kill zones, all centered around the commuter rail stations. Astrid, call Broyles. (marching to the lab door to exit) Lee, you come with me. Tell him to get that photograph out to all the station police, and also we're gonna need another three teams of agents to watch the stations.\nAGENT LEE: Where are we going?\n(in his remote facility, the translucent man continues his notations and calculations. his hand begins to tremor violently and the flesh in his forearm and hand begin to flux in and out of transparency. one of his fingernails draws his attention and he pulls it off of the finger. he studies the fingernail closely, then smiles at what he notices)\n(agents have established observation positions and the various commuter stations where many have recently gone missing)\nTAC ONE: Team One, nothing to report.\nTAC TWO: Team Two, all quiet here too.\nTAC THREE: Team Three, same. No sign of the suspect.\nOLIVIA: (sitting in her vehicle on stakeout. uncomfortable silence then the sharing of personal info) Just so you know, I know what it's like. I lost a partner too. About three years ago. There was an event on a plane. And at first we thought it was terrorism. During the investigations, my partner was injured. What happened to him was horrific and unexplainable. It affected his skin. Like your partner, but different. And Walter Bishop was in a mental institution at the time. I checked him out, so that he could help catch whoever did this and... and save my partner's life. But even Walter couldn't save him.\nAGENT ROACH: (loudly over the tactical radio from another stakeout) This is Roach. We've got him. Grove Hall Station!\n(Olivia drives quickly from her stakeout to join the pursuit at another commuter station)\n(the agents that located the suspect drive from the commuter station into a large industrial neighborhood with warehouses, shops and rail tracks and tanker vehicles)\nAGENT ROACH: (observing from the passenger seat) He's headed for the industrial line, back by the chemical lab.\nAGENT FRAZIER: I lost him. I lost him.\nAGENT ROACH: There. (points)\n(Frazier stops the vehicle and the two men continue on foot)\nAGENT ROACH: (on the tactical radio) He's running toward the warehouse, through the rail lines.\nOLIVIA: (responding to the update) Copy. We're almost there.\nAGENT ROACH: (stalking the suspect with pistol drawn) What if he goes out the other side?\nAGENT FRAZIER: You take the near side -- (grabbed and dragged back between the multiple rail cars)\nAGENT ROACH: Frazier! (on his radio) Frazier's down. Aagh!\n(Olivia and Agent Lee arrive. stop the car and join the foot pursuit with pistols drawn. they find a non-responsive Frazier laying on the tracks under a rail vehicle, and a shot and bleeding Roach nearby)\nOLIVIA: He's been shot. He's gonna bleed out if we don't get him help.\nAGENT LEE: Alright, go. Check the warehouse. If he's still here, you don't let him get away. I got this. (takes off his tie and starts to tourniquet the bloody left thigh of Roach)\n(inside the large nearby warehouse, Olivia slowly works her way through the building to apprehend her suspect. in the area he had been conducting his experiments, the translucent man starts to burn the documentation he had been accumulating.\nOLIVIA: Don't move. (approaches the man just as he closes his briefcase) Drop it. Drop -- (as she is clobbered by the briefcase he is swinging in self-defense)\n(Olivia and her pistol go flying. with his superior strength he hurtles her into the walls and through the upright shelving. she manages to find a loose syringe and stab him in the neck, but to no effect. he throws her into some large storage barrels, she finds her pistol nearby then turns and empties a clip of bullets into her assailant. outside, Lee hears the weapons' discharge and climbs onto one of the railcars to see inside the warehouse. he sees that Olivia has prevailed, climbs down off the car and returns to caring for Roach)\nAGENT LEE: Hey.\nAGENT ROACH: It took --\nAGENT LEE: (consoling) It's okay. You're okay. An ambulance is on the way.\nAGENT ROACH: (pained) It took my gun.\nAGENT LEE: It's okay. It's all over.\nAGENT ROACH: There's more than one.\n(Lee turns to see someone trying to evade detection in the distance. he draws his pistol and pursues the suspect alone through the rail yard. close to the man he is tracking, Lee steps from behind a railcar only to have to instantly fire on the semi-translucent male that is preparing to shoot him)\nSUSPECT: Unh! (as he dies from the three shots that caught him in the chest)\n(after the police, EMT's and other responders have arrived)\nAGENT LEE: (looking at the hybrid in the body bag that resembles his former partner) Who are these... things? What were they looking for?\nOLIVIA: I think the better question is, what are they?\n(nearby, a shifter resembling Nadine Park stands on the access stairs of a large fuel storage tank and watches the law enforcers below as they work the crime scene. her skin fades in and out of translucency before she turns and hikes up the stairs and away from capture)\n(in his office, Agent Lee opens a small wood box holding important keepsakes from his late partner, Agent Danzig. Lee takes out the man's ID card and studies it one last time in quiet reflection. as he secures the keepsakes in his travel bag, a colleague approaches and hands him an envelope with important paperwork. Lee removes the certified papers and learns the news)\nOLIVIA: Anything? (to Astrid as she tries to reconstitute the documents the translucent man was destroying)\nASTRID: Nothing that I can make sense of. It's all too badly burned.\nWALTER: The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. We used to have the book at Saint Claire's. The mental hospital where I lived for...\nASTRID: ...seventeen years. (slightly rude)\nOLIVIA: What about the book, Walter?\nWALTER: We used to read it every Wednesday. This reminds me of the book. A spy burning his things, covering his tracks. (to the new guy walking in the door) Agent Lee. Did you happen to bring any candy? Gumdrops perhaps?\nAGENT LEE: (unaware of the non-standard protocol) Candy? Um, no.\nWALTER: That's a pity. Astrid. Where are the scalpels?\nOLLIVIA: (to Lee) Long drive. Hope the Bureau's not gonna give you a hard time about putting miles on their car. (pressing for a return smile)\nAGENT LEE: (smile granted) I wanted to thank you for releasing Robert's body. (sincere) I know you must have pulled some... significant strings. Why would you do that for me?\nOLIVIA: (sharing her hard earned wisdom) I know you haven't found the answers you were looking for yet, but I hope that it brings a kind of closure, a closure that he deserves. Because of what he meant to you.\nAGENT LEE: Thank you.\nWALTER: Well... have a look at this. (removes a component the size of a deck of cards from the corpse of the translucent man) Does this remind you of anything? A biological-mechanical hybrid. These are different. They're human. And for whatever reason, they don't work.\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you suggesting that these are...\nWALTER: I told you! (spitting venom at Secretary Bishop) I told you that man couldn't be trusted!\nAGENT LEE: (clueless) What is he talking about?\nASTRID: (interdicting the venom) Walter, don't jump to conclusions. We don't know that for sure.\nWALTER: (gravely concerned) All I do know is that this tech isn't from here.\nAGENT LEE: Not from here? (totally clueless) You mean like China?\nOLIVIA: No. Not China. (becomes as concerned as Walter)\nOLIVIA: (approaches the security checkpoint) Sergeant, I need an I.D. for Agent Lincoln Lee.\nSERGEANT PALMER: Yes, ma'am. (to Lee, points at bio-scan reader) Place your hand right here, please, sir. (Lee complies) Badge number?\nAGENT LEE: B-M-P-1-2-2-2-9-8.\nSERGEANT PALMER: Blood type? (types in responses)\nAGENT LEE: Uh, B-Positive.\nSERGEANT PALMER: Are you currently on any medications?\nAGENT LEE: No.\nSERGEANT PALMER: Do you have a history of mental illness?\nAGENT LEE: (fidgets) This is getting oddly personal. But no.\nSERGEANT PALMER: (polite) Thank you, sir.\nOLIVIA: (as the Sergeant hands over a fresh access card and unlocks the inner passageway) Thank you. (inside, she and Lee travel a corridor with busy personnel and monitors. they turn a corner and Get Smart their way through another access door, pick-up a security detail and stop for screening. to Lee) Just wait.\nSCANNING DEVICE: Initiate scan.\nAGENT LEE: What is this? (as the lights in the room change dramatically and the scanning process begins)\nSCANNING DEVICE: Please remain still.\nOLIVIA: What you said before... I know what it's like to have a hole in my life. (passing along the real 4-1-1 info) It's been there as long as I can remember. I told you about the incident on the plane. After that, Broyles asked us to join Fringe Division, and somehow I knew that this is where I would find....\nAGENT LEE: What?\nOLIVIA: My answers.\n(the access doors to the joint-facility opens in front of them and a few personnel in iso-suits walk past. directly across from these access doors are another set of identical access doors facing them)\nAGENT LEE: What's beyond the door?\nOLIVIA: (invoking a truism) Well, sometimes answers lead to more questions.\n(Lee takes a deep breath and steps into the large space that Peter created to save the universes. Lee looks around and sees the large Wave Sink device at one end of the building. overhead, the mostly cloudy daytime sky of the alternate universe peeks through the windows. the windows over the doors he just came through show the only partly cloudy skies over his New York Harbor. Lee turns to the access doors from the alternate universe and is stunned when the red-haired identical twin of the FBI Agent he just spent two days working with comes strolling up.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (approaches. barely acknowledges this universe's Lincoln Lee. smugly to Olivia) Heh. I hear you got something to show me. What is it?\nOLIVIA: (hands over the hybrid technology that Walter uncovered) It was powering a new form of shapeshifters.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Shapeshifters?\nOLIVIA: Human shapeshifters. The ones we've encountered before answered to Walternate. You were wondering why I don't trust you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (snickers dismissively) I'll look into it.\n(Lee is astonished as a large dirigible airship fills the window looking in to the alternate universe)\n(outside of Walter's lab in the Kresge Building in Boston, The Observer sits on a campus bench and prepares to employ the device he has recently taken the time to build from scratch with hard to find electronic components. inside, Walter prepares for bed and makes his way past his security detail to bed down for the night in his office)\nFBI AGENT: 'nite Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: 'nite Tommy.\nFBI AGENT: It's Tim, sir.\nWALTER: Good night, Timmy.\n(Walter gulps down his drink and tucks into the fold-out bed that crowds his office)\nTV INFOMERCIAL: (playing quietly in the background) Look how easy it is. I'm just gonna put it in the center like this, okay, and slide it all the way through. I'll put the platform on here. I'll put the top on. And, as you can see...\n(outside the lab, The Observer powers-up his device and is about to activate it when he has a change of heart. he powers-down the machine, closes the container it is in, stands, prepares to leave, stops, looks at the building and thinks about what he was going to do Walter, then turns and leaves the area)\nTV INFOMERCIAL: (playing quietly in the background) Anybody can do this. I'll put it in my machine and... Set it and forget it! Eighteen minutes a pound for a pork loin roast--\nWALTER: (remotely turns off the television from bed then looks at the screen a few seconds later) Oh! Aah! (a latent image of Peter Bishop is staring back at him. Agent Tim hurries into the room and comforts Walter as he crouches in the fetal position on the edge of the bed) I saw him again. The man. I saw him. He was in the TV. (which Walter has now shattered) It was the man from the mirror."

We'd go camping... in the White Mountains... in the summer.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: Who took the picture?\nJEREMY ROMAN: My mom. I remember she was laughing.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: (fishing for positive thoughts) Did you have a good relationship with her?\nJEREMY ROMAN: I miss her very much. (strains into negative thinking)\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: Ah, ah, ah. Let's go... back to the picture. (turns the knob on a machine. blue liquid flows through the tube connected to the victim's brain) And... tell me what else happened that day.\nJEREMY ROMAN: We begged her... (body shivers. seemingly exulted)\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: Take your time. It's almost over.\nJEREMY ROMAN: My brothers and I... we begged her to keep it. (the large turtle he is holding in the childhood photo) We wore her down. (grunting) She said yes. We named him Fred.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: (fishing for positive thoughts) How did that make you feel?\nJEREMY ROMAN: Happy.\n(the interrogator looks-on as his latest victim passes into death, an instant icy corpse)\nWALTER: (preaching to the new guy, Lee, about hybrids. walks slowly toward a table of reflective lab ware) Let me tell you about them. They are horrid creatures. Vile. Part organic tissue, (covers the table with a large cloth sheet to hide the reflections) part machine. It's like everything from over there. They are loathsome. Hateful. Contemptible. (looks at himself in the mirror. finds a new cloth to cover the reflection)\nASTRID: (walks-in and hears the sermon) Contemptible? (to Agent Lee) Is he doing the synonym thing again?\nAGENT LEE: (stops studying documents at his workstation) Uh, he was telling me about the shape-shifters, and now he's moved on to the other universe , in general.\nWALTER: Immoral. Evil.\nASTRID: (motherly, annoyed) Walter, we have been over this. What is in the past is in the past. We have agreed to move forward.\nWALTER: Even I don't have drugs strong enough to forget they kidnapped Olivia to the other side.\nAGENT LEE: (unaware) They did?\nWALTER: For weeks, that awful woman pranced around my lab.\nAGENT LEE: (softly to Astrid) Awful woman?\nASTRID: Uh, the other Olivia. The one from over there.\nAGENT LEE: Oh.\nWALTER: She bought my ignorance with baked goods while she carried out her plan to steal pieces of the machine with the -- it was that damn Portuguese sweet bread.\nAGENT LEE: You mean the machine that created the bridge?\nWALTER: Yes. But that was not their intent. What they expected was for our world to be destroyed. Annihilated --\nASTRID: Walter. (stressing) It did not happen.\nWALTER: That doesn't mean that I have to like them. (covers the computer monitor with a towel. points across the lab) There's another mirror in the back storage cabinet. Kennedy, help me.\nAGENT LEE: (clarifies) Lincoln.\nASTRID: (softly) Thank you.\nAGENT LEE: No... problem.\nWALTER: (at a distant) Quickly!\nOLIVIA: (enters the lab with a large coffee and an upbeat mood) Morning.\nASTRID: Hi.\nOLIVIA: (looks around and chuckles) What's with the redecoration?\nASTRID: (answers the question posed) Walter. (continues organizing documents) Hey, don't look at me like I have some reasonable explanation. It's Walter.\nOLIVIA: Is Lincoln here already?\nASTRID: Mm-hmm. You did tell him he could come by to learn about shape-shifters, right?\nOLIVIA: (surprised) Mm-hmm, but I didn't think that he would beat me in.\nASTRID: Well, he just lost his partner. Plus he is new in town. He doesn't know anybody. (suggestive) He's probably a little lonely.\nOLIVIA: (rejects Astrid's suggestion) No. Not going to happen.\nASTRID: (continues the match-making) Why not? He's cute.\nOLIVIA: (quickly dismissive. rapid-fire list) Because if I went out with him, then I would start having second thoughts, like I always do, and then he would get hurt, and then my workplace would become awkward. (cell phone rings) And you know what? He's not even my type. (ringing continues)\nASTRID: (flatly honest) Do you ever think that maybe your type just doesn't exist?\nOLIVIA: (answers her phone) Dunham. (listens) I'll be right there.\n(at her boss' desk, Dunham studies photos of dead victims while being briefed on a serial murder case)\nBROYLES: Twenty-three victims we know of, all following the same M.O. He drills into the back of the skull to access the brain. The tissue was punctured and exposed to localized electrical charges. But that's not what killed them. The official cause of death: cerebral hypothermia. A chemical agent was used to lower the brain's temperature. They froze from the inside out.\nOLIVIA: (feeling out of the loop) Twenty-three murders. Why haven't I heard of them?\nBROYLES: Because these crimes weren't committed over here. (hands over a case file from Fringe Division) We've been asked to assist on this case. (pauses while she thinks) Is that gonna be a problem?\n(Broyles and Dunham step onto a large scanning device in a secure hallway)\nSCANNING DEVICE: Initiate scan. (after a few seconds) Scan complete.\n(the two agents join Olivia's counterpart in a briefing room)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Twenty-two murders, killer didn't leave a single clue. (selects a file on her electronic screen pad) Then, on the twenty-third, we found a stray hair. (taps the electronic device. shows the suspect's profile.) D.N.A. led us to John Louis McClennan. No prior arrests. Show Me is up-to-date. Once we I.D.'d him, we went to his house, ready to apprehend him, but he didn't show up. He's disappeared.\nOLIVIA: He was ahead of you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: With a two hundred and twenty I.Q., I imagine he's way ahead of us. Five years we've been looking for this guy. He was sloppy once. He's not gonna make the same mistake again.\nOLIVIA: So what do you need from us?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We need you to escort the John Louis McClennan from your side over to ours.\nOLIVIA: (hesitant) Why? To what end?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We're hoping that he can give some insight into our Mister McClennan.\nOLIVIA: Look, I understand that they have the same D.N.A. --\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (interrupting) I know all the reasons why not to do this. I've been through them all with my own Colonel Broyles. Frankly, we've got no options.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well why don't you just interview him over here?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Because we want him to see where the killer was living. If -- if he can, uh, interact with the space, study his belongings, he can glean something that we can't.\nOLIVIA: Well, you hope he can.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (protagonistic) Well, I lived in your apartment, and I picked up a lot of things about you.\nOLIVIA: (curt) Will you excuse us a moment?\n(the two agents step out of the room. Dunham starts a small rant)\nOLIVIA: Okay, I get it. The accord was necessary. But this -- this is different.\nBROYLES: Olivia, stop.\nOLIVIA: Saving people's lives is important. Of course it is. But -- but I mean, have we even thought this through? I mean, how can we both...\nBROYLES: It's really not that complicated. Chain-of-command is simple. Over here, we're in charge. Over there, they are.\nOLIVIA: (lowers her demeanor) It is only simple if there's trust. What about that tech we gave them that we took from the human shape-shifter? I mean, have we even heard back?\nBROYLES: Their Science Division is still working on it. I haven't forgotten about that. (sighs. calmer) Look. I know this is difficult for you. If there was any other way to execute this, I'd ask someone else.\nOLIVIA: Okay, how is this even gonna work? Are we prepared to start telling civilians about the parallel universe?\nBROYLES: No. No, we don't tell him anything. Professor McClennan won't have to know where he's been taken.\nOLIVIA: He's a professor? And over there he's a serial killer? (not yet convinced) And we're counting on similarities?\nBROYLES: On our side, McClennan teaches Forensic Psychology at West Connecticut College. His area of study: serial killers. (sighs) Look, I don't know if this is gonna work. But maybe it's not so far-fetched, either.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (sitting in his book laden office) Uh, I'm a bit surprised. (chuckles) You read my article. I'm -- I'm working on a follow-up, actually. I don't think that we can underestimate the role that empathy plays in the structuring of the self, or -- or the lack thereof. I've profiled before for law enforcement, but I should say that, uh, this is the first time with the FBI.\nOLIVIA: Are you willing to participate?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (adamant) Agent Dunham, I have been working towards this my entire life.\nOLIVIA: There's a reason that we've kept this out of the media. This case is highly classified.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Okay.\nOLIVIA: And one of the things that you are not able to know is where we're going. (pages her colleague with her Smartphone) Do you have any allergies to tranquilizers?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: What happened to blindfolds?\nOLIVIA: Well, it's a long journey, and I assure you, it'd be more comfortable this way.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Mm. No. No allergies.\nOLIVIA: (hears knock at door) Come in. (to McClennan) This is Agent Bergmann. He'll be administering a mild sedative.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (rolls-up his sleeve for an injection. delightfully surprised when he is handed a liquid dose to swallow) Hm. Here's to intrigue. (raises a toast. drinks the sedative)\n(in the alternate universe, at the home of serial killer John Louis McClennan in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Captain Lincoln Lee prepares his detail from Fringe Division for the arrival of Forensic Psychologist John McClennan. agents put the final touches on the theatrical deception they have planned)\nLINCOLN LEE: (on his cell phone) Okay, thanks. (to team members installing listening devices in the house) Are we wired?\nFD TECHNICIAN: Good to go.\nLINCOLN LEE: (knocks on bathroom door) Hey, Liv, it's me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, come in. (finishes fitting the blonde wig that makes her look like Olivia) What do you think?\nLINCOLN LEE: (smartly) Blonde looks good on you.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah well, lucky Frank likes the red, huh? (amused with the image in the mirror)\nLINCOLN LEE: I didn't say I didn't like the red. You look good in both. (helps her with an Olivia-style jacket)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you.\nLINCOLN LEE: They're pulling up.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay.\nFD AGENT #1: (radio chatter) Take it all the way down to the county road.\nFD AGENT #2: (radio chatter) : That sounds like a good idea. Alright, let's go. Lock it up. Thank you. Moving now.\nFD AGENT #1: (radio chatter) It's called in -- Davidson's available for transport.\nFD AGENT #2: (radio chatter) Lead vehicle, sat -- (clears throat)\nLINCOLN LEE: (a panel van arrives curbside and Fringe Division welcomes the FBI) Agent Dunham. We appreciate your help on this.\nOLIVIA: Hello, Agent Lee. (inspects Bolivia's look-alike outfit) I button my jacket. (to Lee) So where do you want me?\nLINCOLN LEE: We've got audio surveillance in that vehicle.\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nLINCOLN LEE: We'll monitor from there.\nOLIVIA: Okay, that's fine. (steps aside as the sedated Professor is gurneyed through the front door of the killer's home)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (sassy) Showtime.\n(next to a busy suburban street, day-to-day life goes on at a modest fuel service facility)\nFEMALE CUSTOMER: I'm not afraid. I'm not. You ready to do this?\nMECHANIC: Yep.\nFEMALE CUSTOMER: Gotta gas it.\nMECHANIC: Yeah, yeah. I think it's the right one. I'll check it out inside.\nFEMALE CUSTOMER: Yeah, yeah.\n(a new customer stops next to one of the pumps and is ready to fill'er-up. her elementary school daughter hops out of the minivan and is eager to pitch-in with apprenticeship duties)\nMEGAN MILLER: Can I do the windows?\nNOREEN MILLER: I would love it if you would. (upbeat reinforcement to her 'almost tall enough for the job' helper) Well done, my girl. That is beautiful work. You want a snack?\nMEGAN MILLER: I want chips.\nNOREEN MILLER: Oh, that is shocking that you want chips.\n(from a picnic bench on the far side of the property, John Louis McClennan sits, sips his hot beverage - intensely focused on the two ladies servicing their minivan)\n(Mozart's Requiem in D Minor blaring in the lab. Walter seated in front of numerous speakers. head back. eyes closed.)\nASTRID: (steps in the lab) Walter. Walter! Walter! (stops the music)\nPETER: Walter. (Walter gasps)\nASTRID: Do you have any idea how loud that was?\nWALTER: A man may soothe his soul.\nASTRID: Walter, you found that soothing?\nWALTER: Do you have any idea what it cost Mozart to create that movement?\nASTRID: Walter, stop. What's wrong with you?\nWALTER: Nothing. My nerves are a bit raw. I haven't been sleeping well.\nASTRID: I checked your meds, and the counts are way off. You've been overdoing it.\nWALTER: I've been experimenting. Again.\nASTRID: It's okay. (holds on to Walter's hand) I'm gonna help you get back on track. But if there is something else going on, you need to tell me.\nWALTER: I need to rest. That's all. (stands up) Perhaps I'll go lie down. (walks slowly. covers a reflective surface.)\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (inspecting the neatly organized shelves) He needs to feel in control. Messy spaces bother him. (chuckles) He's highly intelligent. Hm. Probably self-taught. (carefully looking at action figures displayed in the shelf) And he's... fascinated by the brain. (about the many packages) Germany. China. Uh, Thailand.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, he ordered a lot of parts online from overseas for the schematics that he designed.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Hm. Mm... Hm. (unrolls a blueprint.) What are these for?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We don't know.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (radio relay in the surveillance vehicle) He needs to divert himself from his misery, so he builds things to occupy his time.\nLINCOLN LEE: (looks at Olivia in the passenger's seat) You hate being out here, don't you?\nOLIVIA: Why do you say that?\nLINCOLN LEE: 'Cause it would drive her crazy.\nOLIVIA: I'm fine with it. (as papers rustles on the speaker)\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (opens a box) Uh, egg hatching lights. My dad used to work on a farm. We had chickens for a while. I don't know what he'd be using this for.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Does anything else stand out to you?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Hm? Mm. Uh, he's deeply unhappy. He grew up feeling deprived, and... other kids had things, and he -- he didn't. He's trying to make up for it now, but... He can't. (opens fridge) Dinner's important to him. He hunts during the day. He blends into his surroundings.\nMEGAN MILLER: I have to go to the bathroom.\nNOREEN MILLER: Okay. Come straight back. Alright?\nMEGAN MILLER: I will.\nNOREEN MILLER: And don't touch anything you don't have to. I'll just finish your job for you.\nMEGAN MILLER: Okay.\n(a man silently watches the girl enter the restroom. then studies the mother. he abandons his seat)\n(the profiling assessment moves to the workshop. several tools, gadgets and photo albums are scattered around the area. the professor points at the yellow chair)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (confused) The chair. Uh, we had a set of chairs like that in -- in the house that I grew up in. (over radio) That's crazy. It's exactly the same. I loved that chair. (nervous giggle)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Hm. Oh, my. (in awe, seeing a wall of pictures of happy faces)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What do you think? (feeling uneasy)\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: There's too many of them. They're -- they're -- they're strangers to him. Uh, he -- he -- he doesn't know them.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Why have them displayed?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Oh, because he's jealous of them. Because he... he hates that they have happy lives. That's what he looks for. He takes them when they're happy. His feelings are all that matter. He wants to feel better.\nMEGAN MILLER: (exits the restroom, smiles at the next user and hurries back to back to her now abandoned minivan. looks around and calls-out) Mom? Mom!\n(a few feet from the car, a warm tea was left in the table)\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (removes a familiar picture) How could he have this?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Do you know that man?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: He's my father.\n(shocks Bolivia. Lincoln and Olivia look at each other)\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: What is this? What -- is -- is this some kind of a joke?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (trying to calm the professor down) No, John, this is not a joke. Of course not.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (increasingly agitated) No, no, of course not. What the hell is going on here? Why do you have a picture of my father?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (over radio) Just calm down.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (over radio) And the same damn chair from my childhood?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM (over radio) You don't understand.\nOLIVIA: It's over.\nLINCOLN LEE: Don't.\nOLIVIA: He's my responsibility. (runs toward the house with Lee following)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (catches-up with the agitated professor) Professor. Professor, wait.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I'm finished here!\n(the professor stops and stares at the two Olivias. his gaze moves toward a nearby amber quarantine zone)\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Where am I? Where am I?\n(standing near the communications van curbside)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: See, I should've removed the pictures.\nLINCOLN LEE: You took a calculated risk. I thought it would work too.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Broyles didn't want me to do it in the first place, and Charlie thinks that I'm insane.\nLINCOLN LEE: Charlie's on a beach sipping Mai-Tais with the Bug Lady. I'm sorry, Missus Bug Lady.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Right.\nLINCOLN LEE: Besides, it's not over yet.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (growing frustrated) I'm gonna go in there.\nLINCOLN LEE: (grabs her by the elbow and stops her) Give her a minute.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Don't.\n(sitting in the killer's living room and looking at a family photo)\nOLIVIA: In this universe, some things are the same, and some things aren't. People... make different choices and -- and therefore end up in different places.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I mean, this is... like a nightmare.\nOLIVIA: John, anything that you can tell us about him... anything will help. Anything.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I don't just understand him. I am him. What's in him is in me.\nOLIVIA: So what do you mean?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: You're not the only one with secrets.\nOLIVIA: Go on.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (soul searching) For as long as I can remember... I knew something was wrong with me. (Bolivia walks in) My father -- he knew it too. He saw the darkness. He -- he used a... heavy hand to try and fix me. The brutality of it, I mean, it was...\n(Bolivia lingers near the entrance)\nOLIVIA: I al -- I also came from an abusive home. My -- my stepfather w --\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (about his professional calling) It's no mistake that I - I do what I do. I want to understand myself. I want to help people like me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (joins the introspection) Have you ever acted on it?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: No. But I've wanted to.\nOLIVIA: What stopped you?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Not what. Who. (pauses) She -- she helped me find just small... moments of peace. Moments... that I can hold on to.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Your mother.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: No. My mother would... her -- her name was Margery. And what my father did with cruelty she did with love. She taught me that I didn't have to live in the darkness. That when I got the urges, that I c -- I could just step out of it and into the light. (revelation) This -- this is crazy. This -- this is -- because sometimes when I, um, imagine what my life would've been like without her... this is it.\nLINCOLN LEE: walks in. to Bolivia. leaves) Can I see you?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I wish I could tell him. (the serial killer)\nOLIVIA: And tell him what?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: That it doesn't have to be this way. That -- that there's a way. That he just had no one to -- to -- to, uh, to teach him. I mean, you said so yourself. Some things happened... some way in this world, and -- and -- and some didn't, right?\nOLIVIA: That may be so. But John... He can never know that you exist. You understand that. There's no other road for him.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Right.\n(standing near the communications van. hands-over an electronic tablet with an image of the recently abducted)\nLINCOLN LEE: Her name is Noreen Miller. Thirty-two.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, so when did this happen?\nLINCOLN LEE: She disappeared from a gas station rest stop about an hour ago. The security cameras picked up an image of him just before she disappeared.\nOLIVIA: (joins the duo outside) There's another victim? (looks at the image on the tablet) Okay, John thinks he may be able to help you guys find him.\nLINCOLN LEE: Let's go get him. (walks back in the house looking for the Professor) Where is he?\nESCORT AGENT: Bathroom.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (looks at where they had been sitting and talking) It's gone.\nLINCOLN LEE: What's gone?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The photograph of his father. (barges into an empty bathroom and finds the window open)\nLINCOLN LEE: (waiting for his boss at the elevator) I take full responsibility, Sir. I'm the senior officer, and...\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: ...sir, Lincoln's just trying to protect me. This was my idea.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: ...I'm not interested in culpability right now. Do we have any leads?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We think we know where he's going.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You don't sound entirely convinced.\nOLIVIA: (jumps in to the one-sided conversation) We -- we \u2014 we think that he's trying to find the killer.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: And why would he do that?\nOLIVIA: Because, we believe, he wants to stop him.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (announces from her workstation) We're online. (joined by the investigators) Professor John McClennan is not from here. The differences between his universe and ours will take him time to comprehend, which will make it easier to track him. He does not have a Show me, which means his access to public transportation is restricted. Although given a psychological profile, there's a forty-three point two percent chance that under extraordinary circumstances, he would be willing to steal someone's identification.\nLINCOLN LEE: I'd say this is pretty extraordinary.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Initial calculations indicate that there are two hundred and nineteen potential routes he could've taken in the time he's been missing, but the possibilities branch out exponentially the longer that he's out there. Even with our facial recognition programs, going through that much data is going to take a long time.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: How long?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Thirteen hours, plus or minus.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: If you're right, Agent Dunham, then finding Professor McClennan is our best chance to save Noreen Miller. Let me know when you have something.\n(later. after the Farnsworth briefing)\nOLIVIA: (approaches) I have an idea.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (dismissive) You know, that woman processes more information in an hour than you and I will in a lifetime, so if she hasn't thought of it, it's not there.\nOLIVIA: Yes, but she didn't see the photograph of John's father, and I did. Now, John said his father worked as a farmhand, so if we can trace the farm, then we --\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, but we can't because John's father didn't own the farm, so his name wouldn't be on it.\nOLIVIA: I understand, but in the photograph, he was standing in front of a tractor with commercial plates. Pennsylvania, T-R-5-3-8-7-9. We can trace the registration.\n(the serial killer shaves the back of Noreen Millers skull, preparing it to accept the cranial plug he intends to install. sedated, Miller doesn't flinch when McClennan installs a large bit in his high-power pneumatic drill and tests it. just as he prepares to penetrate the woman's skull with his drill, Professor McClennan enters and interrupts the procedure. the serial killer is speechless when he turns to see his body double)\nLINCOLN LEE: (briefing a team of Agents as they don their assault gear. talks to overhead photos and the image of the abductee) Weir Farm. Shut down ten years ago, after the Richboro fires. It's been unoccupied ever since. Noreen Miller. Goes without saying, but I'm still gonna say it. All necessary steps should be taken to bring her home unharmed. Any questions? (looks around the room) Let's go.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (to Olivia as the assault team prepares to leave) Ride with me.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (trying to convince his counterpart to leave Noreen Miller be) It doesn't have to be like this. You don't have to hurt her. You're going for your Forty-Five Silver. You keep it in the toolbox.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: (amazed) How did you know that? How did you know that?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: That's where he kept it. My dad.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: What are you?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I was like you. And then, one night in October, I - I went to a fair. I - I was ten. And that's the night that my father found the dead things. Only I didn't know that yet. I - I was playing carnival games, and I \u2013 I - I saw him coming toward me, and then I knew that he knew. The moment I saw him, I - I knew...\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: ...that's my life. That's what happened to me. It was the ring toss that I was playing.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Yeah. Me too.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: I hid...\nPROFEESSOR MCCLENNAN: ...behind the wagon wheel.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: But he found me. Grabbed me by the collar. His fingernails cut into my neck. He dragged me home, and he beat me for three days straight.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Not me. I ran. As far, as fast, as long as I could. I woke up in a field, and this woman... was standing over me. Her name was Margery. And because of her, I -- I don't have to do what you do to stop the pain.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: You can't control it. If you're like me...\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I can control it.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: It can never stop!\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: She taught me how.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: No. This is the only way. I do this! And for awhile --\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I can stop the urges.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: It's quiet.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: No. I know the screams inside your head that won't stop. It's a horrible place to be. But I can help you. Like Margery helped me. You can step out of the darkness. Don't you want the pain to end?\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: Yes.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: I can show you how.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: Maybe you can.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: (driving through the dark, rural woods) What you said to John about your stepfather-- you were trying to open him up, huh?\nOLIVIA: Yes. It's also true.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So what happened to him?\nOLIVIA: My stepfather? (matter-of-factly) I killed him. (Bolivia not expecting that reply)\nTACTICAL AGENT 1: Get a lockdown perimeter going.\nTACTICAL AGENT 2: Got it.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: (starts making preparations in his lab to extract memories from his newest victim) Ah. Ah, ahhhhh. We are ready to begin. Tell me... About your happiest memories. Tell me about Margery.\n(Fringe Division forces gather around the primary building on the property and prepare for a forced entry and rapid assault on the serial killer, in order to recover Noreen Miller)\nTACTICAL AGENT 1: (as Lee breaks open the front door) Take the upstairs.\nTACTICAL AGENT 2: Get the hallway.\nTACTICAL AGENT 3: We're clear!\nTACTICAL AGENT 1: Back room's clear!\nTACTICAL AGENT 2: We got nothing, sir!\nTACTICAL AGENT 3: We're all clear, sir!\n(as the team secures the house, key personnel searching the main parlor realize)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Damn it.\nLINCOLN LEE: We're in the wrong place.\n(walking through an overgrown homestead with flashlights, a search helicopter above and others searching the surrounding woods, the two agents inspect the broken and decaying remnants of a rural farm)\nOLIVIA: What are you thinking?\nLINCOLN LEE: Over there. There was a structure here.\nOLIVIA: Um, it could be anything. A shed, a barn. There's another one.\nLINCOLN LEE: There was a group of structures here. (amid the rotting pilings) This is where the family lived. (opens the storm doors to the cellar that once served the family. weapons drawn, they cautiously descend)\n(in his makeshift lab, the serial killer extrudes the childhood memories of his other-universe counterpart)\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: How did Margery make you feel?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: (restrained) Safe. (fades to a dream-like state) She was so kind. So gentle. (envisions the pastoral sensibilities that she imbued in his post-adolescent life for both of them to see) (mentally communicating his thought) I never understood how someone so beautiful could love something so dark. (verbally. whispering. growing frigid) You... Don't have to do it... Anymore. (shares another vision of a motherly embrace. the killer is overwhelmed by the kindness, love and compassion the professor felt as a young man)\n(the agents enter the subsurface lab, look at the bizarre array of equipment in use)\nLINCOLN LEE: (scans a victim on the floor with his handheld device) She's sedated, but her pulse is strong.\nOLIVIA: (enters a dark side room with her pistol leveled) John, put your hands where I can see them.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: (weak. nearly despondent) I wanted what he had. What she gave him.\nOLIVIA: John, put your hands up.\nJOHN MCCLENNAN: I took her from him. I shouldn't have. (regretful) She made him... feel for them. What have I done to all of them? (disoriented) Margery? What have I done? (commits suicide by shooting himself. Bolivia and Lincoln rush into the room to back-up Olivia)\n(after returning to this universe, Olivia joins her supervisor in a local hospital to check on the psychologist they convinced to help them catch a serial killer)\nOLIVIA: How is the Professor?\nBROYLES: (looking through the observation window) There appears to be no permanent damage to his motor functions or cognitive ability. He is, however, suffering from partial memory loss.\nOLIVIA: Partial?\nBROYLES: He's unable to recall the events of the last few weeks. He has no memory of ever being involved in this case.\nOLIVIA: What about Margery?\nBROYLES: His memories of Margery were extracted. The neurologists believe the loss is permanent.\nOLIVIA: But for all we know, she's the only thing that's preventing him from --\nBROYLES: -- I know. Once he's released, we'll have to keep an eye on him.\nOLIVIA: Can I talk to him?\nBROYLES: He's been told he was injured doing profiling work for the FBI.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (enters the patient's room, approaches his bed and introduces herself) Hi. (waits) Do you remember me? (waits) Nothing at all? (waits) I'm Olivia Dunham. I'm one of the FBI agents who was working on the case.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: They tell me I saved a woman's life.\nOLIVIA: Yes. (upbeat smile and nod) And probably many more. I came to say thank you.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: Just glad I could be of help.\nOLIVIA: (steps closer) Do you remember Margery?\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: The other agent asked that too. No. But things are pretty dark right now. Did she have something to do with the investigation?\nOLIVIA: Sort of. (pats his knee and heads for the door) Feel better soon.\nPROFESSOR MCCLENNAN: You know what they say. That even when it's the darkest, we can step into the light. (flashes a small, confident, knowing smile)\nOLIVIA: (privately. walking the corridors) He knows what she taught him, but he can't remember who she is. How is that possible?\nBROYLES: At the risk of sounding sentimental... (very introspective. almost profound) I've always thought there were people who leave an indelible mark on your soul. An imprint that can never be erased.\n(preparing for bed, he quietly checks his aquarium, looses his slippers, arranges his pillows, gets under the covers and turns off the light. stressed by recent events, he is still uneasy)\nPETER: (from the ether) Walter, I'm here.\nWALTER: (startled) Who are you?\nPETER: Can you hear me? (omni-directional source) I'm right here.\nWALTER: No.\nPETER: Walter, I'm right here.\nWALTER: (lurches around to look) No, you're not.\nPETER: I'm here, Walter.\nWALTER: (looks straight-up) You -- you're just a fig -- a figment! (turns on his record player and blasts classical music to drown out the voice)\nPETER: Walter, I'm right here. I'm here, Walter. Right here. Walter, I'm here. Can you hear me? I'm right here. Walter. Help me, Walter. Please help me.\n(Walter finds a place on the floor to hide. distraught and questioning his own sanity, the former mental patient covers his ears with his hands as the ethereal voice continues to try and communicate with him)"

You didn't answer my question. I asked if you've been keeping up with the new medication I prescribed for you.\nWALTER: (softly. with a dry mouth) Yes. For the most part. With my own modifications, of course. (worried) Why?\nBRUCE SUMNER: Well, you just seem a little bit distracted.\nWALTER: Well, yes... as you ask. You've come at an extremely inopportune time. (avoiding direct eye contact) I'm in the middle of some very important work, and I'm anxious to resume.\nBRUCE SUMNER: I appreciate that, Walter. But these monthly evaluations are also important.\nWALTER: Well, yes, I know. It was a condition you imposed on my release from Saint Claire's.\nBRUCE SUMNER: I mean personally important. (caring tone) You were under my care there for... most of your seventeen years. These sessions allow me to catch up with you, see how you're doing. Now... (puts on glasses and reviews the report) I've been perusing the latest observational reports from the agents assigned to you, and they mention certain patterns of unusual behavior. (removes his glasses and returns to Walter)\nWALTER: Well, o - occasionally, I have a unique way of doing things which can be misinterpret...\nBRUCE SUMNER: (cuts to the chase) Tell me about the mirrors.\nWALTER: Mirrors?\nBRUCE SUMNER: And the television? Virtually every reflective surface in and around your lab has been covered or obscured by you.\nWALTER: Naturally, I covered them up. I - it's an experiment I'm conducting on --\nBRUCE SUMNER: So this had nothing to do with your lab being haunted.\nWALTER: Beg your pardon?\nBRUCE SUMNER: According to the report, (references his paperwork) you claimed on more than one occasion to have seen a strange man in the lab, a man no one else has seen, and that sometimes... the man speaks to you.\nWALTER: Oh... just minor hallucinations, of course, by my self-medication. That was weeks ago. I - I'm much better now.\nBRUCE SUMNER: So you haven't had any more of these hallucinations since?\nWALTER: (sees the same hallucination in the reflective surface of Sumner's clipboard. lying) No.\nBRUCE SUMNER: (leans forward for emphasis) Walter, it is important that you be completely honest with me so that I can make an assessment of your state of mind and I can make recommendations for your continued care... whatever that may be.\n(a slight boy runs frantically from two bullies down a forested foot path)\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: (yelling as he follows) You're dead, Sneddon. You hear me?\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: (closing-in from behind) You better run, Rat! We're gonna beat your ass!\n(growing tired and breathless, Sneddon slips through an open door into a dark subsurface tunnel hoping to elude his tormentors)\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: Wait up a minute, man.\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: You run like a little girl. Keep up.\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: We got him now. He went in there.\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: Oh, he's like so dead.\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: (entering the dark, isolated tunnel) There he is.\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: Picked a bad place to hide, dumb ass.\nAARON SNEDDON: Just leave me alone, guys.\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: Or what? I know it was you, you little freak. You got me busted for the stash in my locker.\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: Come on, Matt, kick his ass.\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: (throws his bag to his friend. grabs Sneddon's shirt and prepares to punch him) You had this coming...\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: (startled) Uh... something touched my leg!\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: It's probably just a bug or something. Tough it out.\nBRIAN O'TOOLE: Dude, what is this? (growing more terrified) What the hell is this?\nMATTHEW MITNOVITZ: Huh?\n(both bullies groan as whatever was on the ground starts to envelop them, covering their arms and faces as they are frozen where they stand. Sneedon flees to safety)\n(Olivia develops a sketch of the man in her dreams and runs facial recognition software)\nAGENT LEE: (just arriving) Hey. (approaches Olivia) Working a case?\nOLIVIA: (hits a few keys to hide her work) Something like that. Mm-hmm.\nAGENT LEE: Hmm. I got, uh, word you wanted to see me? We get any news on the shape-shifter attack?\nOLIVIA: Uh, no. I just wanted to check in with you, see how you're handling everything. I know you've been going through the case files, getting up to speed. I understand that it can be kind of overwhelming. It's hard when what you knew or what you thought you knew about the world... no longer holds. And I just wanted you to know that I'm here.\nAGENT LEE: (wary) You're... here?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. To talk to, you know? I mean, just if things are getting a little too much or if you're freaked out...\nAGENT LEE: I'm... not freaked out.\nOLIVIA: Oh. Good. (nodding) Okay. Well, you just let me know.\nAGENT LEE: If I freak out, (awkward) I -- yeah, you... you'll be the first to know.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\n(police, crime scene and federal personnel crowd the area where young Aaron Sneddon previously evaded punishment at the hands of older boys)\nBROYLES: We've got two bodies. (after the body bag is opened) Twelve-year-old boys.\nAGENT LEE: How many months since they've been missing?\nBROYLES: Not months. Hours. Somewhere between ten and fifteen, according to the reports their families made when they didn't come home last night.\nTECHNICIAN: Agent Broyles? Agent Farnsworth is ready for you.\nBROYLES: (joins Astrid at the entrance to the subsurface room) Has Doctor Bishop come up with any theories yet on cause of death or the bodies' advanced state of decomposition?\nASTRID: (on her videophone) Walter, Agent Broyles wants to know if--\nWALTER: (foul mood) Yes, yes, I heard him. (watching Broyles on his video feed) Will you tell Agent Broyles that as there appears to be no unusual environmental factors to explain the rapid deterioration, that it is absurd for me to make any determination without first examining the remainders!\nASTRID: (to Broyles) Okay, Walter said he--\nWALTER: (hyper-cranky) Tell him, for all I know, it could be viral or a mutation of some flesh-eating bacteria.\nASTRID: (to Broyles) He thinks that--\nWALTER: (continues to interrupt) Some kind of alien parasite or... Bigfoot. Bigfoot! That's it. (makes excuses gesture to Broyles. patiently waiting for Walter's rational response.) Astrid, perhaps you can look around for massive fecal droppings, huh?\nASTRID: (covers her earpiece) He doesn't have any theories, sir.\nAGENT LEE: (flashes light on the floor where the bullies died) I think I got something. There's a third set of sneaker treads leading in... and then out. Size seven, eight, maybe.\nBROYLES: Then we have a potential witness.\nOLIVIA: Or another victim. Even if there was another boy that got away, he could still be infected by whatever killed the other two.\nBROYLES: Point taken. We need to find him fast.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. If he's alive.\nASTRID: Oh! (covers her mouth and nose)\nWALTER: (after opening a body bag) Remarkably pungent stench.\nASTRID: (disgusted. steps away) I'm gonna... get some scented candles.\nWALTER: (trying to be civil) Agent Broyles. It was good of you to accompany Astrid, although unnecessary.\nBROYLES: Agents Dunham and Lee are tracking down the identity of the boy who fled the scene. I thought I'd take the opportunity to check in on you.\nWALTER: Oh... how nice. May I ask why?\nBROYLES: You had your evaluation with Doctor Sumner last night. He called me afterwards to voice some concerns.\nWALTER: Concerns?\nBROYLES: He thought you seemed unusually agitated by something you were reluctant to confide.\nWALTER: I... (stammers) I can't imagine what gave him that impress--\nPETER: (faintly) Walter?\nWALTER: Where's the second body?\nBROYLES: On its way to the morgue. I assumed one was sufficient for your examination.\nWALTER: (tongue-tied) Not... not sufficient at all. I - it's quite the opposite. I... I... I need both bodies.\nPETER: (louder) Walter.\nWALTER: (to the voice) What?\nBROYLES: (having not heard the voice) What?\nWALTER: (to Broyles) Did you say something?\nBROYLES: (seeing what Sumner saw) I asked why you need both bodies.\nWALTER: Because -- (flinches at the voice)\nPETER: (echoing) Walter, listen to me. Walter, do you see me?\nWALTER: (eyes closed. focusing. talking over the top of the voice) Only by... comparison...\nPETER: (clearer) Walter, I can hear you.\nWALTER: Will I be able to determine...\nPETER: Where are you?\nWALTER: If there are patterns to the decomposition of the tissue...\nPETER: Listen...\nWALTER: (tremendously agitated, he covers his ears) Or... or the putrefaction of the internal organs, it may well be that... that the victims perished at different intervals.\nPETER: I'm scared. ... has to help me... Do you see me? I'm right here.\nAGENT BROYLES: Doctor Bishop.\nPETER: Walter, I'm scared.\nWALTER: And one of them may be a carrier!\nPETER: I want to come home.\nWALTER: (hunched over and cowering) I am not losing my mind! (after the voice fades. much calmer) I would appreciate you arranging to have the second remains sent here as soon as possible. Excuse me. (walks away).\nAGENT BROYLES: (answers cell phone) Broyles.\nOLIVIA: (voiceover) It's Olivia. We have a lead on the third boy. This morning another student told the principal that the two victims had been talking about plans to beat a kid up. (Sneddon sits alone in the school cafeteria drawing images in his notebook. looks up to see Lee and Dunham approaching)\n(Aaron sits and draws while Olivia talks privately with the boss and shares what she has learned so far)\nOLIVIA: His name is Aaron Sneddon. He's ten years old. He said it was pretty dark and he didn't see much after the boys chased him into the tunnel.\nBROYLES: Why didn't he tell anyone what happened? His parents?\nOLIVIA: Well, he has no father, and his mother is out of the country. Aaron said that she's away a lot for work.\nBROYLES: But the boy's mother wouldn't leave him home by himself.\nOLIVIA: No, she has him stay with a neighbor in their apartment complex. His principal said that he's a quiet boy, that she doesn't know him to have many friends. So has Walter gotten anywhere yet?\nAGENT BROYLES: Beyond his random theories of vampires and succubae, no. He says he needs to examine the other body. I'd like you and Agent Lee to retrieve it from the morgue. I'll let Doctor Bishop know the boy is here. (approaches Walter examining the remains of the victim)\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) Okay. (approaches and sits next to the young quiet artist) You like to draw? (waits for reply) Me too. (takes her time) Aaron, we're going to have to get you checked out to make sure that you're okay. Our friend, Doctor Bishop, is going to examine you.\nAARON SNEDDON: (timidly) I don't like doctors. They scare me.\nOLIVIA: Oh, you'll like Walter. There's nothing scary about him.\nWALTER: (raises everyone's eyebrows when he approaches in autopsy attire, face shield, covered in blood) Alright, young man. Let's get started. Take off your shirt and hop on the table.\nAARON SNEDDON: (sitting on exam table. politely) Please, I don't want a shot.\nWALTER: Well, technically a shot is depositing a substance into the bloodstream. This is more a withdrawal. Just this one time. I promise. (receives tentative nod of approval, draws blood and bandages the arm) There. That wasn't so bad. Good boy. You can put your shirt on now. I'll be right back. (puts the sample in the centrifuge while Aaron starts a curse inspection of the lab and Walter's cool toys)\nWALTER: (very upset) Please, don't touch that! (grabs a small action figure from Aaron) Give me... (composing himself. apologetic) It's alright. It's alright. I.. I shouldn't have shouted. It... it belonged to my son.\nAARON SNEDDON: You have a son?\nWALTER: I did. (somber) He died.\nASTRID: Walter. You need to come and take a look at this.\nWALTER: What is it? (joins her over the one corpse they received)\nASTRID: It happened when I was moving a candle. (candle near the corpse and the flame blows out)\nWALTER: That's curious.\nASTRID: Yeah. Look at the lambda sensor. (scans the body)\nWALTER: The corpse is pulling high levels of oxygen out of the air. (looks closely at the torso) Astrid... I don't remember there being this much mold on the ribcage before. (through a magnifying glass the mold begins to swell) Dear God. The incubation case. Quickly! Grab the other end. We have to contain it.\nASTRID: Walter. (rushes to prepare the sealable chamber)\nWALTER: No time to explain. Hurry! (after the corpse is locked into the chamber, it immediately explodes into a fine, chalky cloud)\nWALTER: (studies the cloud-filled chamber) Spores. I... I had assumed that the mold was just a symptom of the rapid decomposition.\nASTRID: Walter, I am not following.\nWALTER: The cause, Astrid... I'm starting to believe that it was an aggressive form of fungi that killed the boys.\nASTRID: (alarmed) Olivia and Lincoln. They went to the morgue to get the other body.\nOLIVIA: (walking with Lee. answers cell phone) Astrid?\nASTRID: (excited) Are you at the morgue?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, we're just heading to the elevator now--\nASTRID: (critically directive) Listen, you have got to evacuate the room. Get the body from the tunnel locked down.\nOLIVIA: What?\nASTRID: It's going to explode and release spores! (quickly calls the morgue as Dunham and Lee rush to start the lockdown)\nBETH: (too busy to answer the ringing wall phone) You gonna get that?\nTECHNICIAN #2: (sitting across from the corpse. mouth full of food) I'm eating my lunch.\nASTRID: (bouncing nervously waiting for a reply) Come on, come on, come on, come on.\n(Olivia and Lee make poor time in the crowded halls. almost finished with lunch, the technician notices movement in the corpse and approaches it)\nTECHNICIAN #2: Hey, Beth, come here. Take a look at this. (just as Beth finally picks-up Astrid's warning call)\nOLIVIA: (nearly to the morgue access door, the safety glass whites-out in a cloud of small airborne spores) Oh gawd. (inside the morgue, the two technicians cough virulently. impulsively, Lee starts to open the access door to help)\nAGENT LEE: (after Olivia grabs his hand to stop him) What are you doing? We gotta get them out of there.\nOLIVIA: We can't open that door. We need to get a team in here and lock down the area.\nAGENT LEE: (nearly frantic) What about them? We can't just leave 'em to die.\nOLIVIA: (ill-fatedly) They're already dead.\n(once they are joined by a Fringe response team, and have donned bio-hazard suits, the investigators need to batter the morgue door open to get past the aggressive fungi that has already covered the room in tendrils and branching. the technicians are dead and already starting to decompose)\nBROYLES: (over the headset is his protective helmet) Doctor Bishop. Can you tell us what we're dealing with here?\nWALTER: (busy checking Petri Dish with Astrid, in his lab) Clearly not the garden variety of Cordyceps fungi. A genetic mutation with a capacity of hyper-accelerated growth and nutrition absorption, which explains the rapid decomposition of the bodies.\nOLIVIA: (over her headset) Walter, what's Cordyceps fungi?\nWALTER: A species capable of releasing neurotoxins so as to paralyze a host, usually an insect, so that the fungi can feed and lay its spores. (pokes his sample with a long probe)\nBROYLES: So why aren't they attacking us?\nWALTER: These are not a pack of wolves, Agent Broyles. Size not withstanding, they are still a lower life form with rudimentary instincts probably based on tactile response. As long as none of you touch them, they won't even know you're there.\nAGENT LEE: (to the team about the aggressive fungal tendrils) A couple of these bad boys are making their way down the sink.\nWALTER: Most likely seeking more water and nutrients, which shows a strong impulse to expand their reach as far as possible. I mean, really, this is a most extraordinary species, don't you think?\nBROYLES: Admiration aside, Doctor Bishop, how do you recommend killing these things?\nWALTER: As with a great many molds and fungi, a strong dose of U.V. light or intense heat should effectively eradicate them.\n(Astrid grabs a U.V. wand, holds it to their sample and watches it quickly decay)\nBROYLES: Understood. (to one of his support agents nearby) Agent Mace, this is Broyles. We're going to need high-intensity U.V. lamps in here, as many as you can find.\nAGENT MACE: Yes, sir. Copy that.\nAGENT BROYLES: I'll oversee things here. I want you and Agent Lee to assemble a small team and have them meet you at the tunnel.\nOLIVIA: Based on the boy's remains, the fungus colony at the tunnel is probably much bigger than what we have here. I'm not convinced that U.V. is the most efficient way to destroy it.\nAGENT BROYLES: You have something else in mind?\nOLIVIA: I'm thinking flamethrowers.\n(Sneddon puts on his coat and follows Walter through the lab to the exit)\nWALTER: Fortunately, your tests show no sign of fungal infection. The good news is that you're now free to return home. Agent Farnsworth will drop you there. (notes the young man's body language) Unless it's not good news.\nAARON SNEDDON: (dejected) Nobody's there.\nWALTER: Oh, yes. I understand you're staying with a friend.\nAARON SNEDDON: A neighbor, but she never talks to me.\nWALTER: Perhaps there's someone else with whom you can stay.\nAARON SNEDDON: (sad-sack) No.\nWALTER: I see. Well, I certainly know what it feels like to have nowhere to go. No family. (simply put) This is the only home I know.\nAARON SNEDDON: You live here?\nWALTER: Yeah. (upbeat nod yes) It's not much, I admit, but... it's certainly better than the mental institution where I lived before this. (As Aaron starts to leave) Would you like to stay here with me for a little while longer? I can't promise that I'll have any time for entertaining you, understand. I'm a very busy man.\n(but not too busy to make foil hats, blend strawberry milkshakes and listen to some music)\nWALTER: (sitting and sipping through a straw) Mmm, mmm, mmm! Sublime.\nAARON SNEDDON: Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: Walter. I said you could call me Walter.\nAARON SNEDDON: How did your son die?\nWALTER: (caught off-guard by the query) Peter was very sick. I tried for a long time to find a cure... but I found it too late, and he died. Then I discovered an alternate universe where another version of my son was dying from the same malady. So I crossed over to the other side with the intention of bringing him back to cure him. But the frozen lake where I created a portal between universes was unsound, and when we crossed back, the ice broke. And Peter... the other version of him... drowned. And I lost him all over again.\nAARON SNEDDON: (with a child's candor) And... you don't think you belong in a mental institution?\n(Walter absorbs the large truth, then ignores the question by choosing to sip his shake)\nOLIVIA: (entering the underground chamber as technicians prepare to eradicate the aggressive mold) How soon 'til the flood lights are up?\nTECHNICIAN: Almost there, ma'am.\nAGENT LEE: (inspects all small corner with his flashlight) Here's our perp. Doesn't look like much in here. No wonder we overlooked it. (finds chalk tracings paralleling the mold on the walls)\nOLIVIA: (inspects higher on the wall) Well, once we've got lights, we can make sure we've taken out the entire colony.\nAGENT: (background chatter) Watch your step. There could be something there.\nTECHNICIAN: Ready for you, Agent Dunham.\n(flood lights switch on and the team studies the colony. back in the lab, Aaron groans in discomfort)\nWALTER: (milkshake finished) I don't know about you, but I'm ready for another. Aaron, what's wrong?\nAARON SNEDDON: It's... bright.\nWALTER: What? (looks around the lab for a bright light source)\nAARON SNEDDON: (covers his eyes) It's too bright.\n(in the tunnel, Lee peeks through a large crack in the wall)\nOLIVIA: What do you see?\nAGENT LEE: I need the handheld flood over here.\n(fungi slithers up the tripod)\nAGENT LEE: (looks deeper into the wall with the small floodlight) There's more of it back here. A lot more.\nAARON SNEDDON: What is that?\nWALTER: (trying to calm his new friend) Let me take a look--\nAARON SNEDDON: (reacts violently) No! Get away! What is that?\nAGENT LEE: Some of it's growing down through some grating. Do we know what's under here? (as the climbing fungi shatters the tripod-mounted lights)\nOLIVIA: Burn it. Burn it all.\nWALTER: (calls for assistance with the collapsed child) Astrid! Help me! (as Sneddon struggles with his senses) Aaron, you need to talk to me. You need to tell me what's wrong.\nASTRID: Walter, he has a high-grade fever. How'd this happen?\nWALTER: I don't know. He was complaining about something being too bright, and then he got scared, and then he just started burning.... (realizing Sneddon's condition may be linked somehow to the eradication efforts. dashes to make a phone call)\nOLIVIA: (answers her cell phone while a flame-thrower is being used to burn the colony) Walter?\nWALTER: Stop what you're doing.\nOLIVIA: (over the din) Say it again.\nWALTER: (vehement) I said stop it! You're killing the boy.\nWALTER: (to Aaron) Just a few more minutes. I don't want to turn you into a popsicle. (to Astrid after she dumps ice into the tub that Aaron is soaking in) Oh, Astrid--\nASTRID: (picks-up on the popsicle hint) I'll get you one later, Walter.\nWALTER: Oh. Grape, please. And one for my friend here. (to Aaron) You just rest there. (answers the phone while Astrid holds Aaron's head above water) Olivia. We've managed to bring his temperature down a couple of degrees, but it remains dangerously high.\nOLIVIA: (from Hyde Park) And you're positive that Aaron was affected by the fungus in the tunnel?\nWALTER: His collapse and fever coincided precisely as you were, uh, burning the colony. I am certain there was a connection.\nOLIVIA: Okay, what about the fungus at the morgue? Broyles and his team destroyed that. Why wasn't Aaron affected then?\nWALTER: Well, that I cannot explain as of yet.\nAGENT LEE: (listening over his headset. making sense of the incident) So the boy is feeling whatever this thing inside the tunnel is feeling.\nWALTER: Precisely.\nOLIVIA: Okay, whatever it is, it's dangerous, and we need to destroy it. So how do we break the connection between it and the boy?\nWALTER: I'm not sure, but perhaps the best way to determine that is to learn how the connection was formed in the first place.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, I think I may have an idea about that.\nWALTER: (approaches the dry and resting empath) Aaron, let's have a talk.\nAARON SNEDDON: About what?\nWALTER: (sits. as Astrid watches) About why you lied to us. (holds-up one of the sketches) Your drawings, Aaron. Agent Dunham found them covering the wall inside the tunnel. You never mentioned you'd been there before yesterday. Based on the size of your artwork, I'd say you go there a lot.\nAARON SNEDDON: (somewhat exhausted) It, um... it's hard to explain. I would go there sometimes. To get away. And after a while, I would... start to feel better, like I wasn't alone, that there was something there that was sad whenever I was sad. Or... I know it sounds stupid.\nWALTER: Perhaps not. You're saying you thought there was something there that felt, as you felt.\nAARON SNEDDON: I mean, I guess I thought I was just imagining it. Maybe I was crazy. But it was like it understood me, like it wanted to protect...\nWALTER: ...Protect you. Aaron, the boys who were chasing you... you intentionally led them there, didn't you? It told you to bring them back to the tunnel.\nAARON SNEDDON: (remorsefully) I didn't know what was gonna happen, I swear. I didn't know what it was! (sobs)\nWALTER: It's alright, son. Shh... I believe you did nothing wrong.\nASTRID: (as he leaves Aaron to rest) Walter... what was that all about? I don't understand.\nWALTER: I think I'm beginning to. I need Agent Dunham.\nWALTER: (explains to the two agents) My initial hypothesis was entirely wrong. These are not colonies of fungi. I now believe that-- that this is a single organism, one with rapidly evolving communication skills, enabling it to form a psychic bond with the boy. You see these? (explains using the isolation chamber where the first victim exploded) I believe that each of these fungal masses is the equivalent to a neuron, a brain cell, and these tendrils are linking them together, essentially dendrites and synapses. The organism is a vast neural network.\nAGENT LEE: Wait, you're telling me that this whole thing, all of it, is one big giant brain?\nWALTER: That's exactly what I'm saying. Agent Lee, Gus is a growing, evolving mind.\nOLIVIA: Gus?\nWALTER: Well, I thought that since it's a single living entity that perhaps we should name it for the sake of clarity.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so the reason that Aaron wasn't affected when we destroyed the fungi in the morgue--\nWALTER: Was because the colony growing there was unable to connect to the network, and until it could, it was a mindless appendage.\nAGENT LEE: That's why it was heading down the drain -- to try and connect with Gus.\nWALTER: Yeah. What you need to understand is that Gus can only make more of itself. (excited at the prospect) And as it grows, it becomes more intelligent, more self-aware, and ever more conscious of how alone in the world it is. And my contention is that Gus forged a link with Aaron over this shared sense of isolation. Until I can find a way to break the link with the boy, any assault on the organism will hurt him. (adamant) Or worse.\nOLIVIA: (answers her phone. to Walter) It's Broyles. (to Broyles) Sir, we have new information about the fungus.\nBROYLES: So have I. (from the crime scene) There's been another attack-- a homeless man camped out in an alley in Roxbury Crossing. Looks like the fungus came up through some grating.\nOLIVIA: Roxbury? That's six miles from the tunnel.\nBROYLES: I know. After Agent Lee's report on the growths in the tunnel, I found that the Boston sewer line runs directly underneath that area. We have a major infestation on our hands. We need to eradicate this thing, and we need to do it now.\nWALTER: (on speakerphone) Agent Broyles, uh, this is Walter Bishop. I -- I don't think you -- you -- you understand that I haven't yet discovered a way to break the link between the organism and the boy. I -- I need more time.\nBROYLES: I do understand, doctor. Believe me. But the longer we wait, the more likely other innocent people will be killed.\nWALTER: It's just that you are not hearing me.\nBROYLES: I suggest you keep trying with whatever time--\nWALTER: (slams the table in anger) He'll die! Do you hear me? You're going to kill Peter!\nOLIVIA: Aaron. Walter, you mean Aaron.\nWALTER: What did I say?\nBROYLES: You've got two hours, Doctor Bishop. After that, or if there are any more attacks, I can't make any promises.\nWALTER: Astrid, we need to reconfigure the neurostimulator for magnetic resonance! We need to chart Aaron's brain activity.\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham, you and Agent Lee be ready to move out.\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir.\nBROYLES: Flamethrowers aren't going to be enough. We're gonna need some help.\nBROYLES: (walking with his agents to tunnel entrance) I've got recon teams throughout the city, spread out over an eight-mile radius. So far we've determined the fungus has encroached on at least a dozen populated buildings, all of which have been evacuated.\nOLIVIA: But no other bodies have been found.\nBROYLES: Thankfully, no. (checks watch) It's been well over an hour. How's Doctor Bishop doing with the boy?\nOLIVIA: We haven't gotten any word yet.\nAGENT LEE: Agent Broyles, if you don't mind my asking, what exactly is our plan to kill Gus? (draws an odd look from Broyles)\nOLIVIA: (explaining to Broyles) That's what Walter's calling the organism.\nBROYLES: (as a white panel van rolls up the trail behind them) That's our plan, Agent Lee, compliments of Nina Sharp and Massive Dynamic. You two, along with one of their techs, will be administering a potent toxin to the fungus. (watches as a metal case is carried from the van)\nAGENT #2: (interrupts with call) Agent Broyles. Recon Six is on the line.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna check in with Walter.\nASTRID: (in the lab) Walter. It's Olivia. (hands him phone)\nWALTER: (approaches active monitor with phone) Olivia, we've managed to isolate Gus' brain wave. The link appears to be centered somewhere inside of Aaron's pre-frontal lobe.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so you know how to disconnect it?\nWALTER: Oh, no. No, I haven't quite worked that out yet.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Walter, we're running out of time.\nWALTER: I realize that. My attempts to shut down that part of his brain haven't worked! There's only one other possible option. Surgically remove the infected part.\nOLIVIA: What are you saying? You're thinking of lobotomizing him?\nWALTER: I don't know what else to do in the time I have left, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you can't!\nWALTER: I have to save his life. Whatever it takes.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Walter, listen to me. Now, you're gonna find another way, and I'm gonna talk to Broyles, explain the situation to him, and see if I can buy us some time. Stand by. (to Broyles) Sir.\nBROYLES: I just got word from one of our teams. The fungus has reached a subway platform in Midtown. We can't contain this thing. We have to move on it now.\nOLIVIA: You gave Walter two hours. There's still time.\nBROYLES: I'm sorry, but you know as well as I do we can't sacrifice countless other lives to save one boy.\nOLIVIA: (takes a deep sigh. on phone) Walter...\nASTRID: (to her colleague after he gets the disturbing 'non-option' from Olivia) What?\nWALTER: (still shocked with the message from Olivia) No time to talk. I have to think. (walks to his office and shuts the door)\nAGENT LEE: (wearing low-light imaging goggles. enters the side chamber that houses the majority of the entity) So what are we looking for?\nTECHNICIAN: Somewhere the toxin will be best distributed. Some sort of central mass. (points at a bulbous protrusion) There.\nOLIVIA: (over her tactical radio) Agent Broyles, we've located the injection point. The tech is preparing the toxin.\nBROYLES: (radios back) Copy that. Keep me apprised.\nTECHNICIAN: (prepares a large injector. looks to Olivia for the go-ahead) I was told it was on your order.\nAGENT LEE: Olivia...\nOLIVIA: (hesitant. worried about the outcome with Walter's patient) Okay.\nAARON SNEDDON: (after the fungal mass is injected. bolts forward. eyes wide open) No! (as a large tendril grabs the technician and immobilizes him)\nASTRID: (enters Walter's office) Walter, his blood pressure is falling, and he has lost consciousness. Do something!\nWALTER: (resolved to failure) I've run through every conceivable scenario I can think of. That creature has a hold on his brain, and I have no ide... wait. Wait!\nBROYLES: (over the radio) What's happening in there?\nOLIVIA: The toxin's been administered, but the technician is dead.\nBROYLES: I want you and Agent Lee to fall back to Position One now!\nOLIVIA: Yes, sir.\nAGENT LEE: (in distress) Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Lincoln, what?\nAGENT LEE: (after a tendril paralyzes his legs) I can't move.\nOLIVIA: What?\nWALTER: (standing over the examining table that holds Aaron) The source of Aaron's physical distress isn't isolated in the pre-frontal lobe, as I thought. It's also here.\nASTRID: What is that?\nWALTER: (checking his monitor) It's the Limbic System. Limbic! The emotional center of the brain. Emotion... Yes. Astrid, get me the epinephrine.\nOLIVIA: (still in the chamber) The fungus has a hold on Agent Lee. He requires immediate medical help.\nBROYLES: (over the radio) We're assembling a team now. Does the fungicide appear to be working?\nOLIVIA: Negative. The organism's still alive. I don't know why, but it's not working.\nWALTER: The link is emotional. Gus doesn't have a hold on him. He has a hold on it. (to Aaron) I'm sorry, son. (injects epinephrine into his neck) Aaron! Aaron! Listen to me! Aaron! Aaron! (holding to his neck and jostling) Good boy, good boy. I know you're scared, but you need to let go of the organism.\nAARON SNEDDON: (groggily) No... It's my friend. (saddened) No. I'll be alone.\nWALTER: I know you've come to believe that it's your friend, but it's not real. It's something that's invaded your mind. It's hurting you.\nAARON SNEDDON: Nobody cares. It doesn't matter.\nASTRID: (studying the monitor) Walter, his blood pressure is still falling. His organs are shutting down.\nWALTER: (earnest) You matter to me. I care, and I... And I don't want to lose you. I can't lose you. (somber) Not again. Aaron... I know how hard it is to make connections. I know what it is to be lonely. It takes courage to be the one to take someone else's hand, to trust that they won't leave you. (upbeat) I won't leave you, Aaron. And I'm begging you not to leave me. Please. Let it go. Let it go. Please. Let it go, son.\nASTRID: Walter... I think it's working. He's stabilizing.\nOLIVIA: (as Lee is nearly engulfed. watches as the walls of the chamber start to creak. on the radio) This is Dunham. Uh, something's happening.\nASTRID: Their brain waves have separated. Uh...It's gone. (amazed)\nOLIVIA: It's working! The organism's dying. (dragging Lee clear of his bonds) Okay... we need a medical team down here now! Lincoln, can you hear me? It's okay. It's okay. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.\nAGENT LEE: (breathing heavily) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nAGENT LEE: (exasperated. light-hearted jab) You look a little freaked out. You wanna talk about it?\nWALTER: (after Astrid rolls Aaron out in a wheelchair) Here. You take him. (offering-up the action figure he previously grabbed in anger)\nAARON SNEDDON: No, he's yours.\nWALTER: He'd be better off with you. Toys are meant to be played with. Yeah, I've seen the movie with the talking toys. Oddly disturbing.\nASTRID: (after Aaron accepts the offering) Okay, Aaron, we gotta get you to the hospital, or they're gonna give your room away to somebody who's really sick.\nAARON SNEDDON: (to Walter) Aren't you coming too?\nWALTER: Well, I very much wish I could... (sees another haunting image in the fire extinguisher glass) But I have things I need to do. We'll see each other again soon, I promise.\n(alone now, Walter takes a book from the shelf and prepares medical instruments at his desk for a little work on himself)\nOLIVIA: (returns to the lab) Walter? Astrid told me the good news about Aaron. I knew you'd figure... Walter? Walter? (checks Walter's office and finds the doctor has initiated a self-lobotomy)\nWALTER: (about the metal probe lodged between his left eye and the bridge of his nose) It's alright. The area is completely numb. I -- I know exactly what I'm doing. Just let me do this.\nOLIVIA: (calmly) Just gonna put the hammer down. (covers Walter's eye with a white cloth. removes the medical instrument.) Walter... What the hell were you thinking? (calmly administers first-aid)\nWALTER: (sullen) I don't want to be recommitted. I can't go back there. Please don't send me back.\nOLIVIA: What are you talking about?\nWALTER: I'm going insane. I've been having hallucinations. No matter what I do, they won't stop.\nOLIVIA: What kind of hallucinations, Walter?\nWALTER: For weeks now. I was afraid to tell anyone.\nOLIVIA: What are you seeing?\nWALTER: It doesn't matter. (overwhelmed)\nOLIVIA: Just tell me.\nWALTER: A person. A young man. His voice is in my head, saying peculiar things.\nOLIVIA: (reveals the sketch she has been working on) Does he look like this?\nWALTER: Where did you get this?\nOLIVIA: I drew it from memory. I've been seeing him in my dreams for the past three weeks.\nWALTER: And all this time... I thought I was losing my mind, that he was a figment of my psychosis. (sniffles) I'm perfectly sane!\nOLIVIA: Here.\nWALTER: Who is he?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I've been running facial recognition through inter-agency databases, including Interpol, but nothing's shown up.\nWALTER: (motivated) A shared vision like this... He must be real! And if he's real... We have to find him."

Olivia wakes and is startled by the entity. she grabs her pistol and rolls out of bed to defend herself. the entity dissipates as it heads away from her. her alarm sounds as scheduled - again - and she sees that all of the metallic objects have been gathered at one spot on the floor. time to get to the lab)\nASTRID: Hi, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Hey. Did I just step on a peanut?\nASTRID: You're lucky that I convinced him not to use shrimp.\nWALTER: Olivia, how nice of you to visit.\nOLIVIA: Well, technically, I'm not really visiting, because I - I work here.\nWALTER: Oh, of course.\nASTRID: Hey, Walter, why don't you show Olivia what you're doing?\nWALTER: Oh, I want to capture the apparition that's been haunting us on film. I have the power of twenty-eight cameras going here.\nOLIVIA: Walter, if you think that it's possible to capture him on film, why didn't you just use a single video camera?\nWALTER: I believe the apparition may be out of phase with our reality. And for that reason, he is not visible from all directions. Instead, he's visible only from one specific angle, which is why I can see him and no one else can. So. Multiple cameras taking pictures from multiple angles. When he shows up again, I'll have maximized the odds of capturing his image, an idea I got from the fight sequences in The Matrix.\nASTRID: He watched it last night to try and take his mind off his fear.\nWALTER: Now I welcome his visitation. Any more dreams? Did he visit again?\nOLIVIA: No. But something else did. When I woke up this morning, there was some kind of energy hovering above my bed. I know it sounds crazy, but it was making some kind of droning noise, and it seemed to be... it was powerful.\nWALTER: What did it do?\nOLIVIA: There were all these metal objects gathered in a pile on the floor, like it was collecting.\nWALTER: Ohh...\nOLIVIA: It touched me.\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nOLIVIA: Walter, do you think that I'm causing this... like when I was a child and I set fire to the room?\nWALTER: Let's get a scraping for DNA. There's no time to waste. Maybe we can deduce exactly what form of energy is responsible for this. (reads evaluation\/recommendation letter from Saint Claire's)\nASTRID: That should do it.\nOLIVIA: Here you go, Walter.\nWALTER: Thank you. I'm going to need an atmospheric sample from your apartment as soon as possible.\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nWALTER: (watching on videophone from the lab) Get closer to the metal objects. Take a reading there now.\nASTRID: Oh. It's higher. Two whole rads at this proximity.\nWALTER: Did you happen to leave a window open?\nASTRID: Uh, yeah. The bedroom window was open.\nWALTER: Agent Dunham, go to another room. The bathroom, say. Find anything metal so they can test whether those metal objects have become magnetized. (static) What was that?\nASTRID: What's what?\nWALTER: I'm getting some kind of feedback.\nOLIVIA: Astrid!\nASTRID: What's wrong?\nWALTER: What's happening? (watches remote feed of Olivia confronting the entity in the bathroom)\nASTRID: Olivia!\nWALTER: What's going on in there?\nASTRID: (calmly from the bedroom) Walter, what are you talking about?\nOLIVIA: (time aligns with the previous encounter in the bathroom) Astrid!\nASTRID: (hurries to help) What's wrong? (after the door slams in her face) Olivia! What's happening?\n(metal objects fly out of storage places and over Olivia toward the entity. the apparition dissolves and the door is released)\nASTRID: (stands near Walter as he reviews the video footage from the encounter in the apartment bathroom) So you're saying that your equipment recorded the event before it occurred? How is that even possible?\nWALTER: Whatever it is, it seemed somehow to affect time.\nOLIVIA: (as he freezes the footage and studies the image) What are you thinking, Walter?\nWALTER: I'm not sure it caused a time effect before.\nASTRID: Before? I thought you said you'd never seen anything like this?\nWALTER: Exactly like this, no, but something similar. Twenty-five years ago, when Belly and I did the Cortexiphan trials, there was a boy who displayed the beginnings of an ability for astral projection.\nOLIVIA: Astral projection?\nWALTER: The ability to travel outside the physical body. And the matter-to-energy transformation had similar results. That would explain the radiation levels in Olivia's apartment. But the ability came with a harmful side effect. Every time he astral projected, he would create a distortion in the magnetic field and attract metal objects to him.\nOLIVIA: Even if you're right, what does that have to do with me? I mean, like you said, it was twenty-five years ago.\nWALTER: Belly always theorized that the Cortexiphan children would share a psychic link, a deep emotional bond because of their shared experience. Maybe this person is trying to reach out to you, and the harmful side effects are unintentional.\nOLIVIA: (in disbelief) But why me, and why now?\nWALTER: I can't answer that. But I can say that... some of the children didn't handle the treatments as well as you did. Some had adverse reactions... emotionally. (reassuring) You were always the strongest. The others recognized that. You were always their favorite. It burned you by touching you. It trapped you in a room. Who's to say what will happen next time? We have to find him before he does more damage.\nOLIVIA: So what was his name?\nWALTER: (remembers suddenly) I remember! He was Subject Nine.\nNINA: (to a room full of employees) Nanotechnology -- the bloom is not off the rose. Because of the far-ranging claims that have been made about potential applications of nanotechnology, a number of serious concerns have been raised about how this will affect our society if realized and what actions, if any are deemed appropriate, might be needed to mitigate these risks. This is not Massive Dynamic's concern. We create technology. How it is used is not our concern. We just own the patents. (sees that she has waiting visitors)\nNINA: (later. walking to a storage area) The Cortexiphan files were sealed for twenty years. I'm not even sure if all of them still exist. The files were lost, so to speak.\nWALTER: (into Astrid's ear while watching on videophone in his lab. IRATE!) We never destroyed files! Maybe she did. Viper!\nASTRID: (calmly back to Walter) Don't make me turn you off.\nWALTER: Well, tell her what I said. Ask her why she destroyed files. Go on, ask her!\nNINA: Maybe you can ask Walter if he remembers what group the boy was in. I mean, that may help.\nASTRID: Of course. Walter, did you hear that?\nWALTER: (maniacal) Yes. Her voice goes right into my inner ear and rattled around like razor blades. Of course I heard it. Tell her to go--\nASTRID: (politely to Nina) He said that he is not sure, but thank you for the suggestion.\nWALTER: I did not say that!\nNINA: Walter has said many things to me over the years, but \"thank you\" was never one of them. A word, Olivia?\nOLIVIA: (ushering Astrid into the secure storage area) I'll see you in there.\nNINA: So you told me about the Fringe Event, but I think you left something out. It's happening to you, isn't it? (motherly) Now, come on. I haven't seen this much fear in your face since Bobby Hastings asked you to the prom. So what can I do to help you, dear?\nOLIVIA: (delighted with her docent) You've done it. Walter thinks he knows how to deal with it. We just need to find the file.\nASTRID: (after Olivia rejoins her) So what were these trials all about, anyway?\nOLIVIA: Walter and William Bell thought that children had untapped extrasensory capabilities -- capabilities that are socialized out of us when we grow up. They wanted to tap into those abilities -- things like telekinesis, pyrokinesis, even the ability to cross over to another universe without a bridge.\nASTRID: And so they... experimented on kids.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\n(Walter has been silently listening to the two Agents talk, then turns off the connection at the mention of experimenting on children. he returns to chair and reflects on what he did in those tests)\nASTRID: So what happened to the program?\nOLIVIA: I left. I ran away. Walter said he and Bell shut it down a few years after that. (finds the electronic file) Here he is. His name's Cameron James.\nASTRID: (returning from her trip to Massive Dynamic HQ. finds Walter packed and ready to leave the lab) Walter, what are you doing?\nWALTER: Going with Agent Dunham, of course. Now that we know who he is and where we have to go to find him.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you haven't left the lab in three years.\nWALTER: (puts down his suitcase) You could be killed. I know the patient. I know his capabilities. (adamant) You do not. You need me. Without me, you can do nothing. (dons his cap and grabs his bag) Claire, will you please man the cameras in my absence?\nASTRID: Really? (blunt) Claire? That doesn't even start with an \"A.\"\nWALTER: (puts down his suitcase again) If you don't mind, I think I should urinate before we leave. (upbeat) Don't worry. I've packed us sandwiches.\n(Olivia keeps Walter on a short leash as they navigate the noisy, crowded urban sidewalks. Walter is out of sorts and stressed by all of the activity)\nWALTER: (after a loud vehicle horn honks nearby) Oh!\nOLIVIA: (noticing the defensive body language of the doctor) You okay?\nWALTER: (inundated with the sea of humanity and sensory inputs) Yes. Perfectly fine. Peachy.\nPEDESTRIAN: (sees that Walter is eyeballing him. rudely) You got a problem? (blows cigarette smoke in Walter's face as they pass one another)\nWALTER: (angry sarcasm) Fresh air... I'd forgotten how much I love it. (grimacing, half-hearted enthusiasm) Ah! I should've gotten out of the lab years ago.\nWALTER: (after Olivia knocks on the door of the apartment they think they are looking for) It must be nearly Six. I suppose we could wait for him to get home, or perhaps some of the neighbors know where he works. (notices that Olivia has decided to pick the lock of the unoccupied apartment) Can we do that?\nOLIVIA: (after she successfully picks the lock) Do what? (seeking his complicity in the crime she just committed) We got here, and the door was unlocked.\nWALTER: (complicit) Splendid.\nOLIVIA: (enters) Hello? (looks at the mail) We're in the wrong place. All this mail is addressed to Mark Little. Cameron James must have moved on.\nWALTER: (studies the room and its' fixtures) No. He still lives here. Look around. There's no metal anywhere. He's even changed the light fixtures.\nLANDLADY: (discovers the intrusion. approaches) Hey. Who are you? What are you doing in here?\nOLIVIA: Agent Dunham. FBI. (shows her credentials)\nLANDLADY: Oh.\nOLIVIA: We're looking for a Mark Little. You wouldn't happen to know where we could find him?\nLANDLADY: Is he -- is he in trouble? (busy-body attitude) He looked like the sort who could get into all sorts of trouble.\nOLIVIA: (matter-of-factly) We're not sure. That's why we wanted to ask him some questions.\nWALTER: (turns on his charm) I'm Walter Bishop. It's nice to meet you. (offers his hand)\nLANDLADY: (much more willing to talk since Walter introduced his charming self) Mark -- uh, he won't be back \u2018til tomorrow morning. He drives a supply truck for a furniture company back and forth to Maine. At least that's what he says he does. You never can tell with people.\nOLIVIA: So tomorrow morning -- you're sure?\nLANDLADY: Yeah. He's usually back by Ten. (smiles at Walter as he leaves the apartment)\nOLIVIA: Thank you. (follows Walter out)\nWALTER: (looking around his modest-sized room) Two hundred dollars a night? Look at this room. It's a veritable Petri dish. I can't imagine what I would see with a black light. Or worse, I can imagine.\nOLIVIA: (finds the remote control. attempts to distract Walter's growing obsession) Here. It also controls the temperature and the lights. And -- and this is for the TV.\nWALTER: Of course, if Belly were still here, he'd be delighted. You know, he and I used to argue about this. At what point does technology outpace its usefulness?\nOLIVIA: Walter, I'm gonna try and get some sleep. (trying to peacefully excuse herself) Can I get you anything before I go? Perhaps a glass of water?\nWALTER: (growing anxiety) Do you have any idea how many viruses a simple water glass can carry?\nOLIVIA: Okay. Well, if you need me, I'm right next door. (leaves Walter. enters her room. finds that the lights are working and starts to make a phone call... THUD, THUD... the common wall between her room and Walter's is shaking from the things that are being thrown against it. she races back to his door) Walter. Walter! Walter, it's me. I'm coming in. (swipes her access card and enters)\nWALTER: (throwing and breaking everything he can get his hands on. insanely ranting at his surroundings) Aah! Hair follicles on the bedspread, dead skin cells on the pillow, chocolate stains on the desk and strawberry juice on the carpet -- not to mention bodily fluids, seminal stains and phlegm....\nOLIVIA: Walter, its okay.\nWALTER: And urine on the carpet! Don't you realize the harm these pathogens can provoke? I tried to ignore that.\nOLIVIA: Walter...\nWALTER: I tried to ignore that!\nOLIVIA: (calmly trying to talk him down) Walter! There is nothing here that can hurt you. This is all in your mind. (they both that he has cut his hands and is bleeding from them. she gentle wraps them in gauze tape once he has calmed down) I'm sorry. Does that hurt?\nWALTER: (genuinely calm) Not as deeply as my pride. Mysophobia... I haven't had an attack in years.\nOLIVIA: It's curious, don't you think? The things that we see, that we investigate, and you don't bat an eye, and some harmless germs make you shake in your boots.\nWALTER: I suppose it is. Elizabeth, my wife, used to say I was a man of contradictions. She liked that about me. I liked everything about her. She committed suicide. Did you know that? After our Peter died. (reflecting) I'm glad she never knew me like this... afraid of things I can't even see.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I don't think I'm gonna get much sleep tonight either. What do you say to a root beer float? (generating a 'best idea all day' smile from Walter)\nWALTER: (sitting at a table near a large window overlooking the street) No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. (academic instruction) Let me show you how. You take the straw out of the glass, thusly. Then stab the ice cream... (plunges the straw hard. makes Olivia giggle) push the straw down to the root beer at the bottom, and then you suck up the ice cream and the soda simultaneously to deliver the perfect blend of sugary goodness, like so. (exaggerating for comic appeal) Mmm, mmm. Ahh. Better?\nOLIVIA: (amused. chuckling. nods) Better. Mmm.\nWALTER: (introspective and suddenly sullen) \"Does he pose a significant threat to himself or others?\"\nOLIVIA: Hmm?\nWALTER: The letter in your jacket from Saint Claire's. I wasn't snooping. I - I saw the emblem. (comes clean) Well, perhaps I was snooping a bit.\nOLIVIA: (apologetic. sincere) I'm sorry. You weren't supposed to see that.\nWALTER: It's alright. I've known for three years that this day would come sooner or later, that I was a burden to Fringe Division and to you.\nOLIVIA: Walter --\nWALTER: No need to sugarcoat it. I've never had any illusions about the nature of this relationship -- of our relationship. (states altruistically) I merely work for you. We're not family. If I should cease to be useful, if my behaviors are outweighing my value, well...\nOLIVIA: (realizes his master plan) That's why you left the lab, isn't it, Walter... to prove that you're capable?\nWALTER: I suppose tonight hasn't been my strongest showing.\nOLIVIA: (earnestly) I need you to understand that... whatever decision I make, I'm only trying to do what's best.\nWALTER: What's best for whom, Agent Dunham? (a metal spoon on the table starts to move around) Oh, dear.\n(a half-dozen patrons in the restaurant get to their feet when a large blue energy cloud starts to form in the center of the room. the apparition moves towards Olivia and Walter and everyone else starts to flee the area, trampling one another in the panic. sensing she may be cornered, Olivia grabs her pistol, then Walter, and shoots out the large glass window they were sitting next to so they can escape. the anomaly focuses on Olivia. she backs into the street while Walter watches from the sidewalk. an automobile drives down the street and nearly clips her. Walter's warning...)\nWALTER: Olivia! (gives her enough time to dive out of the way. the driver swerves around her, but collides with the blue entity. the car stops as if it hit a solid object. the large energy cloud evaporates into the night air)\n(after sun-up, the scene of the latest Fringe Event is still busy with emergency responders and investigators. the scrape on Olivia's forehead is minor. she doesn't need any more first-aid)\nOLIVIA: (to paramedic) Thank you. (approaches trench coat) Lieutenant Daniels? Special Agent Olivia Dunham.\nDANIELS: (all business) You're the Fed who's been pulling rank on my officers. I've got eyewitnesses reporting something that nobody seems to be able to explain. I've got a Federal Agent firing shots in public -- that's you. I've got a car that ran into a wall of blinding light. You want to tell me what the hell's going on here, Agent?\nOLIVIA: I don't know either. But like I told your officers, I can handle it from here. So we're gonna need the case files, witness statements, and also the security footage from above the cash register.\nDANIELS: (questioning her authority to make those demands) Before we discuss the handling of evidence, you're gonna have to explain to me exactly what your jurisdiction is here.\nOLIVIA: I think that this is all you'll need. (hands him a copy of her orders) The name at the top is my Division Chief, Phillip Broyles, and below that, his boss. I'm sure that you'll recognize that name.\nDANIELS: (reads her orders) Blanket Authority. (hands her the casework generated by his people) There you go.\n(Olivia joins Walter on the back step of the ambulance)\nPARAMEDIC: I tried to give him some soup, but he said he wasn't interested.\nOLIVIA: (to paramedic) Thank you. (sits. to Walter) We should go now. I want to be at Cameron James' apartment before he gets home.\nWALTER: This is because of what I did to all of you. (distressed over the impact Cortexiphan testing has had) This is because of me.\nWALTER: (entering the building) It's an indisputable fact. If I hadn't experimented with Cortexiphan, then none of this would be happening. Thirty-seven innocent children, and I just turned you into numbers, numbers in my head. I didn't follow up on a single child -- not even you.\nOLIVIA: Hey, Walter, you said before that the doses were so low, none of the children's abilities lasted any longer than twenty-four hours after treatment.\nWALTER: That's true. We couldn't have accounted for this. But if -- if Cameron is manifesting astral projection, then it must be inadvertent, which means that he may not even be aware of the damage he's creating.\nOLIVIA: Oh, no. This is purposeful. I can feel it. Okay. Walter, here. (directs him to wait near the front steps of the building)\nWALTER: Alone?\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: May I borrow your cell phone? I need to call Agent Farnsworth... to check on my project. (accepts her cell phone) Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (upstairs, after knocking on the apartment door) Mark Little?\nCAMERON JAMES: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Olivia Dunham, FBI. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.\nCAMERON JAMES: Um, sure. Anything you need. (as she passes him and enters the apartment) What's going on?\nOLIVIA: Well, I'm actually looking for a man named Cameron James. I was -- Hey! (as he dashes out the door he just held for her) Cameron! (has he scrambles down the staircase to freedom) Stop, Cameron!\n(the foot chase continues down the stairwell toward the lobby. Walter has moved inside and is summoning the elevator. Cameron comes flying around the corner and...)\nWALTER: Oh! (as his former test subject plows into him and they going sprawling across the floor. positive recognition) Cameron?\nCAMERON JAMES: (upsetting recognition) Aah! (Olivia catches up as the chandelier and elevator doors start to move swiftly back and forth)\nOLIVIA: (seconds later. pinning Cameron against the wall. very angry) Why?\nCAMERON JAMES: Who are you?\nOLIVIA: (very angry) Why are you coming after me? What do you want from me?\nCAMERON JAMES: What's he doing here?\nOLIVIA: (rapid fire) What do you want? What do you want from me?\nCAMERON JAMES: Leave me alone!\nWALTER: Olivia, please don't kill him.\nCAMERON JAMES: (recognition) Olive?\nOLIVIA: (intensely upset) Don't you lie to me. Why are you doing this to me?\nCAMERON JAMES: (honestly) I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't thought about you in years. Olive. Man look at you. You're okay.\nWALTER: No, no, no. The elevator, the lights. You're able to \u2018astral project\u2019.\nCAMERON JAMES: Listen, Doctor Freak. (charges angrily toward Bishop) I haven't been able to astral project since you...\nWALTER: (cowers and drops to the floor) Stop! Stop!\nCAMERON JAMES: ...stopped shoving needles in my arm when I was seven years old! Now, all I have are the bad side effects! (to Olivia) Anytime I have any kind of anxiety, I send metal flying. (forces himself to gain composure) So I have to stay calm. That's the funny thing about life. It's not always calm, you know? You want to hear about my last date? I take a girl for something to eat. I say something stupid. I see she saw I said something stupid. Suddenly, all the metal fillings are being pulled out of her mouth. (to Walter) So thanks for that.\nOLIVIA: Why did you change your name? What are you hiding from?\nCAMERON JAMES: (a little more composed. to Olivia) If I was hiding, I would've moved. Cameron James was my father's name. He was the one who signed me up for those experiments, made me use his name so he could access that pathetic trust fund they gave us. (to Walter) He took money from you so you could pump me full of drugs, then turned around and spent it on drugs himself. Hell of a guy. I don't know what kind of father does that. Not one I want to share a name with. You realize just what you did to me? If you had given me some special power, that'd be one thing. Maybe I'd be special. Or at least I'd be useful. Or if you'd just left me alone, I could have been normal, have a normal life with normal friends. Instead, I'm neither. I'm just a freak. Can you understand what that's like?\nWALTER: (thinks) I'm afraid I can. I'm sorry. I never meant to harm you.\n(metal objects in the lobby begin to move around violently again and they all back away from the blue energy field forming in the middle of the area)\nCAMERON JAMES: (loudly over the ruckus) I have nothing to do with this! (as the energy field moves quickly at them. yells as loud as he can) No! (the energy field dissipates and vanishes. the falls silent)\nWALTER: You stopped it.\nOLIVIA: (has a new, much bigger, concern) Walter, if he isn't doing this, what is?\nOLIVIA: Walter... you have to think of something.\nWALTER: (sitting. worried) I can't. There's nothing.\nOLIVIA: (somewhat desperate) Well, if it isn't Cameron, then what is it? And why is it coming after me?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nCAMERON JAMES: (confrontational) You don't know? Or are you just afraid to tell us?\nWALTER: You think I wouldn't tell you?\nCAMERON JAMES: (disappointed) You're not at all like I remember you. What happened to you?\nOLIVIA: (soothing. supportive) Walter... you must be able to think of something.\nWALTER: (touches her hand) It is possible that the electromagnetism isn't the root cause but a side effect of field distortions in time.\nOLIVIA: In time?\nWALTER: (gaining confidence) Yes. What we consider to be linear time. Now, that would explain the video in the lab. I witnessed effect before cause. If Cameron's reflexive magnetic discharge dispersed the energy event, then this thing, whatever it is, does not create magnetic fields. It \u2013 it -- it distorts those that already exist around us, focusing them, maybe tearing them open...\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWALTER: And I'm afraid it's going to keep returning until it's demolished, growing so large that it will consume everything in its path. (worried)\nOLIVIA: Okay. So how do we stop it?\nWALTER: Well, we gather together a large enough field of energy to neutralize the electromagnetism. In theory, it should shatter it.\nOLIVIA: Okay. So how do we do that?\nWALTER: We can't. (looks at Cameron) Only he can.\nWALTER: (coaching Cameron as they leave his apartment complex) You have the ability to gather and direct the kind of power we need.\nCAMERON JAMES: How?\nWALTER: You just did it in the hallway. Once when you were a boy, you blew up a toaster oven with your mind simply because of an irrational hatred of raisin toast.\nCAMERON JAMES: (sardonic) Have you ever had raisin toast?\nWALTER: I know. I was not correct that your abilities faded over time, but I am certain that their utility is based on your ability to focus your emotions. (positive) It's like the toaster oven, but on a grand scale.\nOLIVIA: (on phone) Thanks, Astrid. (hangs-up) Okay. There's a power grid terminal on the West Side.\n(the trio arrives at large electrical relay station in Olivia's car. exit the vehicle and enter the grounds after Olivia pops the lock on the chain link fence)\nCAMERON JAMES: What do we do now?\nWALTER: For whatever reason, the force seems to be drawn to Agent Dunham. So now we wait. When it attacks her again, you will combine your energy with the energy of the power grid to destroy it. (looks around the compound as the others stop in front of the large industrial insulators, capacitors and transformers)\nCAMERON JAMES: (privately) Have you heard about any of the others?\nOLIVIA: No. Have you?\nCAMERON JAMES: You're the first. I used to wonder about them a lot. Less so now, I guess. You haven't had any side effects from the experiments? (she shakes her head - no) You're really lucky. Or it's something else.\nOLIVIA: What are you saying?\nCAMERON JAMES: When I had my first experience, I thought something was coming after me, too... until I realized I was doing it to myself.\nOLIVIA: You think I'm doing this... that I'm bringing this on myself?\nCAMERON JAMES: I don't know. (looks at Walter wandering around) The question is, would he tell you if he thought you were? You weren't there anymore. But I remember he wasn't happy when the experiments stopped.\nWALTER: (zips-up after stopping to relieve his bladder) It's happening. It's happening! (runs back to his former test subjects) It's happening! Now, Cameron!\nOLIVIA: This isn't me. I am not doing this. (inadvertently creating the anomaly with her latent Cortexiphan abilities)\nWALTER: Do it, Cameron! (loudly as he approaches the entity) Direct it at the wall! Good! That's it! (as Cameron focuses his mind) Disperse the energy! Now, Cameron, before it's too late!\nOLIVIA: (just feet from the energy field. a familiar face forms. the one in her dreams and in Walter's lab) You.\nWALTER: Yes! That's it! It's working! (as the entity begins to dissipate and struggle) Stronger! Come on, destroy it!\nOLIVIA: Cameron, stop. (changing her mind completely about their mission) Cameron. Stop, Cameron!\nWALTER: Olivia, what are you doing?\nOLIVIA: Cameron! (fires her pistol into the air to interrupt his train-of-thought and focus)\n(a naked man bursts to the surface close to two fishermen in a row boat. the boaters row over to assist the seemingly distressed individual. a few hundred meters away, onshore, a bald man wearing a Fedora hat watches the unusual activity in the center of the lake)\n(standing and talking softly about the choice Olivia just made)\nOLIVIA: I'm telling you, Walter, I was not seeing things.\nWALTER: You're telling me it was him, the man?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nWALTER: The man I was seeing in the lab? The man you've been seeing in your dreams? Then why did you try to stop Cameron from destroying it?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I can't explain it. I just had a feeling that -- that... that he didn't want to hurt me, that he wanted my help.\n(walking to the car to leave)\nOLIVIA: You know, Cameron, if there's anything that I can do for you...\nCAMERON JAMES: (about Walter walking ahead of them) Make him forget about me.\nOLIVIA: (loading into the car) Walter... do you think we destroyed it? Do you think it's gone?\nWALTER: I can't be sure, Olivia. What you did may have compromised Cameron's ability. He may have just displaced it. You acted against all reasonable agreements and expectations. You behaved irrationally with regard to only your intuition and instincts.\nOLIVIA: I guess I did.\nWALTER: When I do that, people say I'm crazy. I suppose I've learned that crazy is a lot more complicated than people think.\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: (calling from his office) I just received a disturbing call. A father and son just pulled a man from the middle of Reiden Lake.\nOLIVIA: Where's Reiden Lake?\nBROYLES: Upstate New York. Details are sketchy, but apparently whoever he is knows a lot of classified information -- things no one outside this division could possibly know. What's more... he claims to know every one of us.\nWALTER: (after hearing Olivia's half of the call) I had a house at Reiden Lake.\nDOCTOR JANNS: (walks down the corridor to the waiting area) Sorry I kept you waiting so long.\nBROYLES: Phillip Broyles -- we spoke on the phone. (shakes hands)\nDOCTOR JANNS: He's stabilized. Vitals are good.\nBROYLES: Has he said anything else?\nDOCTOR JANNS: No. But he keeps talking about an Olivia Dunham.\nOLIVIA: (introduces herself) That's me. Can you take me to him?\nDOCTOR JANNS: Follow me. (heads back down the corridor)\nBROYLES: (cellphone rings. to Walter) Excuse me, Doctor. (walks away for privacy)\n(Walter starts to sit and wait. notices the paperwork in Olivia's pocket from Saint Claire's. looks around then decides to sneak another peek. her part of the form is filled-in now. she doesn't consider Walter a threat and recommends against returning him to the institution. somber relief )\nPETER: (alone is his room, until) Olivia. Thank God you're here.\nOLIVIA: (NOT A CLUE) Who are you?"

Broyles escorts the man who knows so much about his classified work to his new billet - a holding cell and observation room - upstairs with the multi-agency Fringe task force)\nOLIVIA: (enters the lab) Walter? Astrid? Walter? Walter? Walter. (finds the unresponsive doctor) What the hell are you doing?\nWALTER: (wakes) Sleeping. One syringe has sodium thiopental --\nOLIVIA: Well, that sounds...\nWALTER: ...It's a barbiturate, yes.\nOLIVIA: I was going to say dangerous.\nWALTER: Nonsense. And I have the adrenaline to wake me up.\nOLIVIA: Who sleeps like this?\nWALTER: Well, what choice do I have? Ah, I've been haunted for weeks with visions of a strange man. And now the stranger is here in the flesh, in our midst, and no one will let me examine him or even see him. I'm kept in the dark, knowing nothing. How's a man supposed to get some rest with all these uncertainties? Is he talking?\nOLIVIA: No. He was, but he stopped cooperating with us at the hospital. Broyles moved him to a holding facility in the Federal Building. Walter, he says that you're the only one he'll speak to.\nWALTER: Me?\nOLIVIA: He's saying that his name is Peter Bishop. He says he's your son.\nDONALD KELLEN: (enters the house after parking by the curb) Hello?\nKAREN TRUSS: (timidly after searching through all of the drawers and cabinets) Hi.\nDONALD KELLEN: (changing the subject of the well-searched room) I thought you said you hated that sweater.\nKAREN TRUSS: I thought I'd give it a second chance.\nDONALD KELLEN: What's all this? Looks like a cyclone went through here.\nKAREN TRUSS: I - I can't find the electric bill.\nDONALD KELLEN: You okay?\nKAREN TRUSS: Yeah. (notices a key chain on Don's belt) You're probably hungry. I should start dinner.\nDONALD KELLEN: I'll be right down.\n(Karen holds her pained hand then heads for the key chain when she thinks Don is in the shower. attempts to open a wall safe)\nDONALD KELLEN: (exits the bathroom early) Karen? What are you doing? (as her skin becomes translucent) Y - your face. Are you sick? W - what's wrong with your skin? K - Karen, what's --\nNADINE PARK: (the shapeshifter who has been morphed into Karen knocks down Don) Your research files -- are they in the safe?\nDONALD KELLEN: What? (looks under the bed and sees the real Karen - dead)\nNADINE PARK: Your files. Where are they?\nDONALD KELLEN: Karen! (trying to flee) Dear God. Oh, no. (as the shapeshifter reverts to another person) What the hell are you?\nNADINE PARK: (morphs back to her preferential form as Nadine) I'm only going to ask this once. (puts her hand on his throat and presses a thumb to the bridge of his nose) Tell me where the files are.\nDONALD KELLEN: I don't know what you're talking about. (as she punctures his skull with her thumb) Aah!\nWALTER: (exiting the elevator with Astrid on his arm) What makes you think there's any basis to his claims?\nBROYLES: (escorting them into the Situation Room) We were able to obtain a DNA sample from his I.V. at the hospital. There's a ninety-nine point seven percent probability that this man is, in fact, related to you.\nWALTER: We discovered another universe. There's no reason that there shouldn't be more out there we -- we're yet to find. Logic would dictate that this man could be another version of my -- another version of Peter from a third universe where he didn't die as a boy.\nOLIVIA: (joins the procession towards the holding cell) Walter, people from other universes don't just show up in your dreams.\nWALTER: (perturbed) He asked for my theory. I never claimed it was flawless.\nBROYLES: In any case, how did he get here?\nWALTER: The only way to find out is to ask him.\nBROYLES: My thoughts precisely. We prepared a list of questions. (hands-over a sheet of paper) This man possesses a lot of classified information about our division and all of us. I want to know how he got it.\nWALTER: (appeals to Olivia) Look, I'm -- I'm fairly sure I'm not the one best suited to this.\nASTRID: (soothing) You will be fine, Walter.\nOLIVIA: We'll be listening on the room's intercom. So, if at any point you want to leave, you just have to say so.\nPETER: (sitting quietly in his room when he is joined) Hello, Walter. You don't know who I am, do you? I know this must be confusing for you. But something's happened. And you're the only person who can help me.\nWALTER: (after sitting across from him) What do you want from me?\nPETER: I need you to help me figure out why no one remembers me, why you don't remember me.\nWALTER: (hesitant) I'll try.\nPETER: (looks at the observation window) There are two universes -- ours over here a - and another one that's just like it, just slightly different. The other universe is dying. And because they're interconnected, ours is dying as well.\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles and Astrid. listening in the observation room) How does he know all this?\nPETER: So you built a machine to save us, to form a bridge between the two worlds so that we could work together to heal them both. And you created it so that I was the power source. Only I could activate it, but you told me that when I did, there would be consequences.\nWALTER: (shakes his head - negative) There is a machine, but I didn't build it. I don't know who you are, what your agenda is, or why you claim to be my son.\nPETER: Do you have a son, Walter? You and Elizabeth -- did you have a son?\nWALTER: Yes. He died... a long time ago, when he was just a boy.\nPETER: (surprised) And then you found another version of him in the other universe. And he was dying, too. So you crossed over to save him.\nWALTER: Yes. But I couldn't.\nPETER: What do you mean you couldn't?\nWALTER: That lake where we crossed over was frozen. The ice broke. We fell through. I tried to hold on to him... but he drowned.\nPETER: The Observer didn't pull us out of the lake that night? Well, that must be it, Walter.\nASTRID: (to her colleagues as they eavesdrop) What's an Observer?\nPETER: It all makes sense now. That has to be what happened. I was supposed to die that night in both universes, but when I didn't, I became a paradox, and now, for the two worlds to heal, I had to be deleted. But if I'm already dead in both universes, then why am I here? How am I back? Something's gone wrong, Walter. Something's happened.\nWALTER: (angry. rejects friendly physical contact. to those listening-in) We're finished here. Take me back to my lab. Please, I'd like to go now!\nPETER: No, please, I need your help. Walter--\nWALTER: I want to leave!\nPETER: (forceful reason) Walter, I need your help. You have to help me figure out what went wrong. If I'm not supposed to be here, then how am I back?\nWALTER: (to Astrid as they march to the elevator) We need to get back.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nWALTER: (fading rant) We need to get back to the lab.\nOLIVIA: (to her caller) Where are you?\nOLIVIA: (meets Lee on the front steps and follows him inside) You want to tell me why you dragged me to a robbery-homicide?\nAGENT LEE: Victim's skin is translucent. (as forensics snaps pictures) Since Robert's murder, I've been keeping up with local police bulletins, looking for anything that came across the wire with a similar M.O.\nOLIVIA: (kneeling over Karen's corpse) See, I thought we killed the last of these things at the train yards.\nAGENT LEE: Apparently not. Her heart was stopped, same as the others. I think the shapeshifter took on the wife's form to get access to the home. I ran background on the victims. You are standing in the home of Doctor Malcolm Truss... a research scientist who worked at Massive Dynamic in their BioTech Department. Left the company ten years ago.\nOLIVIA: (studies the corpse of the man she thinks is Doctor Truss) Huh. Interesting. He was tortured, so he must have known something the shapeshifter wanted. There's grease under his fing...\nAGENT LEE: ...fingernails. Yeah, I know. Not too many bio-scientists work at garages. (holds up a bagged work shirt with a garage log)\nOLIVIA: So this is...\nAGENT LEE: Mrs. Truss' unlucky boyfriend, Donald Kellen. Doctor Truss doesn't live here anymore. They separated a few years ago, but the house is still in his name.\nOLIVIA: So the shapeshifter came here looking for Truss, didn't find him, which means it's still looking.\nAGENT LEE: Problem is, we can't find him either. After they separated, uh, Doctor Truss went off-the-grid. We're still trying to pull an address for him.\nOLIVIA: Well, we should hurry on that. (leaves the victims bedroom)\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (tends to his considerable, colorful garden in the foothills of rural Vermont. singing to himself) Oh, baby. What you gonna do when the water's all gone? Tell me baby... (a large, friendly dog approaches) Hey, Sebastian. (the dogs gets nervous and flees)\nNADINE PARK: (walking from the house toward the sunny garden) Malcolm Truss? You're Doctor Malcolm Truss? You worked at Massive Dynamic, correct?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (protective of his reclusive lifestyle) Okay, look, I \u2013 I - I don't know who you are, young lady, but I suggest you leave. (as a 9mm pistol is leveled at his face) You are trespassing on priv.... (drops some pottery)\nNADINE PARK: (dead serious) I'm gonna need your help.\nAGENT LEE: (waiting in Nina's office, he finds a picture on display) Hey, Olivia. This photo, the girl with the riding ribbon -- is that you?\nOLIVIA: (disinterested) Yeah.\nAGENT LEE: (curious) Okay. You -- you're gonna have to do better than that. Why does Nina Sharp have your photo in her office?\nOLIVIA: After our mother died, my sister and I were due to go into the foster system. Instead, Nina pulled some strings, and... we went to live with her.\nAGENT LEE: (eyebrows raised) So the Acting C.E.O. of one of the richest companies in... the world - was your Nanny?\nOLIVIA: Something like that.\nNINA: (enters her office) Sorry to keep you waiting. Nina Sharp. You must be Agent Lee. (shakes hands) Phillip tells me that you're a very welcome addition to our team.\nAGENT LEE: Lincoln. It's nice to meet you.\nNINA: Phillip also told me about the man claiming to be Peter Bishop. How's Walter handling it?\nOLIVIA: Not very well.\nNINA: Oh, well, that's unfortunate. Is there anything I can do to help?\nOLIVIA: I don't think so. Uh, we're here on a different matter, though. Doctor Malcolm Truss? He used to work for Massive Dynamic, but he left the company maybe ten years ago.\nNINA: The name doesn't ring a bell. Let's see what we can find. (pulls-up a personnel file on the monitor) Ah, I remember Doctor Truss -- graduated M.I.T. in 'Eighty-Two, came to work for us in 1993, left in 2001.\nAGENT LEE: What kind of projects was he working on?\nNINA: Well, several. Perhaps if you told me why you're interested in him, I might be a better help.\nOLIVIA: He was abducted from his house in Vermont this morning, and we think a shapeshifter was responsible.\nNINA: A shapeshifter? But what would a shapeshifter want with Malcolm Truss?\nAGENT LEE: We were hoping you could tell us.\nNINA: (thinks. remembers) There was one project Malcolm was working on-- (calls the project up on the big screen) cellular replication. It was designed to help patients with extensive tissue damage -- burn victims, cancer patients, amputees. It copied the genetic data of the healthy cells of the patient and used it to replace the damaged ones. Malcolm was in charge of it.\nOLIVIA: And did it work?\nNINA: No, he never had a chance to find out. William shut the project down, citing ethical concerns.\nAGENT LEE: Ethical concerns?\nNINA: Yes. But I only bring it up because the project was based on copying human tissue.\nOLIVIA: Kind of like shapeshifting.\nNINA: Hmm.\nNADINE PARK: (holding her pistol in the passenger seat as Truss drives down the rural two-lane roadway. makes her case) There are people who think very highly of your work and you.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: What people?\nNADINE PARK: You don't know them, but they know you. They share your vision. They will pay you to continue your research.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: You always bring a gun to a business proposal?\nNADINE PARK: I couldn't take the chance you'd say no. We need your help.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: Help with what? I don't know what you're hoping to find in those files. That work never went anywhere. It's useless.\nNADINE PARK: (displays the unique skin on her upper chest) I was terminally ill. Stage Four melanoma when they came to me.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: Cellular replication? They did it?\nNADINE PARK: The cancer went into complete remission. It was a miracle... at least for a while. But the procedure didn't fully take. The cells -- they aren't stable. My cancer is gone, but.. I'm still dying. (sells her lie with a deep sigh)\nMALCOLM TRUSS: There are no files.\nNADINE PARK: What?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: It's all up here. (taps his head) I'll do it, Nadine. I'll help you. But just so you know, I - I don't do my best work at gunpoint.\n(Peter can't hear what is being said about him in the Situation Room so he rewires the intercom panel in his detention cell)\nOLIVIA: (walking from the elevator) Walter said the Shapeshifters that we encountered at the train yards weren't able to complete their shifts, that they were flawed.\nBROYLES: And this has to do with Doctor Truss how?\nOLIVIA: Uh, well... the, uh, cellular replication project he was working on... they might require his expertise.\nBROYLES: So you're suggesting Malcolm Truss was kidnapped so the shapeshifter could perfect itself.\nOLIVIA: If the shapeshifter needs Malcolm to fix itself, then they need equipment -- medical supplies -- which means they're on the move.\nAGENT LEE: Malcolm's car was missing from his home. We put the, uh, plates and car's make out to local P.D.\nBROYLES: Well, if the shapeshifter's flawed, then it might have something to do with the tech Doctor Bishop pulled from inside the two we killed at the train yard.\nOLIVIA: Maybe that's what's malfunctioning.\nAGENT LEE: I checked with Tech Services. They don't even know what the device is, the purpose it serves...\nPETER: (jumps into the conversation he had been eavesdropping on from his holding cell) ...they're memory disks. I've seen them before. Those devices you're talking about, they're memory disks.\nBROYLES: (looks at the jury-rigged intercom as he storms into Peter's cell) What do you know about shapeshifters?\nPETER: Quite a lot, actually.\nBROYLES: Enlighten me.\nPETER: Well, I know if you shoot them in the head, they bleed Mercury.\nBROYLES: Those are the old ones. What about the new ones -- the human shapeshifters?\nPETER: (not aware) The what?\nBROYLES: They're prototypes, human hybrids.\nAGENT LEE: Tell us about the memory disks.\nPETER: Look, they're a lot more than that, actually. The disks are divided up into three different partitions -- cognitive functions, biochemical functions, and mission objective.\nBROYLES: And you know all this how?\nPETER: Because I've decrypted a couple of them myself.\nAGENT LEE: If you've decrypted their tech before, you think you could do it again?\nBROYLES: (establishing authoritative boundary) I'll ask the questions, Agent Lee.\nAGENT LEE: (matter-of-factly) We've been sitting on this tech for weeks. Our people aren't able to crack it. What's the harm in letting him try?\nBROYLES: (petulance) You about done?\nPETER: Lincoln has a point. What is the harm in letting me try?\nOLIVIA: (trying to assess motive) What is it that you're after? You're obviously not doing this out of the goodness of your heart, so what is it that you want?\nPETER: I just want to talk to Walter again.\nOLIVIA: Well, we tried that already. In case you didn't notice, it didn't go so well. I don't see the point in letting you upset him again.\nPETER: I'm sorry about that. I was talking to him like he was the man that I knew, which clearly he is not. He's different, just like you are. But I need his help. And you need mine.\nAGENT LEE: Anyone have a better idea?\nOLIVIA: I'll see what I can do.\n(Walter sits and opens an old metal lunch pail that holds trinkets from his son's childhood. he examines a few of the items, holds one to his ear. studies the coin Peter was fond of and tries the manual dexterity exercise they were both so keen to master)\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (after stopping at a pump in a countryside gas station) I hope you have money. (sees a trickle from the nose after she steps from the vehicle) You're bleeding. You should wash up. I'll take care of this. I told you I would help you, Nadine. I meant it. (looks at wallet photo while cash is being retrieved) She's adorable. Is that your little girl?\nNADINE PARK: (thinks quickly) Yes... my daughter, Hayley. (that\u2019s the ticket)\nMALCOLM TRUSS: That's a pretty name. Karen, my wife... she always wanted kids. I was too busy with work. And when that ended, I guess I was just too angry to think about what she wanted. Still... I guess I'm hoping that one day she'll let me be a part of her life again. (takes cash to pay for fuel as Park heads for the restroom)\nSTATE TROOPER: (stops in driveway behind the suspect vehicle) Dispatch, this is Sierra Two Four. I think I've got a visual on that stolen plate they put the BOLO out on, over.\nDISPATCH: Go ahead, Sierra Two Four.\nSTATE TROOPER: Plate reads Five Lima Tango Three One Six. Over.\nDISPATCH: Yeah, that's the plate. Be advised, Sierra Two Four, the suspect is armed and dangerous. Stand down and wait for backup, over.\nSTATE TROOPER: Roger that -- waiting for backup. Sierra Two Four out. (turns and finds the shapeshifter about to pounce on him)\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (inside, returns to the clerk at the cashier's counter) And, uh, Twenty on Pump Two. (returns to his car. sees Vermont State Police vehicle parked and empty. rejoins Park in his car) Ready?\nNADINE PARK: Yep.\n(the two drive away from the station. what Truss did not see was the State Trooper stuffed under the rear axle of his cruiser)\n(as Peter toils away in a room full of test equipment, working with a soldering iron)\nAGENT LEE: (returning to their desks) Okay, our mystery man is all set up with the device we got off the shapeshifter. And I requisitioned all of the equipment he asked for.\nOLIVIA: And do you think that he's confident he can do something with it?\nAGENT LEE: He seems pretty confident, in general. Olivia... I may have only met you a few weeks ago, but I think I know you well enough to know that this guy's gotten to you. You didn't ask me to take him that tech because you had a dentist appointment.\nOLIVIA: He was in my dreams, and now he's here. I \u2013 I - I can... maybe understand why he would be in Walter's head, if he's some iteration of his son, but... why mine?\nAGENT WARRICK: (approaches) Okay, we got a hit on Malcolm Truss' plates -- two hours from here, Rutland, Vermont.\nOLIVIA: (looking at security gas station security footage in Rutland) Truss comes in at 11:53 A.M., pays for his gas in cash, alone.\nAGENT LEE: Not exactly the behavior of someone being held against their will. Seems more like an accomplice.\nOLIVIA: Unless he doesn't know he's with a shapeshifter.\n(after the long drive to the coast, finds a secure warehouse among the industrial docks)\nNADINE PARK: (flips on the lights in a very well equipped R&D laboratory) The people I work for built this lab according to the specifications in your file. Automated tissue micro-arrayer, blood gas analyzer, centrifuges. I think you'll find we've got everything you'll need.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (once he gets Park on the examination table) This is amazing. The artificial tissue has adapted... remarkably well. Considering the extent of the grafting, it's lucky your body didn't reject it. The fact that you're even alive is nothing short of a miracle.\nNADINE PARK: Then I suppose that would make you a miracle-worker. After all, the grafts were based on your research. (stands-up and buttons-up)\nMALCOLM TRUSS: I never thought I'd say this, but... I wish William Bell were alive... just so he could see you. (sits and reminisces) I truly believed that the work that we were doing was going to change the world. And just like that... Bell shut down the project. And all he could say was, \"Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things... are God's.\"\nNADINE PARK: One man shouldn't stand in the way of progress, not even William Bell.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (walks to monitor to check her test results) Well, the good news is I found the source of the cellular degeneration. Uh, your genome isn't fully propagating through the artificial tissues.\nNADINE PARK: Can you fix it?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (career payoff) I had hoped this day would come. (confident) Yes, I can.\nNINA: (catches him unaware as he works) Hello, Walter.\nWALTER: (avoids eye contact) Nina.\nNINA: I'm probably the last person in the world you want to see right now. But Olivia said you weren't doing so well. This man claiming to be your son, Walter... if there was ever a time to try to get past our differences, it seemed like now.\nWALTER: (finishes whisking) I'm fine. The man is a scientific anomaly, nothing more.\nNINA: Walter, you're making Peter's favorite dessert.\nWALTER: (distant. angered) I find that baking custard calms me. Seeing this man has brought up many things I've tried to forget. That night at the lake, you begged me to stop, but I couldn't. I couldn't watch Peter die, not again. I couldn't stand by and do nothing.\nNINA: (conciliatory) Walter --\nWALTER: (direct eye contact) I've hated you. For twenty-five years, I hated you. Had you not been there, the vial wouldn't have been broken, and I would've healed Peter on the other side. He wouldn't have fallen through the ice. I blamed you for the death of my son. I blamed you. I couldn't live with myself... because you were right. I'd crossed the line. For the sake of one life, I destroyed two worlds. And over the years, I've come to terms with the fact that I deserve to be punished... to suffer.\nNINA: No. Walter, you're not that man anymore. I've watched you. Working with the Fringe Division, you've done everything in your power to heal the damage.\nWALTER: I saw him, Nina... the man. I saw my boy in that man's eyes. (visualizing the past) The way he looked that night in the ice... floating away from me. God help me, I... saw the eyes of my boy in a man's face. That filled me with... indescribable joy. But I don't deserve joy. For anyone else, this would be received as a miracle -- to get a glimpse of their dead son. Why should I be rewarded for what I've done?\nNINA: Because maybe you've suffered enough. No, I can't explain it, Walter. I don't know why he's here. (steps closer for some friendly advice) I don't know where he came from, but maybe you've just been given a second chance.\nBROYLES: (enters the holding cell) I was told you found something.\nPETER: (refers to laptop monitor) It's a DNA sequence.\nBROYLES: Meaning what exactly?\nPETER: Meaning I found six distinct genetic profiles on that memory from the shapeshifter tech. Apparently these things are able to switch between every single identity they've ever taken, not just one.\nBROYLES: That's gonna make it a lot more difficult to find them.\nPETER: No, it's gonna make them impossible to find. The new, improved models do a lot more than just take on the appearance of another person. They replicate their victims down to the molecular level, including every last strand of DNA.\nBROYLES: You're saying these shapeshifters will be completely indistinguishable from whoever they're impersonating?\nPETER: They're the perfect infiltrators. By transforming their DNA, they can become anyone. They perfect this technology, and they can get close to us. They could replace any one of us. And short of performing surgery to find those memory disks, you would have absolutely no way of knowing.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: Okay. You should lie back. You may feel a little nauseous. Nadine? (as she morphs into Karen) What the hell?\nNADINE PARK: (as Karen) What is it?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: Why do you look like my wife?\nNADINE PARK: (as Karen. grabs him by the collar) You said you were going to help me, Malcolm, and you will.\n(sitting in his holding cell. makes a new discovery on his computer)\nPETER: (urgently on his holding cell intercom) Get me Broyles, now.\nBROYLES: (enters the cell) Progress?\nPETER: This thing's broadcasting some kind of signal.\nBROYLES: To who?\nPETER: Well, that's just the problem. I can't break the high-grade encryption without a significant increase in CPU cycles.\nBROYLES: Meaning?\nPETER: I need a bigger computer. (hooking-up to the big screen in the Situation Room. mumbles to himself) Just like old times... sort of.\nBROYLES: (standing in room full of agents) How long is this gonna take?\nPETER: Not long at all.\nOLIVIA: Those are coordinates.\nBROYLES: To what?\nPETER: (to assistant) Could you pull me up a map of the city? (to assembled agents) So what do luxury cars and shapeshifters have in common? They both have LoJack \u00ae systems apparently.\nAGENT LEE: You're saying these things have -- have tracking devices?\nPETER: Yeah, I think whoever's in charge wants to keep an eye on his agents. That's the one that you guys have here. The one we just hooked up. But there are actually two different sets of coordinates being broadcast.\nAGENT LEE: That's by the Port.\nBROYLES: I think you just found our shapeshifter.\nPETER: For the time being. But whoever's monitoring that network, they're going to know that I breached it. They can shut down our access at any time.\nOLIVIA: (marches toward the exit) We should move.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (trauma drama) How did you do that? Why did you look like my wife?\nNADINE PARK: (wipes nose. exasperated) My offer was sincere... to continue your research with people who'd provide the resources to complete your work.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: What people? Why did you look like my wife?\nNADINE PARK: (school marmish) Malcolm, it's not important right now.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (demanding) Why did you look like my wife?\nNADINE PARK: Malcolm... (softening her tone for the sales pitch) great progress requires great sacrifice. Your work created me. Malcolm, you need to step back and see things objectively as a scientist. You let go of Karen long ago for a greater purpose. Don't let that all be for nothing. I'm offering you something precious... an opportunity to take back what William Bell took from you... your legacy.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (thinks. considers his actions) It may be possible... to alter the compound... to accommodate... multiple genomes. (modifies the serum he was developing)\nNADINE PARK: How?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: We need to induce a state of permanent hyper-replication. (as she grabs and crushes his hand) Ah!\nNADINE PARK: What are you doing?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: I am adding a bonding agent.\nNADINE PARK: (not fooled) I'm familiar enough with biochemistry to know that restriction enzymes would fragment my DNA and trigger a massive internal hemorrhage.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (hand broken) Ah!\nNADINE PARK: Finish what you started. I won't ask again.\nOLIVIA: (after her team has assembled at the gate of Clifford's Seafood Exchange) Okay, we'll take front. You go on my signal.\nNADINE PARK: How much longer?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (pained by his broken hand) Five minutes for the centrifugation process. And then we'll know if the serum's complete.\nOLIVIA: (with Lee close-by) Team One in position.\nAGENT WARRICK: Team Two in position. On your go.\n(in the firefight that ensues after charging into the warehouse lab. Truss is tossed aside when he completes the serum for Park)\nOLIVIA: (as Park evades to the roof) I got her.\nAGENT WARRICK: (as Park super-humanly leaps off a sidewall to the upper level) Oh, my God. She's headed to the roof.\nOLIVIA: (catches up to Team Two. passes one unconscious man and finds...) This is Agent Dunham. Agent Warrick is down. We need paramedics on the roof now.\nAGENT WARRICK(?): She jumped.\n(Lee and Dunham follow EMS out of the warehouse as they wheel Agent Warrick to the ambulance on a gurney. Olivia detours to the left to have a chat with Malcolm, tending to his damaged arm nearby)\nOLIVIA: Mister Truss? Agent Olivia Dunham. Uh, I understand that it's been a long day. We're just going to need to get a statement from you. And then an agent will take you home.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (hoping for better news) What that... thing said about Karen... it's true, isn't it? She's dead?\nOLIVIA: H.P.D. found your wife in her home this morning. I'm so sorry.\nMALCOLM TRUSS: (thoughtful) It's my fault. \"Some things are not ours to tamper with.\"\nOLIVIA: Excuse me?\nMALCOLM TRUSS: It's something someone said to me once. I didn't understand it at the time. But I do now.\nAGENT LEE: (watching the dock) Dunham!\nOLIVIA: (to Truss) Excuse me.\nAGENT LEE: (after she joins him) The dive team -- they just found a body.\nOLIVIA: That's not our shapeshifter.\nAGENT LEE: That's Agent Warrick.\nOLIVIA: (urgently. on the phone) Get dispatch on the line. We need all available units on that ambulance now.\n(a patrol officer finds the ambulance that was transporting the injured 'Agent Warrick' that Olivia found on the warehouse roof. the driver is dead and the back of the vehicle is abandoned)\nAGENT RUIZ: Agent Dunham, I have those hourlys you asked for. (hands over files)\nOLIVIA: Thank you, Jill. (puts the stack of files down on a desk)\nOLIVIA: I sent the reports to Broyles, so all the paperwork is done.\nAGENT LEE: Thanks.\nOLIVIA: We're gonna find her, Lincoln. I mean, look at how much more we know now than we did this morning.\nAGENT LEE: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: Do you want to go get a bite to eat or something?\nAGENT LEE: No. Uh, thank you. I, um--I'm going to head back to the hotel. Good night.\nOLIVIA: Night.\nAGENT RUIZ: (approaches from a different direction) Agent Dunham, I have those hourlys that you asked for.\nOLIVIA: Uh... didn't we already do this?\nAGENT RUIZ: I'm sorry?\nOLIVIA: You already gave me the fi-- (turns to the desk she thought she put the files down on. the desk is barren)\nAGENT RUIZ: Agent Dunham, are you alright? (hands over the files)\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Just a little tired, I think. Thank you.\n(laying on his cot with his eyes wide open, the latest Fringe case receives a visitor)\nWALTER: (after being escorted into the secured room. approaches gently) Are they feeding you?\nPETER: Yeah. (pauses. gathers his thoughts) Walter, I know how strange this all is, how hard it must be for you, but I don't know what to do. Nobody remembers me here. (shrugs) Olivia looks at me like I'm a stranger, like she's afraid of me. I know what you're capable of. (earnest) I need your help Walter, to fix this.\nWALTER: (steps in front of the man seated before him. puts his hands on the cheeks of his son) Every day... for the past twenty-five years... I've tried to imagine what you would look like as a man... my son. (removes his hands) But I don't deserve this. I don't deserve you. I realize now this was my punishment. (collapsing emotionally) You were sent to tempt me, to see if I would repeat the mistakes of the past. You shouldn't be here.\nPETER: (authoritatively) Walter, no.\nWALTER: (wanders to the door) Wherever you came from, however you got here, it doesn't matter. I can't help you.\nPETER: Walter, you don't understand.\nWALTER: I tried to help a boy, a version of my son, twenty-five years ago. (resigned) But that boy was never my son... and neither are you. (knocks for exit. leaves. Peter stews)\n(the shapeshifter that abducted, then befriended and manipulated, Malcolm Truss is in a desperate state. she injects the serum that he created in the warehouse lab, her discomfort eases and her skin stops fluctuating into translucency. wearing a paramedics uniform, she finds a specific storage locker in the large terminal and removes a box containing an older style typewriter. she finds a secluded place and types in a few lines - Status Report: Doctor Truss located. Serum synthesized successfully. - A few seconds after she finishes, the typeset in the machine activates - Understood. Begin preparations. We're sending the others. - )"

(prone on a public park lawn. she is joined by)\nPETER: Oh, I don't think so. It took me three years to finally get you. You're not getting rid of me that easily.\nOLIVIA: Where'd you disappear to?\nPETER: I was checking up on Walter. He found the swing set, and you know how he feels about Newtonian Mechanics. (as Walter swings in the playground)\nOLIVIA: You know what this is?\nPETER: The perfect day.\nOLIVIA: Yes. The perfect day. (after they kiss) It's too bad it has to end.\nPETER: And why would it have to end?\nOLIVIA: We can't ignore the problem, Peter. Ignoring it won't make it go away.\nPETER: I don't understand. What's the problem? What's wrong, Olivia?\nOLIVIA: You, Peter. You're the problem. (as he bolts from REM sleep. after security unlocks the door to his holding cell) I'm sorry if I woke you up.\nPETER: (sits-up) That's alright. I was already awake.\nOLIVIA: There's something going on. And we think it has something to do with you. With your appearance here.\nPETER: Okay. What kind of something?\nOLIVIA: We're not sure. But we think it has to do with time.\nSAMANTHA: (runs through the halls of their apartment and into the kitchen) Mommy. Mommy, look what I caught.\nANN: (playfully feigns fear) ...ewww, get it away from me.\nSAMANTHA: Got you. It's fake, Mommy. See.\nANN: Thank goodness. 'Cause you never know when a spider's gonna get you. Okay, I'm almost done here, and then we'll read together, okay? What are you in the mood for?\nSAMANTHA: \u2018Burlap Bear\u2019.\nANN: \u2018Burlap Bear\u2019. That's my favorite. (instantly, she is standing in the charred remains of her kitchen) Samantha? Sam? Sam, where are you? (runs to uncharred bedroom and finds an infant crying) Oh, my God. (grabs the infant and flees to safety in the street with fellow tenants. holding the infant in her arms she watches as the smoldering high-rise quarters instantly revert back to an undamaged state)\nSAMANTHA: (after instantly reverting back to her non-infant state) Mommy. Mommy, what is it?\nANN: (stunned) Oh, my. Sam. (mom hugs)\nOLIVIA: (chatting while she drives) So what are you thinking?\nPETER: First chance I've had to look outside since I got back. (taking in the scenery) Looks exactly like I remembered.\nOLIVIA: Uh, I meant, what do you think about what I told you in regard to the time anomalies?\nPETER: Oh. Uh... people in Boston reporting strange events of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nOLIVIA: Well, it's not just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Some of them are reporting time loops.\nPETER: I don't really know what that means. I mean, what is a time loop? Like Groundhog Day? Look, I'm not trying to be difficult, but what does this have to do with me anyway?\nOLIVIA: Shortly before you arrived, we experienced our own anomalies having to do with time... strange reversals in cause and effect.\nPETER: Is that why you're taking me to Massive Dynamic? To run more tests? You think these time anomalies may be because of me?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: So what's Walter's theory?\nOLIVIA: Walter doesn't have a theory. He's made it pretty clear that he doesn't really want to have anything to do with you. (answers cell call) Dunham.\nAGENT LEE: (over speakerphone) Hey, it's Lincoln. There's been another incident.\nASTRID: (on video earpiece back to the lab. spraying an aerosol) Walter, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.\nWALTER: (sitting in his lab reading the users manual for their new detection technology) Hang on. Here it is. \"A short emission should indicate universe breach and extend to the infected area.\" Did you spray?\nASTRID: Yeah. Twice. (reading the handheld detector) No reaction.\nWALTER: Maybe third time's the charm.\nASTRID: (sprays again. checks the detector) Negative. There's no change in color or anything.\nWALTER: It would seem that this event is not caused by a bleed-through from the other universe. Well, it's a wonderful device nonetheless, despite the poorly-written instruction manual.\nOLIVIA: (enters the apartment. to Peter) Okay, you just stay here, don't touch anything, and don't talk to anyone.\nBROYLES: (updates Olivia) It looks like there was a fire here but with no apparent cause. The damage just happened in an instant.\nOLIVIA: A flash fire?\nBROYLES: Except there were no flames. And that's not the weirdest part. According to the mother, for the duration of the event, her daughter went from being a five-year-old to an infant.\nSAMANTHA: (in the child's bedroom. packing to move out) Mommy, where's Emily?\nANN: Samantha, it's okay. We can buy a new one.\nSAMANTHA: I don't want a new one. I want Emily.\nANN: Well, are you sure you didn't put her somewhere else?\n(Peter walks into the bedroom and studies the burn pattern while the ladies pack)\nSAMANTHA: She was here. I remember. We were having a circus. And you can't have a circus without an elephant.\nPETER: (finds the stuffed toy and presents it) Is that Emily?\nSAMANTHA: Emily! (grabs the toy)\nPETER: (to Ann) A little smoky, but otherwise okay.\nANN: Thank you.\nSAMANTHA: Emily. Let's see.\nPETER: (returns to Olivia waiting outside of the bedroom) So you really think I caused all this?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nAGENT LEE: (to Broyles) Fire Marshal says they've never seen anything like it. Some areas burnt next to places that are completely undamaged.\nASTRID: (to Lee) The outside wall had scorch marks that made a perfect circle. It's almost like the fire burned in the shape of a ball.\nAGENT LEE: Fire Marshal said that there was another fire here four years ago.\nOLIVIA: Well, that fits with what the woman was saying about her daughter becoming an infant.\nAGENT LEE: So we're thinking what, that this whole place flashed back to four years ago?\nBROYLES: (about Peter) We need to get him back to the lab. I want Doctor Bishop to run those tests immediately.\nOLIVIA: Walter is refusing to do anything that involves him.\nBROYLES: (authoritatively) Doctor Bishop doesn't get to choose which cases he works and which he doesn't. It's his job to investigate Fringe Events, and, until something suggests otherwise, he is a Fringe Event.\nWALTER: (conducts a body scan. indifferent) The subject can lower the arms.\nPETER: You can call me Peter.\nWALTER: (aggressively indifferent. gruff) Subject does not have an elevated radiation level. Nor does it have any trace chemical signatures. Subject appears to be solid, not phasing in and out of existence. (to Olivia) You can inform Agent Broyles that I've completed the examination, and I conclude that this subject is not the cause of the time-related phenomena.\nPETER: (trying to follow as Walter marches away) Walter, you couldn't possibly know that so quickly. If I was erased from this timeline and then thrown back into it, then it stands to reason those two things could be related.\nWALTER: (back turned. negative eye contact. to Olivia) I'll be in my bedroom working on the problem. (emotional fence-sitter) I do not wish to be disturbed. (close himself in his office)\nPETER: (returns to Olivia) He lives here? Since when?\nOLIVIA: Since I checked him out of a mental institution three years ago. Now - this lab is the only place that he feels safe.\nPETER: (looks around the lab at the tools available to him) Okay. If he won't help me, I'll just do it myself. (rolls out a large dry-erase board) Does he still keep all his notes on worm holes in the bathroom?\nOLIVIA: You think this has something to do with time travel?\nPETER: No. Not exactly. I think this has something to do with time displacement. And I think that, when I came back here, I somehow damaged the space-time continuum. And, if that's the case, there may not actually be any rules to it. (starts writing equations on the board)\nOLIVIA: Like the apartment. The fire and the baby. The mother didn't revert to a younger age, but her daughter did.\nPETER: Yeah. Precisely. I can't explain it yet, but, as far as I can tell, these anomalies are just gonna keep on increasing exponentially. I mean, if we can judge anything by the damage done by that fire in the apartment, these things are just gonna keep on getting worse.\n(three teens drive on a remote road that parallels a set of old rail tracks, late for that night's concert)\nCREEPER: We're already over an hour late. Why does this always happen?\nDYLAN: Relax, Creeper. We're totally gonna make it in time for the bands that don't suck anyway.\nBACKSEAT PAX: Whatever. You just think Aluminum Rain rules the known universe.\nDYLAN: Yeah, some day they're gonna make it big and you two are gonna say you liked 'em all along.\nBACKSEAT PAX: Dylan, this is my solemn promise. I will never say that I liked Aluminum Rain.\nCREEPER: (approaching the bend in the road that crosses the old tracks) Look out!\nBACKSEAT PAX: Oh, my God. (the trio exit the vehicle after Dylan slams on the brakes to avoid hitting the train that is racing out the void, then back into the void - only a few feet away)\nPETER: (finishes posting equation. frustrated. snaps book closed) This is not working. I've got too many competing theories. I can't balance the equation. There's too many variables and not enough constants. (equation crossed-out)\nOLIVIA: (sitting at workstation) Look at this. (computer monitor) There have been sixty-five time slips in the past seventy-two hours, all of which occurred within a forty-mile radius of Downtown Boston. So because most people don't call in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to the FBI, we can assume that there is at least twice as many unreported. Now I've categorized all of the events... lost time, frozen moments, time jumps, reversals.\nPETER: What about the apartment fire? How'd you categorize that one?\nOLIVIA: The spherical nature of it makes it distinct from the others.\nPETER: Maybe we should just go back to the site and get some more readings...\nWALTER: (leaves his office. headed to the refrigerator) Agent Dunham, I was going to make a boloney sandwich. (ignores Peter) Would you care for one?\nOLIVIA: No, but thank you, Walter. I'm working on the case with Peter. (trying to get the intemperate scientist engaged) We could really use you on this one.\nWALTER: I'd be happy to join you. (acting put upon) As soon as my lab is available to me again. Ah! My copy of Carroll's cosmology. (snags the reference book that Peter had been relying on for his equations) I was just looking for that.\nOLIVIA: (disappointed) Walter.\nPETER: It's okay. (ignoring the toddler temperament) Just let him go. (after Walter closes himself back in his office) He can't even look at me. (starting to worry)\nOLIVIA: Can you blame him? (negotiating) Seeing the adult version of the son that he lost. I mean, the visions he was having were unsettling enough.\nPETER: What visions?\nOLIVIA: For weeks before you arrived, you were appearing to him here in the lab. (genuine curiosity) You weren't aware you were doing that?\nPETER: No.\nOLIVIA: You were also showing up in my dreams. Almost every night. How is that possible when I'd never even seen you before?\nPETER: Olivia... look, you can believe whatever you like, but this is where I'm supposed to be. (convinced of the altruism) This is my home. So I don't know. Maybe you and Walter were seeing echoes of the other timeline.\nAGENT LEE: (enters the lab) Just got word. A freight train appeared out of nowhere, almost took out a car full of teenagers.\nOLIVIA: Are they okay?\nAGENT LEE: They're all fine. The car stopped just in time.\nOLIVIA: (grabs her jacket to leave) Let's take my car.\nPETER: I'll come with you guys. (heads to an equipment station to grab what he needs) If I'm causing some sort of cosmic disruption, then there's gonna be heightened levels of Alpha radiation, but I'm gonna need more specific readings. (follows across the lab to join them. gets halfway to the door, and in mid-sentence, walks into the railroad crossing environment they were headed to from the lab) The full spectrum of E-M waves, not just the...\n(Peter finds himself walking from Olivia's vehicle with the detection equipment he stopped to grab before they left. looking around the area, he orients himself, while the driver that was cut-off by the phantom train is interviewed)\nOLIVIA: (sidebar conversation in the background) And did you have a warning that the train might be coming?\nDYLAN: No, it... It just came out of nowhere. No bells or... or anything.\nOLIVIA: So when you say that the train disappeared, what do you mean exactly?\nDYLAN: I know it sounds crazy, but I could only see part of it, like it was passing through a window. Curved. Like looking through a bubble.\nAGENT LEE: Spherical.\nDYLAN: I swear, I wasn't smoking anything.\nAGENT LEE: (leaves the interview. to Peter) Something wrong?\nPETER: How did we get here?\nAGENT LEE: Um, we drove. You alright?\nPETER: No. No. I am not alright. I think I just had a time jump.\nAGENT LEE: (talks on phone while Olivia drives) You're sure about that? Okay, thanks. (to Olivia) The Transit Authority said that railroad line was decommissioned. The last train to run on that track was four years ago. Sound familiar?\nOLIVIA: The fire in the apartment building was four years ago.\nPETER: (upbeat) Well, that's finally a piece of good news. We might actually have the makings of a... (time jumps back to the remote railroad intersection) pattern.\nOLIVIA: (to Lee after they just arrive and exit the vehicle to start the interview) Boston PD held a witness for us. Let's hope he's got something useful.\nAGENT LEE: I'll check with the CSIs.\nPETER: (to himself about the time jump) This is gonna start getting annoying.\nOLIVIA: (starts her interview with the driver) Agent Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple questions.\nDYLAN: What do you want to know?\n(Peter starts scanning the driver's vehicle with his detector for anything out of the ordinary)\nOLIVIA: So you were with another two people? Who were they?\nDYLAN: Yeah, um, a girl in the front and a girl in the back.\n(readings at the front of the vehicle increase dramatically and Peter manually checks for structural integrity)\nOLIVIA: So when you say that the train disappeared, what did you mean exactly?\nDYLAN: Kind of like it was in brackets.\nOLIVIA: In brackets?\nDYLAN: Not like a bubble...\nOLIVIA: ...because...\nDYLAN: And then it was, uh, like looking through... so it was kind of... it was blurry.\nOLIVIA: Oh. Did you...\nPETER: (finds a fine white residue has formed on the front assembly of the car, taps it, hears a hollow sound, then snaps the end of the bumper like brittle candy) Hey, guys. I got something. (time jumps and makes that announcement in the car as they drive back to the Federal Building)\nAGENT LEE: (curious at the sudden announcement) What? (pauses and looks closer) Peter?\nPETER: (tones down the enthusiasm) There are heightened levels of neutron radiation at the train crossing.\nOLIVIA: Why didn't you tell us that when we were at the scene?\nPETER: Because I didn't know until I was just back there a second ago.\nOLIVIA: What? (alarmed)\nPETER: (dismissing the alarming aspect of the incident) It's not important. What is important is that a piece of the bumper just crumbled into my hands. Metal degradation... it's a classic sign of neutron radiation. We've got to get those kids tested for radiation poisoning.\nAGENT LEE: (not following the science) I'm sorry, you lost me.\nPETER: (professorial) It doesn't happen in nature. Cosmic radiation waves. They're random. Erratic. Neutron radiation has to be generated by human technology.\nOLIVIA: So what? You're saying you don't think you're responsible for what's going on?\nPETER: No. I'm not saying that. I don't know that. But what I am saying is that somebody has to be causing these time events.\n(the scientist in the Green household, has her academic work spread across the dining room table and excitedly adds to the equations she has been developing. her husband watches diligently from the kitchen)\nKATE GREEN: (stays eyes-down on her work. doting) Raymond, did you remember to change the date on your dentist appointment?\nRAYMOND GREEN: (checks the time remaining on his wristwatch) Yep. I remembered.\nKATE GREEN: And you took your cholesterol pill this morning?\nRAYMOND GREEN: (happy to be doted on) Like always, Kate. You know you don't need to remind me of things anymore. I've turned over a new leaf.\nKATE GREEN: Is that right? After thirty years?\nRAYMOND GREEN: What would I do without you? (replaces dull writing utensil) Here you go.\nKATE GREEN: Oh. Thank you, Honey.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (about the increased pace and anticipation) Success?\nKATE GREEN: No. Not yet, but close.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (lovingly supportive) I'm sure you'll get it, Honey. Any day now.\nKATE GREEN: Mm - hmm.\n(after the time remaining on his wristwatch expires. he walks to the kitchen. retrieves a service tray and joins Kate in the sitting room off of the other end of the kitchen)\nRAYMOND GREEN: Kate. (approaches the complacent, unfocused, love of his life as she rests quietly) Would you like some tea?\nKATE GREEN: (zero recognition) Who are you?\nRAYMOND GREEN: I'm Raymond, Sweetheart. I'm Raymond.\n(Doc Bishop sits stoically with his headset on and rocks out to a decades old 'hair band' singing about having too much time. across the lab, his lab, the intrusion continues as the 'new' Fringe team works through the science of the latest case)\nOLIVIA: Why would anyone develop technology that would cause time collisions?\nPETER: I don't know. Why would Oppenheimer invent The Bomb?\nOLIVIA: You think this is a weapon?\nPETER: No, no. I don't know that. I just... I mean, I hope not. But regardless the neutron pulse has to come from somewhere in the vicinity of these two time bubble events. (annotates the map) The fire and the train crossing. If we can find some kind of pattern, maybe we could locate the source.\nOLIVIA: But two points isn't really very much to go on.\nAGENT LEE: (gets off his cell phone at a workstation) How about four? I just got two new reports. Perfect circle of trees suddenly appeared in a parking garage in Chestnut Hill. (annotates the locations on the map) Shortly after, an open pit filled with rotting garbage suddenly appeared on the Eighth Hole of the Franklin Park Golf Course. The course was built on top of the landfill...\nOLIVIA: ...let me guess. Four years ago.\nPETER: Yeah, but look at it. It's still completely random to my eyes. There's no way to...\nWALTER: (abandons his headset of solitude, having had enough of watching limited minds try to solve such a pedantic issue) ...I am ready to present a theory. Snails! Nautilus shells. Ram's horns. These all have one thing in common. Fibonacci's Golden Spiral.\nPETER: I'll be damned, Walter. That's it.\nWALTER: (didactic tone) I believe the source of these time-slips must be located in the center of the spiral. You'll want to search a three square mile area in the vicinity of Brookline.\nKATE GREEN: (resting in her rocking chair. alacrity is better) We need to go Christmas shopping.\nRAYMOND GREEN: I know, Sweetheart. There's plenty of time. It's not even Thanksgiving yet.\nKATE GREEN: I'll miss it and then it'll be too late. I have to go. (anxious) All the stores will be closed...\nRAYMOND GREEN: Hey, hey, hey. We're not gonna miss Christmas. You hear me? I'm not gonna let that happen, okay? I'm not gonna let that happen. (calming. assuredly) Don't worry. We'll have all the Christmases in the world. I have some work I need to do now. But I will see you soon. (kisses her forehead. finds a large journal. retires to his basement and uploads equations from the journal in his computer. the electrical engineer finishes his inputs and throws the master switch on the large electrical array he has assembled beneath his wife's home. the capacitors charge and the digital master clock starts ticking down from forty-seven minutes. he walks back upstairs)\nKATE GREEN: (hard at work in the dining room with her astrophysics calculations) Raymond, did you remember to change the date for your dentist appointment?\nRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, I remembered.\nKATE GREEN: Oh, good. And you took your...\nRAYMOND GREEN: ...my cholesterol pills in the morning. Yeah, you don't need to remind me of every little thing.\nKATE GREEN: Oh, really? (lucid. focused. productive)\nRAYMOND GREEN: But I do enjoy it. (checks his wristwatch)\n(a swarm of law enforcers blanket the somewhat upscale neighborhood surrounding the coordinates that Walter pinpointed with Fibonacci logic)\nAGENT: (interview with bike rider) This is your house here, right, Ma'am? The gray one?\nOLIVIA: (to a local) If you do notice anything out of the ordinary, please contact the FBI.\nPETER: Thank you for your time.\nAGENT #1: (background chat) I'll check that house across the way, then.\nAGENT #2: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.\nOLIVIA: (walking to the next home) If the source is around here, then it must be well-hidden. Maybe it's underground.\nPETER: Or hiding in plain sight.\nOLIVIA: (stops at streets corner) Is something on your mind?\nPETER: Yeah. Yeah. Those dreams that you were having... the ones that I'm in...\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nPETER: Were we in a park? Walter on a swing set?\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: In the dreams, did you feel like you knew me? Did you feel anything?\nOLIVIA: You're a stranger, so... what would I feel? (nothing about Peter feels familiar or intuitive)\nAGENT: (background interview) Maintenance guy and the gardener.\nNEIGHBOR LADY: Yeah, alright. I'll just go ahead and talk to my neighbors.\nKATE GREEN: It's the red one, the one on differential equations.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (retrieves a reference book for his focused theoretician) Yeah. Got it! (police siren sounds in front of the home. checks the window and sees the police net)\nKATE GREEN: Raymond! (needs her reference book) Raymond! (no clue about the cops)\nRAYMOND GREEN: Kate! I need to show you something. (before the police get here)\nKATE GREEN: What is it? What's wrong?\nRAYMOND GREEN: I need to show you something.\nKATE GREEN: What are you talking about?\nRAYMOND GREEN: Just please! Come with me.\nKATE GREEN: Raymond, you're scaring me. (no clue about the police)\nRAYMOND GREEN: There's something you need to know. Something amazing.\nKATE GREEN: (follows him to the basement and sees that her home is filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of electrical gear) I don't understand. What is this?\nRAYMOND GREEN: I built it. From your work I used your theories, your concepts, your brilliance.\nKATE GREEN: (gets it) Raymond, are you saying...\nRAYMOND GREEN: Time Chambers are possible. Yes. I built it for you. Took me almost three years. It isn't perfect yet. It only works for limited periods. I got it up to forty-seven minutes now. But it can't go longer until I program it with the completed equation, Kate. Kate, listen to me. (serious) You need to complete it so we can keep the Chamber open indefinitely. (almost possessed)\nKATE GREEN: Raymond, what year is it? (understands the implications)\nRAYMOND GREEN: 2007. (in the house)\nKATE GREEN: No, what year is it out there? (beyond his time chamber)\nRAYMOND GREEN: 2011.\n(outside the Green home, police continue to comb the area and conduct interviews)\nAGENT #2: It's the next one over.\nAGENT: (approaches the front door of Raymond's house. walks through the perimeter of the time chamber maintained by Raymond, turns ashen, then painfully evaporates into the void) Aah! Aah!\nOLIVIA: (on cell phone to the lab) Okay, Walter, I'm as close as I'm gonna get.\nWALTER: Now you spray the fingerprint powder towards the suspect area.\nOLIVIA: (takes aerosol can and sprays several times. realizes the magnitude of the barrier) Walter, it's huge. There's no end to it.\nWALTER: Probably shrouds the entire property. This is a time bubble, and if we are right... and what's happening is originating from there... it would be powerful, which is why the agent was obliterated. You can't just walk from the present into the past. You're shattering the laws of physics.\nOLIVIA: Well, how do we get in?\nPETER: There's only one way in. We need a Faraday Cage. It's got to be mobile, something that can block out the electromagnetic field so that I can cross through and turn off whatever's causing this.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you need to build a moveable...\nWALTER: (snippy. to Olivia) I heard the idea! I know what a Faraday Cage is! A baboon would. (summons the help) Astrid! I need a computer battery. And a spool of copper wire. And a climbing harness. And some rubber cement. I think it's in my Spider-Man fanny-pack.\nOLIVIA: (curbside in Brookline) Walter's working on a way to get inside.\nBROYLES: Did he happen to mention when or where we can expect another residual event like the train or the apartment fire?\nOLIVIA: I didn't ask.\nAGENT LEE: What about Walter's spiral? It led us here to the origin. Could we use it to track where the next event will occur?\nPETER: Yeah, that's a good idea. I need a map.\nAGENT LEE: Come with me.\nKATE GREEN: (after seeing the commotion outside of her home) Raymond, you need to stop this. Turn it off!\nRAYMOND GREEN: No! You don't understand. You don't know what can happen. Look, we don't have much time. You need to finish the equation.\nKATE GREEN: (reluctant to comply) Tell me why this is happening. I don't understand why this is happening!\nRAYMOND GREEN: (negotiating) Trust me, Kate.\nKATE GREEN: Some things are supposed to remain theories. It wasn't meant to be built.\nRAYMOND GREEN: Listen to me.\nKATE GREEN: You don't understand what you've done! You don't understand! Tell me why you did this!\nRAYMOND GREEN: We don't have time!\nKATE GREEN: (calm after the spat) Raymond, why did you do this? Did something happen to me? Raymond?\nRAYMOND GREEN: (lovingly reluctant) I lost you, Kate. I lost you.\nBROYLES: (checking fresh data) We've identified the owners of the house. Raymond and Kate Green. Raymond is an electrical engineer, Kate, Professor Emeritus of Theoretical Physics at Boston University.\nOLIVIA: Theoretical physics? Well, that makes sense.\nBROYLES: She retired three years ago. Early onset Alzheimer's.\nAGENT LEE: We have a problem. (summons Olivia and Broyles to study the map)\nPETER: If we extend the Golden Spiral out to the next iteration, we find the next event's going to take place right there. The Melville Tunnel. (East of Somerville)\nAGENT LEE: Which didn't exist four years ago.\nOLIVIA: That tunnel goes under the river. There's hundreds of people in it at any one point. If that tunnel ceases to exist, they'll all drown.\nBROYLES: Agent Lee, get down there. Coordinate with Boston PD and start evacuating.\nASTRID: (approaches with container of equipment for access to the time bubble) Here. Walter calls this the Walter Bishop Faraday Harness. He wanted me to tell you that.\nPETER\/OLIVIA: (simultaneously) Okay, so how do I put it on?\nOLIVIA: I'm the one who goes in.\nPETER: And what are you gonna do when you get inside?\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna shut it off.\nPETER: How?\nOLIVIA: Walter will talk me through.\nPETER: (to Broyles) We don't even know if the comms are gonna work in there. We need someone with a science background.\nBROYLES: He's right.\nWALTER: (on videophone earpiece to Astrid) No, no, you... the primary transistor goes on the back of the neck with the prongs either side of the wearer's spine.\nASTRID: (paraphrases the message) This goes into your neck.\nPETER: Of course it does.\nWALTER: (disinterested in the outcome) I'm sure this will get him across but I'm not guaranteeing what will happen on the inside. Environment in the bubble may override the device.\nASTRID: (on earpiece) Walter, what happens if it breaks down on the inside?\nWALTER: Exactly the same as happened to the unfortunate fellow who turned into confetti.\nASTRID: (after Peter approaches, tests, then steps through the barrier) Walter, he's in.\nWALTER: (moderately impressed) The cage was a good idea. He's very smart.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (in the basement. rushing to get her to finish her brilliant work) We have to hurry.\nKATE GREEN: It's over, Raymond. They're outside.\nRAYMOND GREEN: No, they can't come in. It's impossible. All you have to do is solve the problem.\nKATE GREEN: (confessional) I already solved it. Upstairs it's, um... It's why I called out to you. I haven't written it down yet, but I have it.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (smacks Peter in the head after the device safely allows him to transit the home and find the time device in the basement) Yah!\nKATE GREEN: Raymond, what have you done?\nOLIVIA: Peter? Peter, can you hear me?\nASTRID: (takes cell phone call) Agent Lee.\nAGENT LEE: (hurries through the transit tunnel beneath the river with police support. cars are stopped and passengers are panicked) We've still got over fifty cars stuck down here. We're clearing out the civilians. You have to see this. (starts Sprint \u00ae Smartphone video imaging of the time anomaly. the barrier wall, 50 feet in front of him, shows cars and people trapped in the waters that flowed through the river years earlier)\nRAYMOND GREEN: (heated discussion in corner of basement. Peter comes too at bottom of stairs) You know, I thought this was impossible. But I wouldn't give up. It wouldn't work and then something changed.\nKATE GREEN: What changed?\nRAYMOND GREEN: At first, I couldn't get it to work. And then three days ago, I got results. And five minutes turned into ten, and ten into twenty, and then...I got it up to forty-seven minutes. I know it can go longer.\nKATE GREEN: It's over, Raymond. They're not going away.\nRAYMOND GREEN: We're not turning it off!\nPETER: (approaches with baseball bat) Don't make me hurt you.\nRAYMOND GREEN: No, no, no, don't! You can't. The entire city block will be evaporated along with all of us.\nKATE GREEN: He's right! If it's not shut down properly, it will cause a rip in the fabric of space-time.\nPETER: Then shut it down properly. An agent is already dead because of this machine, and right now, there's a tunnel out there that's gonna cease to exist causing who knows how many more deaths.\nRAYMOND GREEN: What are you talking about?\nKATE GREEN: (mentally reviews the body of her work) Time displacement. There are repercussions. Repercussions I was afraid of. (thinks) I'll shut it down.\nRAYMOND GREEN: No. Kate!\nKATE GREEN: On one condition. (to Peter) I want immunity for my husband. He didn't know. There's no way he could have.\n(heads upstairs and outside to the edge of the time chamber)\nPETER: (on tactical radios) Can you hear me?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, go ahead.\nPETER: They've agreed to turn it off, but they've got some conditions.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (tender moment in basement) I can't go on without you. I don't want this for us. Kate, when you got sick, it happened so fast. And all the things that you were for me and all the things that you did for me... I didn't have a chance to be that for you. I thought we'd have more time.\nKATE GREEN: (resigned. philos) This isn't living, Raymond. Living is what's beyond this room, beyond this house, out there in the world where you're supposed to be.\nRAYMOND GREEN: Then if not this, how? How do I repay you? I mean, what... what better thing can I do for you than this? You say that you shouldn't change fate, but you don't know. You don't know what's waiting for you, how terrible it is. Sweetheart, I'll never give up, Kate. Never. I'll build it again. I can do it again. We have your completed equation... you did it. Look, all you have to do is write it in that book. (points to the large journal he uses) I'm not going to give up. I'm not going to give up, Kate.\nKATE GREEN: We would have to move to... to another place.\nRAYMOND GREEN: (eager from her advice) Yes. Far away, yes. And I'm sure you'll find a way so that people won't get hurt. Let 'em have their investigation. (nurturing) Let 'em take away all the equipment, ask their questions. I'll build it again. (kisses her forehead) I'll build it again. (as his wife gets busy filling his journal with her final solution)\nAGENT LEE: (as the water begins to breach into the remaining dry spaces in Melville tunnel) Everybody, run! Everybody, run now! Get outta here!\nPETER: (returning to the basement) Alright, they're drawing up the paperwork, but I have assurances, you will not be prosecuted. (waits while they hold hands and kiss) Hey, I hate to break this up, but I held up my end of the deal and we're running out of time.\nKATE GREEN: (looks at the closed journal she left for her husband) I love you, Raymond.\nRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah. (turns a few dials, studies his wife's eyes and throws the master switch to OFF. the capacitors dissipate and the time chamber ceases. Kate disappears with it)\nAGENT LEE: Run! (as tons of water rush along the subterranean road toward the fleeing commuters. stops and turns around when the water disappears along with the time chamber)\nRAYMOND GREEN: (talking softly as his ailing wife sits in her rocking chair) Alright. Don't... don't. Don't worry about all these people here, Kate. It's okay. It'll be just us again. I have to go answer some questions now.\nKATE GREEN: Okay.\nRAYMOND GREEN: A few hours and I'll be back. A nurse will be here with you in case you need anything. Alright? (kisses her forehead and walks to a chest of drawers) I'll be back soon. (surreptitiously removes Kate's notebook. checks to see how she finished the 'time chamber' equation) No. (flips through the pages and finds the entire formula has been redacted) No. No. (finds a message that she loves him and that he should live his life)\nPETER: (exiting the elevator) I know, I know. Stay here.\nOLIVIA: I just need a few minutes. If you get hungry you can get a snack from the kitchen, which is just there.\nPETER: Yeah.\nAGENT: (to Olivia after she steps away) Fire Marshal says they've never seen anything like it.\nBROYLES: Good work today. Turns out it wasn't you causing these events after all.\nPETER: Actually, I think it was. I think the only reason Kate's theory worked is because of my presence here.\nBROYLES: Why do you think that?\nPETER: Because I overheard Raymond telling Kate that he only started getting results three days ago. I arrived three days ago. Initially I thought it was the timeline that had to be reset, but... now I'm thinking that it's me. Clearly, I'm in the wrong place. And all the people that I know and love are somewhere else. Now I just gotta figure out how to get home.\nBROYLES: In the meantime, I can make it more comfortable while you're here. In your debriefing, you said you were living in faculty housing with Doctor Bishop. I checked. Doctor Bishop does own a home on campus.\nPETER: (after walking through the front door. removes a dust furniture cover) It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nOLIVIA: Just so you know, there'll be an FBI agent stationed out the front door.\nPETER: Where would I run to? So hey, do I get an allowance?\nOLIVIA: I'll see what I can do.\nPETER: Okay. Thanks for the lift.\nOLIVIA: I'm gonna talk to Walter again and see if I can convince him to help you.\nPETER: Best of luck with that.\nOLIVIA: (thinks for a second) I was important to you, wasn't I? I mean, the other version of me... 'cause I see the way you look at me when you think that I'm not aware.\nPETER: Yeah. Yeah, she was. She is.\nOLIVIA: Well, I hope that you get back to her.\nPETER: Thank you. Me too. (as she leaves the house)"

Olivia heads to the pharmacy for a refill)\nOLIVIA: Uh, I called in a prescription just a little while ago.\nPHARMACIST: Olivia Dunham?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nPHARMACIST: (hands-over the drugs) This is your last refill so have your doctor call in a new prescription for next time.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I was hoping I wouldn't need these anymore.\nPHARMACIST: Thanks. Have a good night.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. (walking home in the wee hours of the morning, she spots her colleague in a quiet diner and joins him)\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nAGENT LEE: Hey. This is bizarre.\nOLIVIA: Well, I just, uh -- I was on my way home, and I only live a few blocks from here.\nAGENT LEE: I didn't know that. So you're just heading home now?\nOLIVIA: Well, from a walk. I had a migraine. And you know, fresh air helps. You?\nAGENT LEE: Well, as far as twenty-four hour dining goes, this place is better than most. In fact, they make a pretty good cup of coffee if you want to join me.\nOLIVIA: (after finding a booth to share) You haven't slept in how long?\nAGENT LEE: Since I got here.\nOLIVIA: That's a long time.\nAGENT LEE: It's hard... adjusting to a new city.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I can imagine.\nAGENT LEE: You remember a couple weeks ago you asked me if I was...\nOLIVIA: ... Freaked out?\nAGENT LEE: (serious tone) I used to believe just a few months ago that, uh, I understood the world we lived in. I mean, there were basic truths that I thought were... well...true. I used to sleep like a baby. Blissful ignorance.\nOLIVIA: You know, eventually it will just become your life.\nAGENT LEE: Is that what happened with you?\nOLIVIA: (thinks) Yeah. Uh, sort of.\nJACK ZOEPHEL: (walking through the residential back alleys late at night. answers cell phone) Hey.\nMEG ZOEPHEL: (calling from home) Hi, babe. Are you close?\nJACK ZOEPHEL: Yeah, sorry. I'm almost there. I took the shortcut behind the theater.\nMEG ZOEPHEL: Alright. You okay?\nJACK ZOEPHEL: Ugh, no. I feel like I'm being followed.\nMEG ZOEPHEL: What? By who?\nJACK ZOEPHEL: I don't know! I don't know. I'm sure it's just my imagination.\nMEG ZOEPHEL: Where are you? I'm calling the Police.\nJACK ZOEPHEL: No, Meg, it's fine! I'm two blocks away from Willow. (approaches the lobby of his building. answers his cell phone) Hello? Meg?\nMEG ZOEPHEL: (from upstairs) Cops are on their way.\nJACK ZOEPHEL: No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm here. I'm ho-- (tackled from behind)\nOFFICER GRANT: (after parking squad car and rushing to the lobby) This is Grant. I need an ambulance at 1625 Willow.\nDISPATCH: Ten-Four. Copy location.\nOFFICER #2: Dear God, what happened to this guy? Is he alive?\nOFFICER GRANT: What the hell was that? (fires at an invisible entity the rushes past him)\nOFFICER #2: What? What are you shooting at?\nOFFICER GRANT: I don't know.\nMEG ZOEPHEL: (rushes into the lobby) Jack!\nOFFICER GRANT: Freeze! Ma'am! Ma'am, stay back.\nMEG ZOEPHEL: Jack! He's my husband!\nOFFICER GRANT: Ma'am stay back!\nMEG ZOEPHEL: (screams at the discovery) Jack! Let me go! (wanting to tend to her husband)\nPETER: (walking the aisles with a shopping cart and an armed escort) You've got to love this assignment, right Tim? I mean, where else can you find baked goods, car parts, and video games all under the same roof?\nAGENT TIM: Yes, sir.\nPETER: Sir? I'm moving up in the world. Did Broyles tell you to call me that? Keep that level of formality. That way, you don't get attached to your prisoner.\nAGENT TIM: You're not my prisoner.\nPETER: So what, then you're my bodyguard?\nAGENT TIM: Maybe just imagine I'm a friend.\nPETER: Yeah, 'cause every thirty-two year-old man needs a friend to chaperone him while he's underwear shopping.\nAGENT TIM: You know what, that reminds me, uh -- Agent Broyles told me to tell you that he has authorized you a two hundred dollar week allowance.\nPETER: Two hundred dollars? (sarcastic) Big spender. The only other thing I need is safety glasses. You see 'em?\nAGENT TIM: Nope.\nPETER: Here we go. (offering to help a boy get an item from a high shelf) Here, let me give you a hand.\nAGENT TIM: (after stopping Peter with a firm hand to the chest) I'll get it.\nYOUNG SHOPPER: Thanks.\nPETER: (peeved) What was that about?\nAGENT TIM: Nothing. Just figured I'd help.\nPETER: You really think I'd hurt a kid?\nAGENT TIM: I've been instructed to limit your interaction with civilians. It's not personal.\nPETER: (disgruntled) You know, I've been investigating Fringe Events for three years -- I never thought I'd become one.\nAGENT TIM: (rolls his eyes at the melodrama) Like I said, it's not personal.\nBROYLES: (briefs his science team as they enter the Beacon Hill murder scene from earlier that morning) Victim's name is Jack Zoephel. At approximately Three-thirty A.M., his wife placed a call to 9-1-1. He believed he was being followed home. His wife was on the phone with Jack when he was attacked. The police arrived less than two minutes after the call was placed. When they got here, he was already dead.\nAGENT LEE: (studies the pale, white-haired corpse in the lobby) I'm assuming he didn't look like this before he left for the night?\nBROYLES: No.\nASTRID: Walter's going to love this.\nOLIVIA: (looks at the lobby entrance) What's with all the broken glass?\nBROYLES: That uniformed officer believed he was shooting the perpetrator.\nOLIVIA: (begins interview in the courtyard) So he can identify the guy?\nBROYLES: Not exactly.\nOLIVIA: So you shot at nothing.\nOFFICER GRANT: I was just spooked, is all.\nAGENT LEE: You unloaded your entire clip.\nOFFICER GRANT: I don't know what to tell you. I overreacted.\nAGENT LEE: I'm willing to bet that you don't want to risk telling us what happened because you're concerned about your reputation. You don't need to be. Whatever you saw, however bizarre it is, we need to know what it was.\nOFFICER GRANT: (hesitant) I don't even know how I'm going to begin to file a report for this case.\nOLIVIA: (reassuring) Well, we'll take care of that if you just tell us what you saw.\nOFFICER GRANT: I didn't see anything, exactly. But I -- I felt something.\nAGENT LEE: Like what? A ghost?\nOFFICER GRANT: (intimidated by the term) You said ghost, not me.\nASTRID: (begins preliminary inspection with videophone link to the lab) His neck is broken.\nWALTER: (mush-mouthed) Could have happened post-mortem. Cause of death could be duet to rapid...\nASTRID: Walter, I can't understand you, wha-- are you eating?\nWALTER: (sitting at his monitor bank in the lab. gorging on snack) Onion rings from Sully's. Double-dipped in beer batter. Fantastic. He could have died from a rapid spike of adrenaline associated with fear. That could be why he is white as a sheet.\nASTRID: What? Are you saying that he was scared to death? Walter, that's just an old wives tale.\nWALTER: Where's your imagination? (rudely) You must have been a very boring child.\nASTRID: I'm ignoring that. (disconnects earpiece video cam)\n(Agent Lee visually inspects the landing in front of the lobby for evidence. Olivia checks-in with Astrid)\nOLIVIA: Did Walter have any theories?\nASTRID: Uh, a few. But until he runs some tests, he's not gonna know anything for sure.\nOLIVIA: (sidebar thought) Can I ask you something? All the things that we see... like this... does it ever get to you?\nASTRID: (candidly) Yes. Every day. If I wasn't seeing the agency shrink, my head would have exploded a long time ago. It's not like I can talk to family or friends. I mean... Well, who do you talk to?\nOLIVIA: No one. I'm starting to think that that's weird. That's just not normal, is it?\nAGENT LEE: (enters the lobby with an evidence bag) We can rule out ghosts.\nOLIVIA: What makes you say that?\nAGENT LEE: Ghosts don't bleed. (holds-up bag)\n(a dank storage room with small personal items clutter simple wooden shelves. tables full of lab equipment heat two large vessels connected to a large vat. a fully immersed young man sits-up in the milky mixture and quivers from the treatment he just administered. later, wearing a suit and tie, he locates the residential elevator he rides for his silent morning ritual)\nNED RYERSON: (joins his fellow residents in the elevator) Hi. How's the morning treating you?\nJULIE: (polite familiarity) Pretty good, and yourself?\nNED RYERSON: Not too bad. Glad the hot weather's starting to turn.\nJULIE: Me too. Fall's my favorite. I love how the leaves change colors.\nNED RYERSON: After you. So, do you have big plans for the weekend?\n(the morning ritual ends when Julie and Ned leave the elevator without having said a word to him)\nOLIVIA: (as the science team starts to work on the Zoephel autopsy) There have been three bodies similar to this one found in the surrounding area over the past two weeks. And why is this the first we're hearing of it?\nASTRID: Before they ran the medical records, the police just assumed that all the victims were suffering from albinism. It's more common than people think.\nOLIVIA: I guess. Any luck?\nASTRID: (scans her monitor) Well, so far, I've checked law enforcement databases, including Interpol, but it's possible that this person's DNA is not in any criminal database.\nOLIVIA: What about hospitals?\nASTRID: That's my next move.\nWALTER: (tutoring Lee over the corpse) We call them albinos, but the Kishwahili Tribe from Tanzania called them \"Zeru\" - which is also the word for 'ghosts'. Witch doctors from there sometimes used body parts from albinos In potions for good luck or fortune.\nAGENT LEE: That's...\nWALTER: Grisly? (takes sample to microscope station)\nAGENT LEE: Yeah, I'd say that.\nOLIVIA: (approaches) You found something?\nWALTER: Yeah. There's a mucous-like substance on the body, a residue.\nOLIVIA: From something in particular?\nWALTER: Uh-huh. They're chromatophore cells. You find them in octopi, chameleons. Cells that have the ability to translocate pigment in the body. It's what certain creatures use to blend into their backgrounds.\nASTRID: (from her workstation) I just got a positive I.D. on the blood sample.\nOLIVIA: Do we have a name?\nASTRID: Uh-huh. Baby Boy Bryant. According to this, the blood sample we found at the crime scene belonged to a baby born on July 26, 1989, at Parkview Hospital in New York. And he died four days later -- July 30, 1989.\nWALTER: Well, that's quite a quandary. (foreboding) Perhaps we're looking for a ghost after all.\nAGENT LEE: (rummaging through the records repository) They started automating their records twenty years ago. Here it is. \"Baby Boy Bryant.. Born 26 July, 1989.\"\nOLIVIA: Gosh, they didn't even give him a proper name.\nAGENT LEE: Infant born with an unclassified genetic variant. Over ten specialists examined him. No one could diagnose him. No medical precedent found. You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I just started to get another migraine. I can do it.\nAGENT LEE: I know you can, but you don't need to. (opens prescription bottle)\nOLIVIA: Thanks.\nAGENT LEE: I'll get you some water. So this baby was a mystery.\nOLIVIA: Says he died from complications of his genetic abnormality on the 30th of July, 1989.\nAGENT LEE: (returns with water) Which we already knew.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. Okay, Doctor Blake West and Teresa Jaffee, RN. See, I wonder if either of them are still working here.\n(after locating the attending nurse, the trio settles in the cafeteria for an interview)\nAGENT LEE: Ms Jaffee, is this your signature on the death certificate?\nTERESA JAFFEE: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Can you tell us what you remember about Baby Boy Bryant?\nTERESA JAFFEE: I was in the delivery room when he was born. He was so...pale. When Doctor West held him up, the lights in the O.R. burned his skin. We had to put him in a special ward with no windows and no lights. So when Doctor West told me that the baby had died, I was relieved that he wasn't suffering anymore. (thinks back twenty+ years)\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nTERESA JAFFEE: I've never told anyone this. As they carried him out... I thought I heard him cry. It was faint. But I thought I heard him. I assumed I had imagined it.\nAGENT LEE: Do you remember where he was taken to?\nTERESA JAFFEE: It was a private insurance company. Um, something like... Cilas or... Cypro, uh...\nOLIVIA: Cyprox?\nTERESA JAFFEE: Yes. That's it. Cyprox, Incorporated. I was told they'd be handling the autopsy.\nOLIVIA: Thank you so much for your help.\nAGENT LEE: (leaving after the interview) Okay. How'd you know Cyprox?\nOLIVIA: Because they paid my mother's medical bills while she was dying of cancer. And Cyprox was a subsidiary of a larger company called Kelvin Genetics.\nAGENT LEE: Why do I have a bad feeling about this?\nOLIVIA: Because Kelvin Genetics became Massive Dynamic.\nNINA: (looks at the file in her hand) \"Cyprox, Inc.\" It's been years since I heard that name.\nOLIVIA: We have reason to believe that Cyprox, Inc. abducted an infant from a hospital twenty-two years ago.\nNINA: I'm afraid your suspicions are true.\nAGENT LEE: What can you tell us about him?\nNINA: The boy had an unidentified genetic abnormality. He would have died within a matter of days. But this same genetic deformity made him suitable for some... genetic experimentation.\nOLIVIA: Walter discovered specific animal cells on the body that we found.\nNINA: Chromatophores. The nature of the boy's cellular abnormality allowed those cells to be implanted into his system, making him able to blend into his surroundings.\nAGENT LEE: Making him a perfect spy or soldier.\nNINA: Well, there were military applications, yes. Unexpectedly, the experiment also allowed this child to survive. Something about the chromatophores offset his very fragile condition.\nOLIVIA: And you knew about this?\nNINA: No. This was a satellite research facility, one of dozens. Neither Doctor Bell nor I had any specific knowledge of what was going on. Now, I\u2019m not trying to justify what was done. I'm just saying that this child would have died had he not been part of that program.\nOLIVIA: Maybe that would have been better.\nNINA: I think I'll send the boy's files over to Walter's lab, maybe there's something in them that can help.\nAGENT LEE: If you didn't know about him, how are you so familiar with all this?\nNINA: There was a fire in the lab ten years ago. And we assumed that all the subjects had died in that fire. That was the first time that William and I ever learned of Eugene.\nAGENT LEE: Eugene?\nNINA: Well, that's what the researchers called him. \u2018U-Gene\u2019. Short for \"Unknown GENEtic disorder.\"\nOLIVIA: His entire life, he didn't have a proper name.\nNINA: We assumed that he'd died. And, as you can imagine, it was impossible to prove. (sufficiently humble) So... now it seems as if we were wrong.\n(Julie returns to her fifteenth floor apartment at the end of the day. as she enters, a transparent entity slips through the door behind her. after kicking-off her shoes, she heads to the kitchen, pours herself a glass of wine and lets down her hair. after turning on some music and losing her jacket...)\nJULIE: Ziggy? Ziggy? Here, Kitty-kitty. Ziggy? Where are you?\n(the transparent entity avoids detection after leaving the bedroom and slips into the kitchen to examine the stylish hairpin left on the counter. searching for her cat, Julie finds her bed covered in leaves. she drops her wine glass at the discovery and grows alarmed when she hears the front door unlatch. concerned for her safety, she secures the still moving chain on her door and locks-up)\nPETER: (after posting blueprints and schematics on walls, a visitor knocks and enters) Hey.\nAGENT LEE: Hey.\nPETER: Come in.\nAGENT LEE: Sorry it took Broyles so long to sign off on this stuff. (puts a box on needed items on the table)\nPETER: I was starting to get worried.\nAGENT LEE: For all your help the other day, I'm surprised he didn't give you a badge. (half-jokingly)\nPETER: (earnest) Thank you.\nAGENT LEE: (matter-of-factly) That's my job.\nPETER: No, no, I mean... thank you for treating me like a human being. I haven't been getting that a lot lately. I appreciate it.\nAGENT LEE: So you really think it'll get you back to where you came from?\nPETER: The machine was powerful enough to snap me out of my timeline. Stands to reason that it's powerful enough to snap me back in.\nAGENT LEE: I suppose that makes sense.\nPETER: I hope so. My best chance of getting back home.\nAGENT LEE: Alt universes, different timelines. Olivia says that, eventually, all of this is going to seem run of the mill. Which, frankly, I'm having a hard time believing. It's insane how none of this phases her.\nPETER: She's made quite an impression on you, huh?\nAGENT LEE: I've never met anyone like her before.\nPETER: (chuckles knowingly) Yeah, I know what you mean.\nAGENT LEE: (friendly inquiry) You were together, weren't you? You and Olivia. Uh, back where you came from.\nPETER: Yeah, we are.\nAGENT LEE: Uh, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry. I didn't mean to-- no, no, no.\nPETER: It's okay. (more serious now) The Olivia you're talking about... that's not my Olivia.\nAGENT LEE: (answers cell phone) This is Agent Lee. I'll be right there. I need to go. Walter has something to show us.\nPETER: No problem. See you later. (get's busy on his project)\nWALTER: (after adding a device to the overhead lighting. to the returning field agents) Oh, good, you're here. I want to show you something.\nAGENT LEE: (approaches a new aquarium) Is that an octopus?\nWALTER: (excited) Charming, isn't she? Brilliant, creative creatures. You know, they actually do build gardens. And colored rocks and plants and shells, and even garbage. They arrange them around their caves. And they're like chameleons.\nASTRID: (returning from the private offices) Hey, why did we just get a bill for $818... you know I\u2019m gonna be the one to take the blame for this.\nWALTER: (blustery demand) Tell Agent Broyles that... science has no price tag!\nASTRID: (to Walter) I'm sure he'll be very pleased to hear that. (to Olivia) Uh, Nina sent over some files for you.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nWALTER: Eugene. Fascinating story.\nOLIVIA: Walter, do you think that Eugene is trying to make himself visible? That he's killing people in order to steal their pigment?\nAGENT LEE: Is that even possible?\nWALTER: It's possible, of course. Leprechauns are possible. (more thoughtful) That would explain the mucous on the victim's body. I didn't understand what it was, but it must be acting as some kind of conductor. And that's how Eugene's chromatophores are absorbing the victim's pigment. To overcome what's been done to him would require a considerable amount of pigment.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you're saying that if I\u2019m right --\nWALTER: (downbeat) Yes. I'm afraid you'll be finding a lot more victims.\n(on the second level of the parking garage, Ned Ryerson gets in to his vehicle and prepares to drive off. the transparent entity smashes the window, reaches inside, slams Ned against the steering wheel several times and fatally chokes him)\nWALTER: (sitting in front of a large wooden maze. calls to the inner offices) Everyone, come quickly! I have two pieces of news. First, he's dying.\nOLIVIA: Who's dying, Walter?\nWALTER: Our suspect. The Chameleon Man. (puts a white mouse in the maze) I've spent the last few hours recreating what we believe our young man is doing to himself, and, assuming you're right, Olivia, and he's trying to re-pigmentize himself, then... (wanders mentally) is that a word, 're-pigmentize'?\nOLIVIA: Well, go on, Walter. What is he trying to do to himself?\nWALTER: Well, the condition he was born with was killing him. If he is now attempting to reverse what was done to him, to make himself normal... or what was normal to him... then he is, in fact, committing suicide.\nASTRID: So you're saying he's poisoning himself?\nWALTER: In a sense, yes. His body's reverting to the deadly condition that he came into the world with. (reaches across the maze and retrieves the mouse at the end-point) Although... he may not be aware of it.\nOLIVIA: Well, how long until he dies?\nWALTER: Oh, don't worry. (confusing the mouse with the suspect) John here will be fine.\nAGENT LEE: Uh, I don't think Olivia meant the mouse.\nWALTER: The human? Well, I can't say. I suppose it depends on how successful he is. (phone rings back in the office and Astrid responds)\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, that doesn't change anything. We still have to find him.\nAGENT LEE: Well, how do we find something we can't see?\nWALTER: That was the second thing I had to tell you. (claps his hands and the overhead lighting dims) Ultraviolet light. (runs a UV wand over the maze) Come on, Yoko, where are you? (highlights a second, previously unseen, mouse)\nAGENT LEE: She's been there the whole time?\nASTRID: (returns from the phone call) That was Broyles. They found another body.\n(the investigators walk through the parking structure toward the corpse as search dogs are given the scent they need to locate the suspect)\nDOORMAN: I was just starting my shift when I saw the body. I didn't know what it was at first, all pale and white. It took me a while to see it was Mister Ryerson.\nBROYLES: Are the surveillance cameras functional?\nDOORMAN: Yeah, just installed a few weeks ago. There's been some break-ins recently.\nOLIVIA: And you say that nobody left the building? There's an emergency alarm on the back door, and you were at the front door the whole time? You never walked away, not even to go to the bathroom?\nDOORMAN: No, and I watched the security footage again, just to make certain.\nOLIVIA: This is going to sound odd. Even though you didn't see anyone, did any of the exterior doors open on their own?\nDOORMAN: What are you looking for? (a search dog hits on the scent at a nearby access door and barks aggressively)\nCANINE HANDLER: Lieutenant Broyles, the dog has got the scent!\nOLIVIA: Where does that door lead?\nDOORMAN: To the upper levels!\nOLIVIA: Are there any building exits on the floors?\nDOORMAN: No!\nOLIVIA: Sir, he could still be up there.\nBROYLES: Lock this place down. (as Lee and Dunham start through the door) I need every available unit to the Elmwood Apartments.\nAGENT: (approaches with news of the lockdown) Lieutenant Broyles... last floor's evacuating.\nBROYLES: Have they been instructed to leave their doors open?\nAGENT: Mm-hmm.\nBROYLES: Okay, shut it down.\nBROYLES: Everything but the elevators.\nAGENT: (on command radio) Shut down as planned. Over.\nCOMMAND POST: (reply transmission) Code Four.\n(canine units converge in the darkened building with Dunham and Lee)\nAGENT SPENCER: My men are ready.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (to Spencer) You take your team down and clear the parking garage and the basement. (to Lee) I'm gonna take one dog team up to the highest floor, work our way down. You start here. We'll meet in the middle.\nAGENT LEE: (to canine led tactical unit) Okay. You guys come with me. We'll take the North Stairwell.\nOLIVIA: (after several floors into a top-down search. to her team) This is taking too long. Let's split up. (takes access door to area under renovation)\nAGENT SPENCER: Go.\nOLIVIA: I'll take this floor.\nAGENT SPENCER: Let's make sure he copies it. (moving down the stairwell with the search dogs team) We've got a scent. Right there, right there. Yeah. Just a couple more.\nOLIVIA: Uhh! (falls into large hole in floor)\nAGENT LEE: (tactical radio call) Olivia, do you read?\nOLIVIA: Uhh!\nAGENT SPENCER: False lead. It's just a shirt.\nAGENT LEE: (on tactical radio) Olivia, can you read me? Olivia? Come in!\nOLIVIA: (struggling not to fall as Eugene approaches in her UV light) Help me, please.\nEUGENE BRYANT: (condescendingly authoritative) You understand right now how important it is to be seen. Your life depends on it. Me seeing you right now. (grabs her and pulls her to safety. snags her pistol from the holster and aims it at her)\nOLIVIA: Okay, just wait. Listen, you're dying. (negotiating honestly) Whatever it is that you're doing to yourself, it's killing you. Just -- please let us -- let us try and heal you.\nEUGENE BRYANT: (jaded and bitter) I don't think you're here to help me heal. Not after what I\u2019ve done. If you're here to help me, it's because I have value to the military, And they don't want the long-lostExperiment 69545 to self-destruct! Not when they found him again.\nOLIVIA: We have nothing to do with the military. I am just here to stop the killing.\nEUGENE BRYANT: (bittersweet) All my life... I've been watching them live theirs. Watching them... fall in love. To be looked upon by the right person... to connect... and to see in their eyes kindness. (longingly) Happiness. And... recognition. (altruistic) That's when you exist.\nAGENT LEE: (radio call) Liv! Please respond! Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: There is a scientist who I work with for the FBI. He works out of a Harvard lab. Now, if anyone can hope to undo what they've done to you --\nEUGENE BRYANT: I lived my life in a lab! I am not going back!\nOLIVIA: (earnest assessment) If you treat yourself again, even once, it could kill you.\nAGENT LEE: (approaching with canine team just after the suspect flees) Olivia! Where are you? Olivia! She's in here!\nOLIVIA: (as the dogs approach. to Lincoln) He's got my gun. (follows the team as they follow the scent. Olivia finds her pistol. radio call) Spencer, come in.\nAGENT SPENCER: (approaches the waiting Agent outside the main lobby) Agent Broyles. We've got nothing.\nOLIVIA: (joins the conversation) And the dogs have been through every floor twice. He's gone.\nBROYLES: (looks at the increasingly disturbed mob) Let's get these people into their homes.\nAGENT: Let 'em in!\n(the science team watches the crowd as they stream in. the dogs pick-up the scent again as Bryant quietly slips away through the crowd. nobody on the science team can visually detect what the dogs are telling them)\nAGENT SPENCER: (radio call) Sir.\nBROYLES: Go ahead.\nAGENT SPENCER: (radio call) You're gonna want to see this. (after the science team joins him in the basement) There's a sub-basement where all the pipes run. It's designed as a service bay.\nOLIVIA: (looks at the stolen trinkets) This is his home.\nAGENT LEE: These items must belong to all the residents.\nOLIVIA: It looked like he kept a small token from each person's life. He was watching them.\nAGENT LEE: It looks like you were right. (examines the lab equipment) He was trying to cure himself.\nOLIVIA: This isn't about curing himself. (studies a heart locket) This is about being seen.\nJULIE: (as the elevator nearly departs the 14th Floor. Bryant grabs the door and enters) I thought you weren't coming today. I see you every day. I - I thought you might have caught the cold that's been going around.\nEUGENE BRYANT: (stunned at the sudden social interaction) No.\nJULIE: Well, that's good, then. It's too beautiful a day to be sick.\nEUGENE BRYANT: The most beautiful. (studies his elegant acquaintance) My name is Eugene.\nJULIE: (polite eye-contact. farm girl smile) I'm Julie.\n(after she exits the elevator, Bryant sits down against the door and quietly dies)\nOLIVIA: (joins her mentor in the Massive Dynamic office inside the compound) I thought you should know that we found Eugene Bryant's body. So it's over.\nNINA: Well, thank you. You could have called to tell me.\nOLIVIA: All he wanted was to be like... everyone else. But how could he? He'd never be like anyone else. Not after what they did to him.\nNINA: So you're thinking about what was done to you.\nOLIVIA: You know, even with my colleagues, I'm different. Things that should bother me.... Do you think that it's possible the Cortexiphan Trials stunted my emotions?\nNINA: Oh, Olive, you can't let what happened to you as a child define you. And no -- the answer to your question is you are perfectly normal. (stands) At least as normal as any of us is normal. Life is an experiment. You have to find out where you belong, find your own place in this world.\nOLIVIA: But shouldn't I know where that is by now?\nNINA: Not necessarily. I mean, before you and your sister came to live with me, my life was work. And I didn't think that I could find the time or the room for you girls in my life. Now, I can't imagine what my life would have been like if I hadn't taken that risk. Now, when the time is right, you'll know. (supportive smile and nod)\nPETER: (plops a gift on the table) Hey.\nAGENT LEE: Hey. What's this? (opens spectacle case)\nPETER: I got you something. Just trust me. (leaving the area) I'm going to get going. Broyles is letting me use the lab. (passing Olivia as heads toward the Situation Room and Lee) Hey.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) Hey. (approaching Lee's workstation) Is that our paperwork?\nAGENT LEE: Yep... just finished. (hands her the thick file)\nOLIVIA: Thank you. Guess we can put this case on the list of things that makes it hard for you to sleep.\nAGENT LEE: That list is getting longer.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe if you find yourself, uh, at the diner tonight, say, around Three A.M., I might, uh, I might see you there.\nAGENT LEE: I'll see you then. Maybe. (polite nods by both as she leaves the area. he puts on his new glasses and checks them out in the monitor reflection)\n(a little after three in the morning, Lee sits and solves his crossword puzzle next with a fresh coffee refill. a quick check of the door makes it seem like Olivia might not make it there. in her apartment, Olivia prepares to step-out to the diner for a little while. a noxious gas seeps under her front door and she falls to the floor incapacitated. two men enter her apartment wearing gas masks)\nFIRST INTRUDER: Clear. (removing masks) Should we move her to the bed?\nLELAND SPIVEY: (after disabling the security monitor and injecting Cortexiphan in the base of Olivia's skull) No need. She's not gonna remember the last two hours, anyway. When she wakes up, she's gonna have one hell of a headache. (closes his briefcase full of Cortexiphan vials and leaves the apartment. passes \"Nina Sharp\" while she waits)"

So instead...\nPETER: You're talking to me? I don't understand.\nWALTER: (holds plate of food up to smell) Chocolate chip and banana pancakes. What could be clearer? Sit. (Peter sits)\nOLIVIA: (slips up behind Peter) Good morning. (then around front for a kiss) Good morning, Walter. (a kiss for him too) I thought you were making waffles.\nPETER: The waffle iron is broken.\nOLIVIA: Oh, but you were so looking forward to them. (returns to the table and sits)\nPETER: It's okay. This is fine. (genuinely delighted) Being back, with the two of you... this is very, very fine.\nWALTER: Don't worry, son. I'll get this infernal machine working. (holding the waffle iron) Then we can have waffles every day. I just need to adjust... (drops the waffle iron on the floor)\nPETER: (the loud thud of the appliance hitting the floor rousts Peter from the catnap he was having at his desk) Walter. (gets up and leaves)\nWALTER: (after blowing air across several small pinwheels mounted before him) It's incredible. Astrid, come quickly. You've got to see this. The pinwheel with the metallic qualities is spinning against the flow of air, completely violating the law of physics. (as a large box is set on the table) Oh... pastries-- how nice. Thank you, Astrid. (steps back, intimidated when he sees he is not talking to Astrid)\nPETER: Hello, Walter. I have to talk to you about the machine. Walter... the machine was powerful enough to pop me out of my timeline. And I think it's the only thing that can get me back to where I belong. You built the thing. You're the only person who can help me reconfigure its matrix.\nWALTER: That machine is staggeringly dangerous. It's capable of destroying universes.\nPETER: I know. And maybe I am, too. I have tried to respect your boundaries. I have stayed away, Walter. But I\u2019ve got to get home now. And you're the only person who can help me do that. (sternly) I have been separated from my family. And you of all people should understand how desperate I am to get back.\nWALTER: (sits and remembers a terrible day) The water was still running in the sink. She must've come to her decision while she was washing the dishes.\nPETER: What?\nWALTER: I knew almost immediately... even before I found the body. The car's engine was still running. There was no note. (somber) There didn't need to be. We had just lost our only child. I should have mourned with her... been there. But instead I let her grieve alone so that I could focus on finding a way to the alternate universe to save someone else's child. My actions caused the death of my wife... unspeakable damage to two universes. I lost my career... and my sanity... all because I tried to help another Peter. (ominous) I may be the only man that can help you, but I\u2019m also the only man that cannot help you.\nPETER: (after knocking) Your office told me you were on leave. You okay?\nOLIVIA: Uh, yeah, it's -- it's just a migraine -- I think exhaustion. Broyles told me to take the day, rest up. What are you doing here?\nPETER: I need to ask you a favor. You mind if I come in?\nOLIVIA: Uh, sure. Please. (closes door, sits in living room)\nPETER: I need you to ask Broyles to get me permission to use the bridge so I can cross over into the alternate universe.\nOLIVIA: Why would you want to cross over?\nPETER: Because I think the machine is my best chance of getting home. And Walter created it, but clearly he's not gonna help me recalibrate it, so I\u2019m hoping that Walternate will.\nOLIVIA: Walternate is an untrustworthy sonnuvabitch who is responsible for sending Shapeshifters to our universe. So what makes you think that he'll help you?\nPETER: I really don't have any other choice.\nOLIVIA: Okay, in any case, Broyles isn't gonna let you near that bridge. I mean, you may have gained some trust here, but to him, you're still an unknown entity. Besides, Peter, they don't know that you exist. And Walternate is their Secretary of Defense. I mean, how are you gonna get to him at the D.o.D.? (answers another knock at front door)\nAGENT LEE: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nAGENT LEE: I brought you some chicken soup. I thought maybe you could use a little... (steps inside) company... which I see you already have.\nPETER: Him.\nAGENT LEE: Me.\nPETER: You're how I\u2019m gonna get into the D.o.D. On the other side, Fringe Division reports directly to the Secretary of Defense. Their lead agent...\nOLIVIA: Is Lincoln Lee. Yeah, that could work.\nPETER: I think it will work -- all I need is a way to get over to the other side.\nAGENT LEE: I'm sorry. What are we talking about?\nOLIVIA: Here it is. (hands-over paperwork)\nPETER: A Massive Dynamic requisition form? What's Item 317?\nOLIVIA: It's Walter's portal device -- the one he used to cross over in 1985.\nPETER: That's at the bottom of Reiden Lake.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe where you're from, but Massive Dynamic recovered it years ago. It's been in storage ever since.\nPETER: And you just happened to have this handy?\nOLIVIA: I've been thinking about crossing over myself, doing a little recon.\nPETER: Well, what do you even need Walter's device for when you can just cross back and forth anytime by yourself?\nOLIVIA: When I can what?\nAGENT LEE: Smart-- you were gonna go over there off-grid, find out what the shapeshifters are after.\nOLIVIA: See if I can expose Walternate's entire agenda. Peter's just given us a way in.\nPETER: Whoa, whoa. No, that's not at all what we're about to do. Look, I understand that you guys are dealing with real and present dangers from the other side, but if we go over there and you get busted, there's no way that Walternate's not gonna think that I\u2019m involved. I'm gonna lose the best chance that I have to get back to my timeline, to my people. You got to understand that.\nOLIVIA: Of course. (capitulates) Getting you home is a priority for us as well. So right now this is about you. Lincoln and I will secure a van and collect the device from Massive Dynamic.\nPETER: Alright, then. Let's go get our ride. (leaves)\nAGENT LEE: You got something on your mind? (privately)\nOLIVIA: Yep.\n(waiting at the entrance to the restrooms of a large urban transportation hub)\nMOM: Honey, you sure you don't want me to come in with you?\nSON: Yeah.\nMOM: Okay, well, I'll be right out here if you need me.\nSON: (enters the lav and hears brutal struggling in one of the stalls. runs from the restroom) Mom!\nMOM: Excuse me, officer. (taps the shoulder of a uniformed officer on duty) There's some inappropriate behavior going on in the men's restroom, and my eight-year-old was just subjected to it.\nCOP: (marches into the restroom) Alright, Transit P.D. Come on out of there. (opens the stall door and comes face-to-face with a transitioning shapeshifter that races from the area. leaving the corpse, the officer dashes after the suspect, leaves the building and watches as the shapeshifter runs effortlessly over a tall bus. the jump into traffic proves fatal as another large vehicle strikes, and kills the mutant)\nINTERCOM: Mister Secretary, Brandon Fayette is here to see you, as requested.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Send him in.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (enters carrying a small container) Mister Secretary, I was told you wanted me to bring you the shapeshifter tech.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You've been working on this for several weeks. How much longer will it take?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: I'm not sure. But I\u2019ve identified a signal that we might be able to trace. (confident) If I\u2019m right, it should lead us to whoever's responsible for these new shapeshifter prototypes.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I want you to forward me your diagnostic protocols. And leave the disk with me. I'll handle the back-trace myself.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Sir, are you sure? I feel I\u2019m close. I would like to see this --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (curt) I shouldn't have to remind you that I am also a scientist. I'm perfectly capable of completing the task.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: No, sir. Of course.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I'll send for you if I need anything else. (studies the new tech)\nBOLIVIA: So the guy scales the bus and then jumps thirty feet off its roof.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's what the witness report said. (looking at the thing in the body bag) Gets a 9.5 for the attempt, but he failed to stick the landing.\nELIAS KANE: (approaching with an armed military detail) May I have your attention, please? All Fringe Division and ancillary personnel are required to withdraw from the area immediately.\nLINCOLN LEE: Excuse me. Want to tell me what you think you're doing?\nELIAS KANE: I'm Sergeant Elias Kane, Department of Defense. This investigation is now under the jurisdiction of Military Command.\nBOLIVIA: The hell it is. On who's orders?\nLINCOLN LEE: Secretary of Defense. Alright, everybody! Pack it up, clear it out!\nBOLIVIA: What, you're just gonna let that happen?\nLINCOLN LEE: It's out of our hands.\nBOLIVIA: We work for the D.o.D., too. Why would Secretary Bishop remove us from what is clearly a Fringe case?\nLINCOLN LEE: Ours is not to question why, ours is just to get the hell out. (leaves the scene)\nOLIVIA: (answers hands-off cell call while driving South through Connecticut) Dunham.\nAGENT LEE: (on speaker) I was able to get the equipment. I'll meet you at the theater.\nOLIVIA: Great. We'll see you there. (ends call. To Peter) Now, what makes you so sure that there's a soft spot between universes in this place?\nPETER: Well, we've used it before... in another timeline. We're still about forty miles out.\nOLIVIA: (checks remaining mileage of new, eco-friendly electric vehicle) It's fine. We've still got plenty of range.\n(after they arrived in the theater and start setting-up equipment onstage to create a portal)\nPETER: You alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I\u2019m okay.\nPETER: You know, you really don't have to be here.\nOLIVIA: No, we have an arrangement. If something happens and you two can't get back, I have to be here to let Broyles know.\nAGENT LEE: (walks out after changing from his FBI business suit to Fringe Division garb consistent with his alternate universe counterpart) So this look about right?\nPETER: Yeah, you look good.\nOLIVIA: (approaches Lee. plucks his hair to match his counterpart. whispers so Peter won't hear) Okay. You're clear on everything, right? What you need to do?\nPETER: Are you ready?\nAGENT LEE: (walks to the threshold of the portal that will soon appear) Just out of curiosity, um... if this thing closes while I\u2019m still crossing through, what happens?\nPETER: (as the portal powers-up) It'll cut you in half. I killed a guy like that once. Don't worry. He was a bad guy. Olivia, thank you. I owe you one. (steps through)\nOLIVIA: (to Lee) Good luck.\nPETER: (to Lee after he steps through and the portal has been closed) You okay?\nAGENT LEE: (personal inventory check completed) One piece.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (calling to her supervisor as sensor alarms sound a warning in the Situation Room) Colonel Broyles, sensors detecting a Class-Three Breach.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: That's impossible. (rushes to the monitors) We haven't had any degradation since the universes were linked.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Nonetheless, sir, redundant systems are confirming a breach at an opera house in Lower Brooklyn.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Where are Agents Lee and Dunham?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: En route to H.Q., ten minutes out.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (quickly. urgent) Notify them of the breach and redirect them there. And dispatch an Amber Team to meet them.\nAGENT LEE: (leaving the theater that just got tagged as a Class 3 Breach) This place isn't all that different from our -- (tongue-tied at the sight of the twin World trade Center towers filling the skyline)\nPETER: (all business) Hey Scarecrow, come on. The flying monkeys are coming.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (escorting his military detail with a body bag on a gurney) Thank you, gentlemen. Bring the body in here.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: Sir, may I ask what's going on?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Nothing to concern yourself with. I need you and your staff to vacate the lab until further notice. Sergeant Kane, please stand guard at the door. Make sure no one disturbs me. (unzips the body bag and cuts into the corpse with a scalpel. he reaches inside the cadaver and retrieves another high tech disk to add to the collection)\n(approaches the sentry posted at the foot of the pier for the ferry commuter to Liberty Island. Peter's hands are restrained behind him)\nAGENT LEE: (handling Peter by the scruff) How's it going?\nCORPORAL WHEELER: Agent Lee, good to see you again.\nAGENT LEE: I've got a prisoner here I need to transport to Liberty Island.\nCORPORAL WHEELER: (checks log) I don't have any transport order.\nAGENT LEE: (lowers tone) No, you wouldn't. Secretary Bishop wants to keep this one off the books -- keeping it quiet for security reasons. (indignant) You think I\u2019m making this up?\nCORPORAL WHEELER: No. Not at all, sir. I can call up the SecDef's office to clear it up.\nAGENT LEE: Sure, you speak to somebody there. They clear it with someone else, who clears it up the chain. That's at least three people you just included in a classified interrogation. (mocking) You go right ahead. It's your ass, not mine.\nCORPORAL WHEELER: I see what you mean. You know what? I'll send for the ferry.\nAGENT LEE: Good idea.\nCORPORAL WHEELER: I just need your \"Show Me.\"\nAGENT LEE: Yeah, uh, about that... I had to jump into the East River to catch this scumbag. Must've lost it in the drink.\nCORPORAL WHEELER: That's fine. Your handprint will do. (holds out biometric scan pad for Lee's palm print) The ferry should be at the pier shortly. (Lee grabs Peter scruff and walks toward the loading area on the dock) Agent Lee... I'll go ahead and report your \"Show Me\" lost.\nAGENT LEE: (stops. looks back)) Thanks. (continues walking)\nPETER: (smartly) I'm impressed -- quite a knack for deception.\nLINCOLN LEE: (over tactical comm) Colonel... we checked our readings again. They're still negative. If there was any kind of degradation here, it's gone now.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (listening from the Situation Room) Copy that. The breach is no longer registering here either.\nLINCOLN LEE: Looks like a false alarm. Maybe there was a glitch with the sensors?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Maybe. Recall your team and report back to H.Q.\nLINCOLN LEE: (after the transmission) Dreaming of a life in the theater?\nBOLIVIA: (still focused on earlier events) You know, that body at the bus terminal -- his face was pretty messed-up.\nLINCOLN LEE: (humorously) The guy was pancaked by a bus.\nBOLIVIA: I mean his features. They didn't add up. They were all mismatched. His hair, his eyes-- one blue, one brown.\nLINCOLN LEE: Okay.\nBOLIVIA: Well, you add that to the fact that he ran up the side of a bus, then jumped ten yards and landed on his feet. I think he might've been a shapeshifter.\nLINCOLN LEE: You mean those human shapeshifters the other side's accusing us of sending over. (ponders the concept) Okay. Well, I guess once the D.o.D. Confirms that with the autopsy, Secretary Bishop will let us know.\nBOLIVIA: (leaving the building for the SUV) Unless he doesn't. I mean, their Olivia said that she believed he was responsible for these new shapeshifters.\nLINCOLN LEE: Since when do you listen to anything they have to say? You said yourself she's a paranoid who doesn't trust anyone.\nBOLIVIA: Yeah, that doesn't mean she's not right. I mean, think about it. What if the Secretary had us removed from the crime scene so that he could cover up his own involvement?\nLINCOLN LEE: Now who's paranoid? (hops into the driver's seat to start the vehicle) Okay. Why won't the car start? (data monitor indicates his identification was reported missing by Liberty Pier security) Lost? I never reported it lost.\nBOLIVIA: They said the report came from the D.o.D. checkpoint at the pier.\nCORPORAL WHEELER: (answer call on his earpiece while standing sentry at Liberty Pier) Checkpoint Five, Corporal Wheeler.\nLINCOLN LEE: Wheeler, this is Agent Lee. I understand somebody there reported my \"Show Me\" lost.\nCORPORAL WHEELER: Agent Lee? (turns to verify that the Lee he granted access to is still on the pier)\nPETER: (standing and talking while waiting for the ferry boat) Once I get in to see Walternate, you should probably take off, head back to the opera house before they figure out you're not who you say you are.\nAGENT LEE: You've been there before, their D.o.D. It was in your debrief with Broyles after you showed-up.\nPETER: Yeah, Walternate wanted to keep me close when I was working on the machine.\nAGENT LEE: In his secure room. You said that's where he kept his classified files. If you worked in it, you must know how to get into it.\nPETER: (growing suspicious) Why are we talking about this, Lincoln?\nAGENT LEE: Just tell me where it's located, Peter.\nPETER: (disappointed) Oh, I don't believe this.\nAGENT LEE: You don't have to be involved.\nPETER: (angered) Of course they're gonna think I\u2019m involved! You're about to ruin the best chance...\nAGENT LEE: I didn't come this far... to go back empty-handed!\nPETER: That I have to get back home!\nLINCOLN LEE: (approaches with team and weapons drawn) Don't move! Put your hands behind your head!\nPETER: Just give me a chance to explain. Look, I know how this looks, but it's a misunderstanding.\nLINCOLN LEE: Agent Lee, I presume.\nPETER: We can straighten this out. I have to talk to Secretary Bishop.\nBOLIVIA: (meeting for the first time) Who the hell are you?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (at work on the shapeshifter technology in Doctor Fayette's lab. answers the intercom beep) Yes?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (calling from his office) Mister Secretary, it's Colonel Broyles. Sorry to disturb you, but you need to know there's been an incursion from the other universe. We've apprehended two men who were on their way to you. One is their Fringe Division's Lincoln Lee. The other man... he claims to be Peter Bishop, your son.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: My son?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: That's what he said, sir. We'll attempt to ascertain his real identity once we have them in custody. Agents Lee and Dunham are convoying the prisoners back to Fringe H.Q. now for questioning. Do you want me to contact the other side... demand an explanation?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (uncharacteristically somber) No. Tell them nothing until you've had a chance to interrogate these men. And keep me informed with what you learn.\nPETER: (sitting in a prisoner cage in the back of a Fringe Division vehicle driving uptown) This was Olivia's idea, wasn't it?\nAGENT LEE: Doesn't matter much now, does it?\nPETER: Yeah, it matters to me. I thought I could trust you two.\nAGENT LEE: I get it, Peter. You want to go home to your people. Well, we are fighting for our people. Whatever these shapeshifters are up to, we have to stop them. Sorry if I thought you wanted that, too.\nPETER: It's not my fight.\nMURPHY: (driver answers his earpiece) Agent Murphy. (listens) Affirmative, sir. As a matter of fact, I have them in my transport right now. (listens) Alright, sir. I understand. (swerves from convoy onto an intersecting street)\nLINCOLN LEE: (watches in rearview mirror as the convoy disperses and traffic snarls) What just happened? We lost the transport. (skids the vehicle through a U-turn to pursue)\nBOLIVIA: (on tactical comm) Agent Murphy, Agent Cole, do you copy? Agent Murphy, Agent Cole, respond. Hey!\nCOLE: (hears call from lead vehicle) Murphy, what's going on? (is shot once in the chest by Murphy)\nBOLIVIA: Transport One, this is Dunham. (as Lincoln swerves in and out of traffic congestion) Do you copy? Agent Murphy, come in.\nLINCOLN LEE: (on comm to HQ) Agent Farnsworth, where is the locate on that prisoner transport?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (over comm link) Still looking. Stand by.\nMURPHY: (screeches to a halt in a back alley) Get out. The cuffs -- take 'em off.\nPETER: You trying to make this look like an escape attempt, like we're the ones that killed your partner?\nMURPHY: Your turn. Let's go.\nPETER: That call you got -- was that from Secretary Bishop? Did he tell you to do this? He's making a mistake. I just came here to talk to him. He doesn't understand why I\u2019m here.\nMURPHY: It doesn't matter why you're here. I have my orders. (aims pistol at Peter's chest. distracted by gunfire from Cole. Peter wrestles with him. Lee knocks him to the ground, grabs the pistol and shoots him)\nPETER: We got to get out of here, now. Give me the gun. Give me the gun! We're doing this my way now.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (watching tracking software on her monitor) You're a hundred meters from the transport. Wait. They're on the move again.\nBOLIVIA: What?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Take the next alley. There are two transponders still in the alley.\nBOLIVIA: (to Lincoln) Okay, you let me out. You stay with the transport. (dismounts as Lincoln races after the errant vehicle. over comm channels) We've got two agents down.\nDISPATCH: All units, the suspects are headed North down the alley by Franklin and Broadway.\nLINCOLN LEE: (after blocking in Agent Lee) Out of the vehicle, now! On the ground. (searches the vehicle)\nBOLIVIA: (after the two Lee's return to the back alley) So where is he?\nAGENT LEE: I have no idea. I told you, he ran.\nLINCOLN LEE: (shares the latest intel) Agent Murphy's 'Show Me' was used at the Canal Street subway turnstile twenty minutes ago.\nBOLIVIA: So you led us on that little diversion so your friend could get away.\nLINCOLN LEE: Broyles put his description out to Transit and Metro P.D. He won't get far. You and your pal murdered two Fringe agents. Every cop in the city is gonna be looking for him.\nAGENT LEE: Right. That's what happened. We came all this way to kill two Fringe agents. (snide) That's brilliant. No wonder you're a detective.\nLINCOLN LEE: Makes a hell of a lot more sense than Agent Murphy shooting his own partner, then trying to kill you two because somebody called him up and ordered him to do it.\nBOLIVIA: So who on our side would want you dead?\nAGENT LEE: Your boss... the Secretary of Defense.\nLINCOLN LEE: (counter-snide) So, clearly, in the other universe, I\u2019m a nut job.\nBOLIVIA: What makes you so sure that it was the Secretary on the other end of that call?\nAGENT LEE: Our universe has been infiltrated by shapeshifters from your side. They've killed a lot of people, including a friend of mine for -- for reasons I still don't understand. And your Defense Secretary's behind them. He's obviously got people inside your Division working for him. You take me in, he's gonna see to it I disappear. Trace the call. You trace the call that was made to Agent Murphy. If it leads back to Secretary Bishop, you know I\u2019m right.\nLINCOLN LEE: If our Division's compromised, why trust us?\nAGENT LEE: Because of her. Peter said I could trust you.\nBOLIVIA: He doesn't even know me.\nAGENT LEE: (earnest) Peter said at the end of the day, you're a good person. You'd do the right thing.\nLINCOLN LEE: (pregnant pause) Liv?\nBOLIVIA: We'll sort it out at Headquarters.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (arrives home and parks in the driveway. grabs the groceries, goes in the house, tosses everything on the counter, starts snacking and unpacking. notices the sliding door to the back is open, nits the silent alarm and grabs her purse to leave. is startled when she is intercepted at the front door) Oh, gawd!\nPETER: (extremely apologetic) I\u2019m sorry. I'm not here to hurt you, I --\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (offers her wallet) -- I have money. Just take --\nPETER: Oh, no, you don't understand. I just need to speak with your husband. It's very important.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (studies his face and his manner. thinks she knows who she is talking to) Peter?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (sitting opposite one another. maternally close) Over the years, my husband has opened my mind to things that I never thought possible. And still, I never thought that... but as soon as I looked into your eyes, I knew. (caresses his cheek) They, um... they told me that you died... the night that you were taken from me.\nPETER: And they told you the truth. I'm sorry, Elizabeth. I'm not the Peter that you think I am. I'm from another place. It's all very complicated. But I have people there that I care about very, very deeply, and I have to get back to them.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (candid) That's what got me through it, you know? I told myself that if another universe exists -- and there's got to be more -- then somewhere... you would grow up and be happy and... and fall in love. (bittersweet) Somewhere you would have a life... just -- just not here.\nPETER: That's why I came here. It's why I need to speak to Walter. He's the only person who can help me.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Yeah, of course. If -- if your father -- if Walter knew that you were here, he would do everything he could to help you. He's, um... he's at work. (stands to get the phone) I\u2019ll call the office.\nPETER: Oh, no. No. No, I - I'm sorry. You can't do that. You can't let anybody else know that I\u2019m here. When I first crossed over, people who worked for your husband tried to kill me.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: What? Why would anyone try to --\nPETER: I don't know. But clearly someone thinks that my being here is a threat.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Then, Peter... we need to protect you. Walter has to know about this.\nPETER: I think that he already does. (vehicles rush into the driveway)\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (remembers her initial reaction to his intrusion) The alarm. Oh, god, I\u2019m sorry. Before I knew it was you, I - I hit the alarm. Peter, why have you got a gun?\nSOLDIER: Mrs. Bishop.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Give me the gun.\nSOLDIER: Mrs. Bishop.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Peter, if you don't give me the gun, they will shoot you.\nSOLDIER: Mrs. Bishop, are you alright?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (sincerely) I won't let anything happen to you... not this time. Okay, don't shoot.\nSOLDIER: (rushing through the door with a squad) That's him. Hands in the air!\nELIZABETH BISHOP: Okay, don't shoot! (stands in front of Peter) Don't shoot!\nSOLDIER: Mrs. Bishop, step away. This man is dangerous. He's killed two Fringe agents.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: No, anyone who fires on this man will have my husband to answer to. A mistake has been made. I need your men to transport us to the Department of Defense. (let's the impact of her promise soak in) You heard me. We are going to see my husband.\nSOLDIER: He'll have to be restrained.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: That's fine. (as Peter is cuffed) Walter will straighten all this out. You'll see. (the group leaves the house)\nAGENT LEE: (as he is cuffed to a vertical pipe in a utility room) What the hell is this?\nLINCOLN LEE: This is where we're holding you.\nAGENT LEE: It's a maintenance closet.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's very astute. (snarky) No wonder you're a detective.\nBOLIVIA: We looked into Agent Murphy's phone logs, and he did receive a call just before the vehicle disappeared from the convoy.\nAGENT LEE: Like I said.\nBOLIVIA: We're gonna trace the call, and if it leads back to the Secretary of Defense, then we can talk. If not, this isn't the last windowless room you're gonna find yourself in.\nLINCOLN LEE: Make yourself comfortable. Nobody knows you're here but us. (after leaving the closet and closing the door) We're breaking about five different General Orders right now. I hope you know what you're doing.\nBOLIVIA: Me too.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (with security escort in-tow. marches in to her husband's office and directly to his side) Walter. It's Peter. It's a miracle.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Of course it is. (calmly. to Peter) I've dreamt about this moment for so many years. And now you're actually here... standing in front of me. Take these restraints off him.\nSOLDIER: Sir --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Take them off. And then leave us.\nPETER: I know... I know that you don't want to hear this right now, Secretary Bishop, but... I'm not your son.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I know that. How could you be?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: He came to ask for your help. I promised him you would.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Would you leave us for a moment, Elizabeth?\nELIZABETH BISHOP: I --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I'd -- I'd like to speak to Peter alone. Just a few moments, please, dear.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (uncomfortable with the request) Alright... alright. (stops at Peter's side on her way out)\nPETER: (softly) Thank you. (after she leaves. to Bishop) I must say, that was a brilliant performance. You almost looked genuinely surprised to see me, which we both know is not the case.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I've known about you for some time. (removes a handheld gizmo from a secure box on his desk) I've been monitoring the intelligence feeds from the other universe.\nPETER: Yeah, if by 'monitoring' you mean 'spying'.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You have a very ill opinion of me.\nPETER: (slowly pacing the room as the gizmo is powered-up) Where I\u2019m from, I know you all too well.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Really? What do you know?\nPETER: For starters, I know you've already tried to have me killed once today.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: And why would I do that?\nPETER: I don't know, Walter. Maybe you see me as a threat. They know that you created the human shapeshifters. And they know that you're responsible for sending them into the alternate universe, in violation of your accord with them.\nWALTER: So you have come all this way to bring me to justice.\nPETER: No. Whatever disagreements there are between this universe and theirs are none of my business. I'll tell you exactly what I told them. It is not my fight. All I want is your help to get me back where I belong... to get me home. If you want to get rid of me, just help me.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: If you believe that I am to blame for all those terrible things, your decision to come here must've been difficult.\nPETER: I didn't really have any other choice.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I see. Well, no one knows more about the burden of difficult decisions than I.\nBRANDON FAYETTE: (enters the office) Sir, Sergeant Kane said you wanted to see me.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Doctor. Come in. Doctor Fayette, this man is from the other side. He is making serious accusations against me. He believes, among other things, that I am responsible for the shapeshifters that are plaguing the other universe. Now, you are my Chief Scientist. You know me and my operation better than anyone. Is it possible? Is there any way that what he is saying could be true?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: I don't see how, sir. I examined the shapeshifter tech in detail. I saw nothing to indicate you had anything to do with it, sir.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (to Peter) There. You see?\nBRANDON FAYETTE: If I may ask... (convulses to the floor after being zapped by the handheld gizmo)\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (to Peter. foreboding) Not everything is as it seems.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (in one of his labs. standing over the fresh corpse he just caused) I've suspected for some time that Doctor Fayette had been replaced by a shapeshifter. My men have been following him for some weeks, monitoring all of his communications.\nPETER: So what are you gonna do with him?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Interrogate him, get what information I can to find out who's behind this. Earlier today, a State Department employee was the victim of another shapeshifter... trying to acquire his identity. It's become all too clear that elements of our government are being infiltrated.\nPETER: If you've known about this for so long, why haven't you done anything?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Done what exactly? If word got out that elected officials and other authorities were not who they claimed to be, it would cause widespread panic, and society would collapse.\nPETER: No, trust me on this. You have to find the shapeshifters, expose them for what they are.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: And how would you propose I do that?\nPETER: Well, that device you used seemed to do the trick.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Yes. And I spent weeks convincing myself that Doctor Fayette had been replaced. If I had been wrong, this tech would've killed a human being.\nPETER: Why are you telling me all of this?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (lowers his tone. slows his cadence) Because you are the only person I can trust. You have no alliances... to our side or theirs. I'm telling you this because I need you to deliver a message.\nPETER: I appreciate what you're up against here, but --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: It's not your fight?\nPETER: (snaps) Exactly. It's not my fight. I came here because I needed your help... to get home. The Walter on the other side refuses to help me, but you understand that machine. You share his mind. You're the only person who can help me get back to where I belong.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (promising) And I will do everything in my power to help you get home. But you must go back to the other side and tell them that I am not their enemy. (ominous) Whoever is behind this is a threat to us all.\nPETER: (rethinking) I was wrong about you. You're not the man I thought you were.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: You are exactly the man I thought you would be. (proprietary) Please do this for me, Peter. Help us.\nBOLIVIA: (joins her partner at his workstation in the Situation Room. hushed) Agent Farnsworth traced the call to Murphy's cuff back to an industrial park in the Flatiron District. The area's been abandoned since the 'Amber Riots' of '06.\nLINCOLN LEE: (soft-spoken in the busy room) The Flatiron District... that doesn't sound like it's connected to the D.o.D. or Secretary Bishop.\nBOLIVIA: Maybe it isn't, but we should still check it out.\nLINCOLN LEE: Liv, how much longer are we gonna keep Broyles in the dark?\nBOLIVIA: We're just following up on a lead.\nLINCOLN LEE: No. We're chasing the story of a suspect who may have murdered two of our own agents... and who, by the way, we locked in a broom closet instead of Holding, where he belongs.\nBOLIVIA: What if he's right?\nLINCOLN LEE: What if he's not? We have to tell Broyles something.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (as his agents approach him in his office) Did you process the prisoner into Holding?\nLINCOLN LEE: He's been secured, sir.\nBOLIVIA: But that's not why we're here.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I take it this is about the trace you ran on Agent Murphy's ear cuff. Agent Farnsworth told me. You want to tell me what it is you're looking for?\nBOLIVIA: Uh, well, it may be nothing, but until we know more... we would like some leeway on this.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (sighs. thinks for a second) Okay. Keep me posted.\nBOLIVIA: Yes, sir. Thank you. (nods and leaves)\n(Fringe Division Chief, Colonel Philip Broyles, makes a call once his office is vacated)\nDAVID JONES: (on intercom) Colonel Broyles.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: They're on their way to you now.\nDAVID JONES: Excellent. (busy in his lab as shapeshifters are hurried about on gurneys) We'll be waiting for them.\n(laying still on the stage, waiting for her men to return through the portal. Olivia senses she is not alone, hops to her feet, draws her weapon and aims at the sudden visitor a few rows away)\nOLIVIA\/THE OBSERVER: (parroting in unison) Who are you? Who are you? Show me your hands. Show me your hands. How did you -- how did you? Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you?\nTHE OBSERVER: (strained) I have come to tell you something... Olivia.\nOLIVIA: How did you know my name? (steps closer) How do you know my -- (holsters weapon. looks at his chest) you've been shot?\nTHE OBSERVER: I came to tell you... I have looked at all possible futures... and in every one, the result is the same. (struggling to breathe) You have to die.\nOLIVIA: (returns to stage for her phone) I'm gonna get you to a hospital. (turns back and the theater is empty. the wounded bald men disappeared as suddenly as he arrived)"

What are you doing here, sir?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I understand you have a detainee -- Agent Lincoln Lee from the other side.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: That's right. (about Peter) Who's this?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Please see that Agent Lee is released immediately. As far as the rest... well, perhaps best I explain in private.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (privately. in his office) Shape-shifters? You're certain about this?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I wouldn't be here if I weren't. And if the Department of Defense can be infiltrated, then clearly every branch of our government is vulnerable. COLONEL BROYLES: You're suggesting that Fringe --\nSECRETARY BISHOP: We have reason to believe that your Agent Murphy may have been one of them. We'll know for sure as soon as he's autopsied.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Do we have any idea who they're answering to?\nSECRETARY BISHOP: No. Nor do we understand their end... what their agenda is. COLONEL\nBROYLES: We might know more soon. Agents Lee and Dunham ran a trace on Murphy's last phone call. They're following up as we speak.\nLINCOLN LEE: (clear of their vehicle and heading into the seemingly abandoned building their trace led to) I don't know. I've known Murphy since the Academy. He's always been a straight arrow. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, I just got kind of a hunch that this other Lincoln's telling us the truth. LINCOLN LEE: Must be because he has such a trustworthy face. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: (chuckles) See, I think he's kind of funny-looking. (subtle jab) LINCOLN LEE: You're funny-looking. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: (hears a noise. enters the building. finds her quarry) Don't move. LINCOLN LEE: (demanding) Put your hands up. DAVID JONES: (turns and raises his hands. about his 'project' in an incubation tank) Do you know what she is? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: A shape-shifter. DAVID JONES: She was once just a human being like any other. LINCOLN LEE: Until you killed her. DAVID JONES: Oh, she's not dead. Though in a manner of speaking, she was. A bookkeeper for an accounting firm -- can you imagine anything more lifeless? (droll humor) I suppose this it what is feels like to have a child... to love as a parent does. (elated) BOLIVIA DUNHAM: You must be very proud. DAVID JONES: Oh, I am... of all of them. Forty-seven so far. And each one... perfect. I\u2019m so sorry. LINCOLN LEE: (as the shapeshifter struggles to live) What are you doing to it? DAVID JONES: To her! Isn't it obvious. (as the creature dies) Now I\u2019m killing her. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Why'd you do that? DAVID JONES: (menacing) Because you don't know me or what I\u2019m capable of. But if I\u2019m willing to do that to someone I love dearly, imagine what I'll do to people I don't care about. LINCOLN LEE: And what is it you need? DAVID JONES: From you? Nothing. You don't have the authority. (willingly surrenders) Take me to your leader.\nWALTER: (hears that he has company and assumes it is someone else) How's the cheese coming? Is it done soaking yet? Ah! Agent... Dunham. Hey. Look... spherical pastrami. (holds-up plate) You hungry? OLIVIA: Uh... no. Thank you. Um, I was looking for Astrid. ASTRID: (walks in with heavy gloves, carrying a bowl) Hey. Walter's just discovered molecular gastronomy. WALTER: I liquefied the meat, then placed it in an alginate bath. It's \u2013 it's really quite... ASTRID: ...disgusting. (confident in her assessment) WALTER: That's the thing about scientific inquiry -- not every experiment is a success. But I hold high hopes for the parmesan ice cream. OLIVIA: (to Astrid) You've had a fun day? ASTRID: (smiles) The best. What's up? OLIVIA: I was hoping you could do something for me. Uh, could you check this blood sample against the national and international databases? ASTRID: Am I looking for anything in particular? OLIVIA: I don't know -- a name, a genetic marker, anything out of the ordinary. ASTRID: (studies Olivia's timid attitude) What's going on? You seem troubled. OLIVIA: (confessing) I helped Peter and Lincoln cross over to the other universe. Since Walter's refusing to help Peter get back to where he's from, he thinks that Walternate may help him. And Lincoln's doing recon on the shape-shifters. ASTRID: Whoa. And what does that have to do with the blood sample? OLIVIA: Probably nothing, but can you call me if you find anything? ASTRID: Mm. OLIVIA: And wish me luck. ASTRID: Where are you going? Why do you need luck? (figures out the timid attitude) Because Broyles doesn't know anything about this, does he? OLIVIA: And Peter and Lincoln should have been back by now, so I\u2019m gonna have to go and tell him what's been going on. ASTRID: Huh. Good luck.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (as Olivia approaches in the heavily manned secure parking garage) What do we know? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: That he is certifiable. Apart from that, nothing else. COLONEL BROYLES: I.D.? LINCOLN LEE: We didn't find a Show-Me -- no surprise there. We ran his biometrics through all the databases -- criminal, medical, insurance. (as Jones is led from the vehicle by an armed tactical squad) Based on his accent, we even reached out to Scotland Yard. So far, nothing. COLONEL BROYLES: Anything at the location? LINCOLN LEE: Cleared it out before we got there. Science Division's doing a sweep. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: He knew we were coming. I mean, he was waiting for us to show up. COLONEL BROYLES: Take him to interrogation. I'll meet you there. And this time use an actual room, not the maintenance closet. LINCOLN LEE: Yes, sir. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yes, sir.\nAGENT LEE: (to a host agent) Thanks. (to Peter as he walks into the Situation Room) You hear they're bringing up the suspect? PETER: What suspect? AGENT LEE: The guy who's behind trying to have us killed, the guy behind the shape-shifters. OFFICE AGENT: (to Peter) Sir, your escort should be here shortly. PETER: Thank you. AGENT LEE: What escort? PETER: We're leaving. AGENT LEE: Wait a minute -- we might finally get some answers. We should stay here, and we should assist with the interrogation. PETER: No. I finally got Walternate to agree to help me. I don't think the way to say thank you is to tell him how to do his job. AGENT LEE: (pressuring) So that's it. Yeah, you... you got what you wanted. PETER: Yes, I got what I wanted. And whatever he finds out in that interrogation he's gonna share with you. So you got what you came for. And now all I want to do is get back to the other side, study the blueprints -- AGENT LEE: I need to be a part of this investigation. I lost a partner. (micro perspective) PETER: I lost a universe! (macro perspective) AGENT LEE: (pauses) You're scared. PETER: (admittedly) Yes, I am scared. I\u2019m scared that every day that I stay here the people that I love get farther and farther away from me. So let them do their jobs. There's nothing that you can do here that they can't do for themselves. (looks at the prisoner as he is led in. recognizes the culprit) LINCOLN LEE: (escorting the prisoner) Is the interrogation room ready? AGENT LEE: What is it? (turns to see what caught Peter's attention) You know that guy?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (sitting across from the prisoner) I\u2019m Colonel Broyles. I'd like to ask you some questions. DAVID JONES: I\u2019m sure you have an abundance of questions. But I doubt I'd answer any of them. Besides which, we don't have much time. I imagine you'd like to avoid unnecessary deaths. COLONEL BROYLES: We're not in the business of responding to threats. DAVID JONES: Oh, I wouldn't call it that. Consider it an... insurance policy. An agent of mine -- a shapeshifter posing as Doctor Brandon Fayette -- was taken off-line earlier today. In his office, above his desk, there is a light fixture. Remove the outer frame. Tucked inside, there is a hard drive. (issues ultimatum) You have twelve minutes to bring it to me. COLONEL BROYLES: Twelve? DAVID JONES: Not to worry. I've been assured that by helicopter, you can make it to the D.o.D. and back with two minutes to spare. COLONEL BROYLES: And what's on the hard drive? SECRETARY BISHOP: (watching from behind the glass in the observation room) Go. LINCOLN LEE: We'll call on our way back. (leaves with Bolivia) DAVID JONES: Nothing of interest to you, though I\u2019m sure you'll copy the contents before you let me go. COLONEL BROYLES: Before we let you go? Of course. Anything else you want while we're at it? DAVID JONES: Um... I wouldn't mind a cup of tea. SECRETARY BISHOP: (as his uninvited guests enter the observation room) I imagined you'd be on your way back home. PETER: I know who that man is. His name is David Robert Jones. SECRETARY BISHOP: (as Broyles joins the group) Go on. PETER: He's a scientist. He has a background in biotechnology and genetic weaponry. SECRETARY BISHOP: If you're right, we'll have a record of him -- we don't. He's not in any database. PETER: Because he's not from your universe. He crossed over from the other side. SECRETARY BISHOP: How can you be so certain? You've already said that things are different from your timeline. PETER: Let me talk to him. COLONEL BROYLES: Sir, I hardly think that's wise. DAVID JONES: (as Peter enters the interrogation room) Do you have my tea? PETER: Hardly. (sips his warm beverage) I do have some questions I'd like to ask you, though. DAVID JONES: Funny... the last man in here said the same thing. PETER: You're not from here, are you? DAVID JONES: Did the accent give it away? PETER: No. Actually, it was the scars. (starts the verbal fencing) AGENT LEE: (studying the monitor in the observation room) Did you see that? His pulse just went up. PETER: The last time I saw you, you were completely falling apart -- molecular disintegration due to transporting out of a German prison. (bravado) They had to wrap you in bandages just keep you from turning into a puddle on the floor. It seems like you figured out a way to heal yourself. Do you mind if I ask? What was it -- some sort of... DNA graft? DAVID JONES: I've never met you in my life. PETER: (menacing) No. But I've met you. DAVID JONES: Where? PETER: When you were crossing out of your universe into this one. You created a - a doorway, a portal. I\u2019m the man who closed it on you. It cut you right in half. DAVID JONES: (feigning disinterest) Interesting story. Yet I\u2019m still in one piece. I believe you've run out of time. COLONEL BROYLES: (answers call in the observation room) This is Broyles. INTERCOM: Sir, I have a woman on the line who says you're expecting her call. She says she's a friend of Mister Jones. COLONEL BROYLES: Go ahead. DOCTOR SAMUELS: Is Secretary Bishop on the line too? COLONEL BROYLES: Who is this? DOCTOR SAMUELS: (from a busy hospital ward) Can Mister Jones hear me as well? SECRETARY BISHOP: He can. What do you want?\nDOCTOR SAMUELS: Just for you to listen. (leaves speakerphone on. activates a device. walks from the ward) INTERN: Doctor Samuels, do you want me to give that little girl with the bike injury a Tetanus? DOCTOR SAMUELS: Not necessary. I don't think she's gonna make it. DYING VICTIMS: (as the ward fills with a gas from the device left at the duty desk by Samuels) Oh, my God. Help! Help! Help! Let me out of here! (Samuels grabs a crutch and places it through the handles on the double doors to the ward. visitors panic, unable to escape. the chilling screams fill Fringe Division. one victim places his hand on the safety glass in the ward. most of the skin on the palm of his hand slough-off as he slinks to the floor. dead)\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: There were sixteen people in the E.R. -- all of them dead. COLONEL BROYLES: And he says, if he's not released within fourteen minutes, the next attack will be worse. What do you want to do, sir? SECRETARY BISHOP: Prepare him for release. COLONEL BROYLES: What? AGENT LEE: (amazed that releasing Jones was even an option) You can't be serious. SECRETARY BISHOP: I understand your concerns Agent. I can't in good conscience allow him to continue to attack civilian targets. AGENT LEE: And you think capitulating is going to make him any less dangerous? Tell them. Tell them this is a terrible idea. LINCOLN LEE: (joins the enclave) What idea? AGENT LEE: They're gonna let Jones just walk right out of here. Do we even know what's on the hard disk? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Apparently, he was accessing government satellites. Astrid's reviewing the data now. SECRETARY BISHOP: Obviously, we'll be keeping him under constant surveillance. This situation may even play out to our advantage. We may learn who he's working with, where the other shape-shifters are. LINCOLN LEE: We can monitor him with an internal tracker. SECRETARY BISHOP: That's a good idea. LINCOLN LEE: I\u2019m glad you like it. I put one in his tea. COLONEL BROYLES: Agent Lee, Dunham... start organizing the surveillance detail. AGENT LEE: I'd like to help... if that's okay with you. COLONEL BROYLES: Any objections? LINCOLN LEE: None. DAVID JONES: (escorted by Broyles to the elevator and uncuffed) Much better, thank you. The hard drive, please. It's been a pleasure. (makes eye-contact with Peter. steps into the elevator and departs)\nLINCOLN LEE: (on tactical radio) Hey, Red, you got anything? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: (sitting on a bench with Agent Lee. watching Jones across the plaza) Uh, yeah. I mean, same as you. I\u2019m looking at a guy who knows he's being watched. He's gonna make a move soon, though. Check your watch. He's waiting for the lunch crowd. He's gonna try and get lost. LINCOLN LEE: I'll be waiting. AGENT LEE: (chit-chat) So you two seem close. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, we are. Oh, no, no. No, I mean, not -- just as partners. AGENT LEE: You don't have to say it like that, like you pity us. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, I just broke up with someone, and Lincoln's been my shoulder to cry on. (Jones moves) He just got up. What's he doing? (as he removes a bag from a litter barrel) LINCOLN LEE: I\u2019m guessing that's not lunch. COLONEL BROYLES: (over tactical radio) All units be advised -- suspect removed some kind of thermos from the trash. Place HAZMAT and E.O.D. personnel on standby. DAVID JONES: Hello. Would you like some money? NEARBY PEDESTRIAN: For real? DAVID JONES: Oh, yes. But I need your help giving away all of it. You see, I've realized that there's no point being... the richest man in the cemetery. (hands over wad of cash) NEARBY PEDESTRIAN: Huh. Alright. (loudly to all around) This guy's giving out free money! BOLIVIA DUNHAM: (as the crowd converges on Jones position) Are you seeing this? LINCOLN LEE: Yeah, I see it. What the hell is he up to? PETER: (watching with Farnsworth from HQ) Oh, no. AGENT FARNSWORTH: (on comm link} Colonel Broyles... we have a problem. COLONEL BROYLES: What is it? AGENT FARNSWORTH: The tracking software -- there's some sort of malfunction. Jones's tracking signal is multiplying. We're seeing forty or fifty dots and counting. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's the money. He knows he's being tracked. He's put trackers on the money. AGENT LEE: What? How the hell did he know what signal we're using? (runs after Bolivia to locate Jones) LINCOLN LEE: Damn it. (pursues on foot) COLONEL BROYLES: (over tactical radio) All units, move into the plaza and maintain a visual on the target. AGENT LEE: Excuse me! Fringe Division! BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Astrid, is there any way you can zero in on Jones? AGENT FARNSWORTH: I don't know which signal is his. LINCOLN LEE: I don't see him. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, I think I got him. (checks the data map on her handheld tracker) There's a new cluster of trackers forming by the fountain North of the plaza. (Jones drinks from the thermos left for him) Damn it. It just disappeared. Colonel Broyles, we lost him. COLONEL BROYLES: (watches from a back alley as Jones gets into a waiting limousine and drives off) Roger that. All personnel return to Fringe Division.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: (sits across from her sullen spouse as he sips some liquor. eating her diner) Walter, I know whatever happened today was a setback. SECRETARY BISHOP: There's more than that. We were severely compromised. (to the wait staff) Another, please. ELIZABETH BISHOP: And more Scotch is gonna change that? SECRETARY BISHOP: It was my decision, Elizabeth. I knew the risk. I took a -- an immense gamble. And now that man Jones is gone. ELIZABETH BISHOP: I don't think that's all you're upset about. You've gone over the blueprints, haven't you? Like Peter asked you to. SECRETARY BISHOP: Yes. I've tried to see what he's saying... that the machine is... capable of more than one function, that it can return him to his timeline. But I can't help him. And apparently, the other Walter refuses to... which is... ironic, given the lengths that that man went to in the past. ELIZABETH BISHOP: That is not your fault. It never was. SECRETARY BISHOP: Well, the outcome is still the same. I couldn't save our son then. And I can't help him now. (sips his refreshed drink) ELIZABETH BISHOP: Maybe I can. (has an novel idea) Maybe I can help Peter.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (standing at her workstation) These are all the files we got from the hard drive. It seems Mister Jones was using D.o.D satellite and ground-penetrating radar to gather geological information. COLONEL BROYLES: So he's looking for something underground. What's there -- minerals, oil deposits? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Nothing of obvious value. I've cross-referenced the subfolders to see which locations they researched the most, but so far, I haven't found any meaningful pattern. COLONEL BROYLES: Let me know if you do.(walks off) AGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, sir. PETER: (joins the savant) Do you mind if I take a look at your list of locations? AGENT FARNSWORTH: I don't mind. (keenly curious) Are you really from another timeline? PETER: Yeah, I think so. AGENT FARNSWORTH: (impressed. mildly infatuated) Cool. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: (on earphone) Hey, Lincoln, it's me. We're uploading Jones' face-recognition profile to the surveillance net now. (listens) No, they're detailed. We got some photos from the interrogation. Okay, well, call me when you do. AGENT LEE: (joins her at her desk) Any progress? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Nothing yet, no. You got something on your mind? AGENT LEE: Actually, yeah. (lowers his voice) That tracker we had on Jones -- how did he pinpoint the wavelength we were on that quickly? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What, you think someone from our team told him? AGENT LEE: You have a better idea? AGENT FARNSWORTH: I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. That man, Peter -- he says he knows where Jones is going. PETER: (after the group of investigators gather) I think he was looking for a mineral named Amphilicite. AGENT FARNSWORTH: It's found mostly under sizeable deposits of limestone. I overlooked its significance. PETER: Because on its own, it has no significance. In its natural state, it's inert. It's not really reactive, like helium. But if you know how to process it properly, it can be used as a power source. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: How do you know all this? PETER: Because where I\u2019m from, William Bell used a tiny amount of it to create a battery. Jones stole the battery. AGENT LEE: A battery made out of rock? PETER: Yes, trust me, with this stuff, you get a lot of bang for your buck. COLONEL BROYLES: Well, how much bang are we talking? PETER: Enough to blow a hole in the universe. I\u2019m guessing Jones must have figured out the same process that Bell did and possibly how to weaponize it. COLONEL BROYLES: Which is why he's looking for it. Any idea where he plans on getting it? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Of all the locations he was studying, the one with the most potential for Amphilicite is located... here. (calls up the overhead photo on the large briefing screen) AGENT LEE: The Hudson River Valley. AGENT FARNSWORTH: Right, and this is the map file they accessed the most on Doctor Fayette's hard drive -- the Mohonk Quarry. We contacted the quarry. They said they haven't seen any signs of trouble. PETER: Which means we may finally be one step ahead of him. COLONEL BROYLES: Contact Agent Lee. I want that quarry secured immediately. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yes, sir.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (after the convoy of response vehicles stop and troops dismount. over comm to HQ) We're on the scene. We've got the main entrance secured and the quarries cleared. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Looks like we beat Jones to it. LINCOLN LEE: (reads handheld scanner) Soil is undisturbed -- no signs of excavation for the last two months, at least. COLONEL BROYLES: Good. (to Division forces) Let's secure the ridge line. Take up positions on the western edge. No one gets in or out. PETER: Can you patch me through. AGENT FARNSWORTH: You're on. PETER: There's an access road above the quarry. It'd be easy for Jones to outflank you if you don't guard it. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What access road? PETER: It's just to the North of your position. LINCOLN LEE: There's no road. PETER: I\u2019m looking right at it. (image on briefing screen) Is this the map that we downloaded from Doctor Fayette's hard drive? AGENT FARNSWORTH: It is. Why? PETER: (suddenly realizes. disappointed) We're in the wrong universe.\nPhase One complete. Where do we stand on Phase Two?\nIn due time. We're working on her. She'll be ready soon."

They all look like the same man.\nOLIVIA: No, that's the one.\nBROYLES: We've been looking at these people for three years. Why did they make contact now?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. But he knew my name, he knew who I was, and he knew where to find me. And then he just vanished.\nBROYLES: What exactly did he say?\nOLIVIA: He said that he had seen all possible futures, and in every one, I had to die. I had Astrid run a sample of his blood. There was no match on the DNA, but she did find antibodies for the Spanish Flu.\nBROYLES: The Spanish Flu? Isn't that extinct?\nOLIVIA: Well, the last recorded epidemic was in 1919. Which makes them a minimum of ninety-one years old.\nBROYLES: I'm going to assign you a security detail.\nOLIVIA: I don't think that that's necessary.\nBROYLES: He threatened you.\nOLIVIA: I'm not sure that's what he was doing. I -- I think that he was trying to warn me.\nBROYLES: If he approaches you again, I expect you to notify me right away.\nOLIVIA: (nods in complete agreement) Of course.\nEMILY MALLUM: (sits in an alcove next to a large building. sketching. a vision pierces her mind and she quickly starts a new drawing. she finds the focal person of her vision walking by, finishes her sketch, then runs to deliver it to the man) Excuse me. (hands-over the drawing)\nJAYNE REYNAR: Do you know her?\nBOB ENGLEHART: No.\nJAYNE REYNAR: (looks at the drawing that was delivered) Oh, God. Is that supposed to be you?\nBOB ENGLEHART: Ah, she's talented. Twisted, but talented.\nJAYNE REYNAR: Why would anyone draw something like that?\nBOB ENGLEHART: (compassion for the maturity-impaired) Well, she's a teenager. Isn't that what they do? Play depressing music, and think about how everything sucks, and then try and make everyone else as miserable as they are. It's a stage.\nJAYNE REYNAR: Stage or not, that's creepy.\nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN: Hey, look out! Get those people back! (as a large steel I-beam breaks free from the construction site and falls to the sidewalk below. piercing the man who just received a warning from the teenager who foresaw his death)\nPETER: In my timeline, I can interact with the machine, but since I'm not supposed to exist here, it wouldn't respond to me.\nWALTER: It will require a biomechanical interfacing machine, calibrated specifically to your DNA. So you can operate it.\nPETER: You've done it before, Walter. You can do it again.\nOLIVIA: (arriving for the day) Good morning.\nWALTER: Hello, Olivia. We're discussing cis-acting meiotic double-strand break hot spots.\nASTRID: Don't worry, Olivia, I have no idea what he's talking about either.\nPETER: What he's talking about is finally trying to get me back home.\nOLIVIA: I heard that Walter's going to help you. I had to see you with my own eyes.\nWALTER: Oh, don't worry, Agent Dunham. This won't interfere with my usual work, I assure you. If you need me, I will give you my full attention.\nOLIVIA: It's okay, Walter. I'm just happy that you two are working together.\nPETER: I can't say you're gonna get his full attention, per se. He's a little wired up today. He's already electrocuted himself three times.\nWALTER: Which reminds me, I can't feel my urine response yet. I should probably go empty my bladder again. (excuses himself)\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nAGENT LEE: (from the accident scene as the skewered man is tagged, bagged and dragged-off by the ME) Hey. This is a weird one. It seems a crane operator lost control of an I-beam, which was then tragically introduced to a Robert Englehart.\nOLIVIA: And?\nAGENT LEE: A few moments before he was killed, someone handed Mister Englehart a sketch depicting him being skewered by that same I-beam, as if his death was predicted. (waits for a response) You still there?\nOLIVIA: Okay, so the person who -- who gave him the sketch, what did he look like, was he bald?\nAGENT LEE: No, it was a she. A teenage girl. A coworker of the victim was with him at the time. She thinks she could I.D. the girl if she saw her again.\nOLIVIA: Alright, well, we need to collect all the surveillance from the area.\nAGENT LEE: I'm already on it.\nDIANE MALLUM: (just getting home) There you are. Where have you been all afternoon? (kisses her daughter)\nEMILY MALLUM: Just around.\nDIANE MALLUM: Well, you know you're supposed to call when you're gone this long.\nEMILY MALLUM: (loses the backpack) Sorry. (flops onto the sofa next to her younger brother)\nDANNY MALLUM: (to Emily) I met that kid in 3-C today.\nJIM MALLUM: (just getting home too) Hey, guys.\nDANNY MALLUM: Dad's home.\nDIANE MALLUM: Perfect timing. Dinner's almost ready.\nJIM MALLUM: (gets a hug from his boy) Hey, Buddy. Hi.\nDIANE MALLUM: So how did it go today?\nJIM MALLUM: Well (kisses his wife) -- the interview was great. I start tomorrow.\nDIANE MALLUM: That's great.\n(in her room, Emily starts channeling another vision. he father her sneaks in and covers her eyes)\nJIM MALLUM: (about the pastoral drawing on her lap) Looks like the view from the lake house. You miss it, don't you?\nEMILY MALLUM: (emotionally burdened) Dad, aren't you tired of moving us all around so much... because of me?\nJIM MALLUM: Doesn't matter where we are. All that matters is we're together.\nEMILY MALLUM: Why did God make me like this?\nJIM MALLUM: (earnest) You know how I feel, Em. God has a purpose for all of us. Even if we can't understand it. But I do know - mine is to take care of you guys. Hey, at least it hasn't happened in a while. Let's, uh, keep these curtains closed at night, okay? Alright. You get some sleep. I'll see you in the morning.\nEMILY MALLUM: (as he leaves her room) I love you, Dad.\nJIM MALLUM: I love you too, Angel.\n(sitting at her desk, looking at the foreshadowing sketch of impalement. the boss approaches)\nBROYLES: Any luck? Agent Dunham. Were you able to I.D. the girl who drew the picture?\nOLIVIA: Not yet. Lincoln's with the witness at the moment, looking at footage from traffic and surveillance cameras in the area. (responds to the worried stare) What?\nBROYLES: (sits) I got a call from Health Services. You've been three times in the last month?\nOLIVIA: You checking up on me?\nBROYLES: I'm your Commanding Officer. They tell me these things.\nOLIVIA: Migraines. I needed a prescription, which is why I went to Health Services. Headaches, that's all. (grins, hesitates, asks anyway) Do you believe in fate, sir?\nBROYLES: (candidly) No. I don't.\nOLIVIA: Neither did I, but this drawing... how is it the day after a complete stranger tells me I'm going to die, I end up investigating a case where the victim's death is predicted? I mean, maybe -- that man from the opera house -- maybe he does know something.\nBROYLES: Just for the next few days... maybe we should be vigilant. Keep you out of harm's way. (leaves her be)\nAGENT LEE: (later. approaches as he takes another pain pill) Good news. Robert Englehart's coworker just I.D'ed the teenage girl from surveillance tapes. (hands-over photo) We got a good image from the bank across the street from the cafe.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so do we know where she went?\nAGENT LEE: We know where she didn't go. Surveillance showed her bypass the 8th Street Bus Stop, she also walked right by the subway entrance.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so there's a good chance that she lives somewhere in the area.\nAGENT LEE: Maybe she goes to school nearby.\n(sitting and drawing. a specific passenger catches her eye. she pursues him)\nEMILY MALLUM: Stop the bus! (to the heavens) I tried.\nDANNY MALLUM: (sitting at the dining room table working on his homework) Wait, 6\/8ths is the same as 3\/4ths?\nDIANE MALLUM: Right. You keep dividing the fractions in half, \u2018tll you can't without changing the denominator.\nDANNY MALLUM: (not too much of a brat) No offense, Mom, but I understand this way better when Emily explains it.\nOLIVIA: (to the Mallums after knocking at their front door) Uh, good morning, sir. Ma'am, sorry to bother you. I'm Agent Olivia Dunham, this is Lincoln Lee. We work for the FBI.\nJIM MALLUM: (congenial) What can I do for ya?\nAGENT LEE: We're looking for this girl. (holds out security camera photo) We've been going door to door, asking people if they know her. One of your neighbors said she might live in the building.\nJIM MALLUM: (studies the photo) No, I don't think so. What's her name?\nAGENT LEE: We don't know.\nOLIVIA: Do you mind if I ask who else lives here with you, Mister...\nJIM MALLUM: Mallum. Jim Mallum. It's just my wife Diane and our son. Danny, come here. You see this girl around? Wait, is she the one we see at the park every so often?\nDANNY MALLUM: I think so.\nJIM MALLUM: Yeah. That's Tanner Park. It's about four blocks over. You might want to try looking for her around that area.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. You've been very helpful.\nJIM MALLUM: I wish I could offer more.\nOLIVIA: (after the door closes) Did you happen to notice the cabinet?\nAGENT LEE: No, why?\nOLIVIA: Red backpack, same one she's wearing in the picture. So why did he lie to us?\nAGENT LEE: As soon as we get back to HQ, I'll get the paperwork started on getting a warrant.\nOLIVIA: (as Emily walks around the corner heading home) Maybe we won't have to. Uh, hi. I'm Olivia Dunham, and this is Lincoln. We both work for the FBI. It's okay, you're not in any trouble. We just want to talk. Did you draw this?\nEMILY MALLUM: Is he dead?\nOLIVIA: Yes, but I think you already knew that. How? How were you able to draw this before the accident?\nEMILY MALLUM: (frustrated) I don't know. I just see it... in my head... whenever I'm around someone who's gonna -- I just sense it.\nOLIVIA: You just sense what?\nEMILY MALLUM: Death.\nAGENT LEE: That drawing... did you see something else that's gonna happen? Maybe we can stop it.\nJIM MALLUM: (from the stoop to his building) Emily! Get in the house.\nAGENT LEE: Mister. Mallum \u2013\nJIM MALLUM: (protective) You can't question her without parental consent, and I'm not giving it.\nAGENT LEE: You lied to us.\nOLIVIA: Actually, sir, we don't need your consent. It's up to Emily whether or not she wants to talk to us.\nJIM MALLUM: Emily. Do you want to continue to answer these agents' questions?\nEMILY MALLUM: No.\nJIM MALLUM: There's your answer. Come on, Em. Let's go. Let me ask you something. You think you're the first people to come after my daughter? It always starts this way. Authorities show up when they get wind of a girl with her... ability. Then others come who want to study her, like those people at Massive Dynamic.\nAGENT LEE: Massive Dynamic?\nJIM MALLUM: And they never stop. No matter where we go, they find her. Watching from their cars, waiting for the right moment to grab her, take her to their labs. (angry) They poke and prod her like she's some kind of animal. You have any idea what that does to a young girl? Please... let my daughter have the chance at what's left of a normal childhood.\nOLIVIA: My number's on the card. (hands her business card to him) If you change your mind and want to talk, or if you and your family are being harassed, I think I can help. (to Lee as they hurry away) Okay, when we get back to the office, can you run a background check on the Mallums? See what we can find out. I'm gonna pay a visit to someone.\nJIM MALLUM: (returning to their apartment) Listen, you did the right thing out there. If it's happening again, no one can know. It puts us all at risk.\nEMILY MALLUM: Dad, I saw something else. On the bus. Something awful.\nJIM MALLUM: I'm sorry, Sweetie, but you know how this works. Even if you told 'em, would it make a difference? Remember what they did to you when we tried to help before? Trust me, okay? It's better this way.\nNINA SHARP: (on the phone) Of course. I'd certainly like to see the results for that. Sooner rather than later. Yeah, well, send them to me directly. (after the call) What a nice surprise. If I'd known you were coming, I would've cancelled my lunch.\nOLIVIA: Hi. (hugs) Uh, I'm actually here about Emily Mallum. Her father says that Massive Dynamic has been harassing her and her family.\nNINA SHARP: Oh, are you asking me a question, or are you accusing me of something?\nOLIVIA: Well, I thought you said that you were done using children as test subjects. (sits)\nNINA SHARP: Yes, we are. (sits) Massive Dynamic did approach the Mallum Family when they lived in Baltimore. Emily exhibited some fascinating Precog abilities that would've allowed us to make drastic advances in our study of the human brain. We simply wanted to catalog her abilities. Her father wasn't interested, even when we offered to pay for Emily's schooling.\nOLIVIA: I don't know how you could've raised me for so many years, and seen all the damage that was done to me, and pretend that there's nothing wrong with what you just said.\nNINA SHARP: Olivia, I am sorry. Now, what happened to you was awful. But this girl is different. No one made her this way.\nOLIVIA: I don't see the difference. I mean, it's still abuse. (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nEMILY MALLUM: (calling from the park) It's Emily. You said you wanted to help, Agent Dunham. Can you meet me?\nOLIVIA: (to Emily) Can you hold on one moment? (to Nina) I'm sorry, I have to go.\nOLIVIA: (meeting her at a quiet bench with a peaceful view) Emily? You picked a nice spot for us to meet.\nEMILY MALLUM: It reminds me of a place we used to live. A better time. I sometimes sneak out here to think. To clear my head.\nOLIVIA: Does your father know that you called me? (gets a shake of the head. no) So what did you want to tell me, Emily?\nEMILY MALLUM: I think a lot of people are gonna die. (reveals her latest drawing with mass casualties)\nEMILY MALLUM: (as she receives a quick medical once-over) It started when I was eleven. I was in a pet store with my mother. We were looking at puppies, when suddenly I heard this hum. I thought something was wrong with my ears, like you know how sometimes after you've flown in an airplane, but then, when we were leaving, the man behind the counter had a heart attack. I saw it in my mind before it happened.\nWALTER: That was the first time. How long before it happened again?\nEMILY MALLUM: A few months. I heard the hum during class, and an image popped into my head. My teacher lying dead in the street, covered in broken glass. Three days later, she got hit by a car. My parents took me to a doctor, but -- and then people started to do tests on me. And my friends heard about it.\nOLIVIA: And that's when people got scared? And then you moved.\nEMILY MALLUM: The first time. (as Astrid retrieves her EEG printout) But it kept happening.\nWALTER: Hmm. Fascinating. (about the readout) The Theta-One waves in your occipital lobe are remarkably active. And also, your brain seems to be drawing elevated levels of both oxygen and blood.\nPETER: Meaning what, Walter?\nWALTER: Belly and I always had a theory that some traumatic events echo backward in time. (animated) Put simply, some future events ripple backwards. Well, not in a way that we're consciously aware of, but it's sort of like vibrations. And perhaps your brain is uniquely sensitive to these vibrations. So it's possible that's the hum that you hear. Have you ever been able to control this ability?\nEMILY MALLUM: That's not how it works. These images I see... they're like dreams. At first they're vivid, but then they fade. That's why I draw them. But it wouldn't matter anyway. Whatever I see... somehow it always happens. (choked-up emotionally) I know all these people are gonna die, but there's nothing I can do to stop it.\nPETER: I don't understand, Emily. Why do you warn them if they can't do anything about it?\nEMILY MALLUM: I don't know. I guess if people knew, maybe they could say \"I love you\" to someone. Or just do one good thing.\nPETER: Maybe we can I.D. this man. She said she saw him on the bus.\nASTRID: I'll check the MBTA database. If he has a bus pass, they might have his photo. (gets busy on her desktop computer)\nOLIVIA: (privately) I haven't thanked you for calling. That must've been hard. Can I ask you a question? Are you sensing anything now? Like, here with me?\nJIM MALLUM: (hears the din associated with her vision) Emily.\nEMILY MALLUM: Dad.\nOLIVIA: We called him. We didn't want your parents to worry when you didn't come home.\nJIM MALLUM: Did they hurt you?\nOLIVIA: Mister Mallum... you don't need to worry about us.\nEMILY MALLUM: Even if we've never been able to stop it, let them at least try.\nPETER: We got something. Astrid found him. She got an address.\nASTRID: According to his bus pass, his name is Albert Duncan, he's got an apartment in Jamaica Plain. (hands her the data)\nOLIVIA: Let's go.\nPETER: And then what? Even if you can save Mister Duncan, what about the rest of the people in that drawing?\nAGENT LEE: I don't know. But we're certainly not gonna help anything by standing here.\nOLIVIA: (to Emily) Thank you. (leaves with Lee)\nJIM MALLUM: Can my daughter and I please go home now? If there's nothing more she can do for you.\nPETER: No, I think actually there is. Walter, I think you can hypnotize Emily to recover her vision of the event in that drawing.\nWALTER: (not familiar with that skillset) Wh \u2013 wh -- what makes you think I can do that?\nPETER: Because where I'm from, I've seen you do it before.\nBUILDING SUPER: (grants access to the apartment and follows the investigators in) So is Albert in some kind of trouble?\nAGENT LEE: We really don't know.\nBUILDING SUPER: (self-deprecating humor) Sure, I understand. I wouldn't tell me either.\nOLIVIA: Hey. Uh, Mister Duncan isn't home yet. He works construction. We called his boss, and apparently he's been away all week. How's it going there?\nASTRID: Walter's just getting started. (hangs-up as the hypnagogic device takes effect on Emily)\nWALTER: Emily, I'm going to count backwards from three. And when I reach one, I want you to open your eyes, and tell me where you are. Three... two... one. Where are you, Emily?\nEMILY MALLUM: (opens her eyes. visualizes her bus trip) On the bus. On the way home.\nWALTER: Do you see Mister Duncan?\nEMILY MALLUM: No. But I hear it. I hear the hum.\nWALTER: (guiding her vision) Look around, Emily. Find Mister Duncan.\nEMILY MALLUM: I see him. He's getting off the bus.\nPETER: Guide her, Walter, you can do this.\nWALTER: Uh -- um, Emily, listen... don't let Mister Duncan get away. You'll have to catch up with him. Can you do that?\nEMILY MALLUM: Yes.\nWALTER: Follow him, Emily. We need to know where he's going.\nJIM MALLUM: What is it?\nEMILY MALLUM: Oh, gawd. (as she strolls through the catastrophic vision she recent put to paper)\nWALTER: Where are you?\nEMILY MALLUM: I don't know. But it's bad. Oh, God. They're dead. They're all dead.\nWALTER: Look around, Emily. Describe what you see. Tell me where you are.\nEMILY MALLUM: (the body of a victim hangs in midair during a huge explosion) I'm scared.\nWALTER: There's nothing to be frightened of. Nothing can hurt you.\nPETER: You know what, Mister Mallum, maybe if she heard your voice, it might help her.\nJIM MALLUM: Sweetheart, it's me. Look around. Tell me what you see.\nEMILY MALLUM: I see something. It looks like Latin. \"dei judicium... fiat justitia.\"\nPETER: ...\"by the judgment of god, let justice be done.\"\nASTRID: (confirms) Mm-hmm.\nPETER: I need to borrow your phone, please.\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Dunham.\nPETER: It's me. It's a courthouse.\nOLIVIA: (to Lee) It's happening at a courthouse. Peter, Albert Duncan just got divorced. The settlement was last week. He lost custody of his kids. Maybe he's not so happy about it.\nWALTER: (to Emily) When I count to three, I want you to wake up.\nEMILY MALLUM: I see him. I see Mister Duncan. He's holding something. (steps closer in her vision) Some sort of weird-looking radio.\nPETER: I don't think it's a radio. I think it's a detonator. Duncan's not the victim. He must be setting up some sort of bomb.\n(Duncan makes his way into the judicial building. his detonator easily clears security)\n(Olivia and Lee arrive at the Allston Courthouse as the massive security response deploys into and around the building)\nTACTICAL TEAMS: Move, move, move! Go! Move!\nBROYLES: (to his agents) Courthouse Security Office pulled surveillance of Albert Duncan's vehicle entering the south entrance of the parking garage twenty minutes ago. We'll assume he's still in the building.\nAGENT LEE: What about the bomb?\nPETER: Given the amount of destruction in Emily's vision, we assume that he couldn't possibly have that amount of explosives strapped to his person.\nOLIVIA: The way Emily described it, it was as though the ground erupted.\nBROYLES: Right, so we'll assume the explosive is in the parking garage beneath the building. Bomb squad's about to go in and look for it. Peter's gonna join them.\nAGENT LEE: I can help.\nBOMB TECHNICIAN: (to Broyles) Sir, we're ready.\nBROYLES: (to Lee) Go. We'll start evacuating the building.\nEMILY MALLUM: Dad, I'm sorry. Calling the FBI, I know I should've told you.\nJIM MALLUM: (returning to the apartment) That's okay, Sweetheart. I'm just really proud of you. But you're in the system now. You know, so it's only a matter of time before people start showing-up --\nEMILY MALLUM: No. They're not like that. Agent Dunham promised. She said no one would harass us anymore.\nJIM MALLUM: (sees a menacing van down the street) Come on, let's get in the house, Em.\nEMILY MALLUM: Dad.\nJIM MALLUM: This isn't a discussion. Go pack your bags. (calling-out) Diane!\nEMILY MALLUM: Dad, please.\nDIANE MALLUM: What? What is it?\nJIM MALLUM: Black van across the street. Just like the one in Baltimore.\nDIANE MALLUM: Do what your father says.\nJIM MALLUM: (to Diane) I need a pen. I want to write down the license plate.\n(Emily starts packing, then closes her door so she can sit and sketch one final image)\nALBERT DUNCAN: (stepping from the elevator) Uh, excuse me. I'm looking for Judge O'Malley.\nCOURT CLERK: The Judge is in chambers. Do you have an appointment?\nALBERT DUNCAN: Uh, no, but um...\nLOUDSPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen, due to a reported emergency, please proceed immediately to the nearest exit. Please remain calm, and obey the instructions of the court officers.\nCANINE HANDLER: (to his furry, four-footed partner) What do you got, boy? What do you got?\nBOMB SQUAD: 26 and 28 are clear. What about the wheelwell?\nAGENT LEE: (to all in earshot) Hey, I got it! (approaches the pick-up truck. bomb technicians approach and uncover the payload. the shear volume of explosives makes everyone gulp)\nOLIVIA: (upstairs. briefing an officer) If you see him, I don't want you to confront him. Just keep your eyes on him, and you can either let Agent Broyles or myself know.\nCOURT OFFICER: Okay.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nPETER: (on radio) It's me. We were right. It's rigged up to some sort of remote detonation trigger.\nBROYLES: Well, how long will it take to disarm?\nPETER: They don't know yet, but it's pretty elaborate.\nBROYLES: Okay, keep me informed.\nPETER: Will do.\nOLIVIA: They found the bomb?\nBROYLES: This thing goes off, we're gonna need to clear a 200-meter blast radius. Maybe you should help the police set up a perimeter.\nOLIVIA: I know what you're doing, and I'm not going anywhere.\nBROYLES: Olivia... what that man said to you... that you're gonna die... maybe this is what he was talking about.\nOLIVIA: (refusing the paradigm) I can't live my life like that. Or do my job.\nBOMB TECHNICIAN: (in the garage There's no reason for you guys to be here. This thing's wired with multiple redundancies. Could take hours. That guy could remote-trigger the device any time.\nPETER: (has a novel idea) Hey, can you tell me what frequency that bomb is rigged to receive?\nBOMB TECHNICIAN: Probably. Yeah, why? What are you thinking?\nPETER: Hey, it's me again. Have everybody turn their radios to 432.5 megahertz.\nALBERT DUNCAN: (intercepts his target amid the evacuees) Hey. Hey, Judge O'Malley! You don't even know who I am.\nO'MALLEY: No, no. Should I?\nALBERT DUNCAN: (finger in face) You took my family from me. And I'm gonna take you away from yours.\nBROYLES: It's over, Mister Duncan. We blocked your signal.\nOLIVIA: Nobody wants to hurt you, so you can just put your hands up, and we'll just walk out of here.\nALBERT DUNCAN: No. (drops detonator) Nobody's going anywhere. (reveals bomb strapped to his torso)\nOLIVIA: Albert, you do not want to do this. Don't.\nALBERT DUNCAN: (holds up deadman trigger) He... he took everything from me.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I understand why you're upset. But you can't do this. You can't. Albert...\nALBERT DUNCAN: This is not my fault. This is because of him. And this is how it has to end.\nOLIVIA: No, you're wrong. Nothing has to happen. Nothing is written in stone. (calmly) You and I -- we don't have to die here today. Now, whatever happens next is up to you. You are in control. (waits for him to digest the thought) I'm not ready to die today. I don't think that you are either. (waits again) Just think about all these people. They have children too.\nJIM MALLUM: (his answering machine takes the call while he packs and listens) We're not home. Please leave a message.\nOLIVIA: (leaves a message) Uh, Mister Mallum, this is Olivia Dunham. We defused the bomb. A lot of people's lives were saved today. I thought Emily would like to know.\nJIM MALLUM: (looking for his teenager) Hey, Em. (panics when he can't find her. the suspicious van is gone too)\nDIANE MALLUM: Jim? Jim, what is it?\nJIM MALLUM: They took her. They took Emily.\nBROYLES: (on the phone to his agents still working the courthouse crime scene) We traced the plate number Jim Mallum provided. Boston PD hailed it. It was just a dry-cleaning van.\nAGENT LEE: Thanks for letting us know. (hangs-up. to Olivia) Her father was wrong.\nOLIVIA: I think he was just being paranoid. I don't think Emily was abducted at all.\nAGENT LEE: Then where the hell is she?\nOLIVIA: I think I might know. (drives to the park where she met the teen) Emily! Emily! (runs to the bench) You're freezing cold. We have to get you out of here. Her pulse is weak.\nAGENT LEE: I'll call the ambulance.\nOLIVIA: Help's on its way.\nEMILY MALLUM: It doesn't matter. (assigned to her fate) There's nothing anyone can do. It's just my time.\nAGENT LEE: This is Agent Lincoln Lee. I need an ambulance at Tanner Park right away.\nOLIVIA: No, Emily, you told me what's in your drawings is inevitable. But you're wrong. Today we saved all of those people because of you.\nJIM MALLUM: (approaches) Emily. (sees her weakened state) Oh, God. Emily...\nEMILY MALLUM: I've known for a while.\nJIM MALLUM: Why didn't you tell me?\nEMILY MALLUM: I knew you'd be here.\nJIM MALLUM: Em, please. They're on their way. Can you just hold on?\nEMILY MALLUM: I think you were right. Everyone has a purpose. They saved those people today. Maybe that was mine. (blood trickles from her nose as she leaves this life)\nPETER: (enters the lab) Hey.\nOLIVIA: (looks up from her pile of work) Hey.\nPETER: They told me what happened with the girl. I'm really sorry. They said it was some kind of stroke.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. The overload of electrical activity in her brain was just too much.\nPETER: So the very thing that gave her ability...\nOLIVIA: ...also killed her. Walter said that even if we'd known, we couldn't have done anything to prevent it. (thinks) He says, \"a candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long.\"\nPETER: I'm guessing you're not finding that all that comforting right now.\nOLIVIA: No, not as much as he does.\nPETER: (looks at photo on desk) Is that an Observer?\nOLIVIA: Is that what you call them?\nPETER: Yeah, why? What do you call 'em?\nOLIVIA: Well, up until now we haven't called them anything.\nPETER: Things really are different here.\nOLIVIA: What do you know?\nPETER: Well, they show up at significant events all through history.\nOLIVIA: Well, how do they do that? Like some kind of time travel?\nPETER: No, it's not really time travel, per se. Uh, it's more like they exist in all times simultaneously. They don't experience time the same way that you and I do.\nOLIVIA: So they know what's going to happen. I mean, if one of them said something about the future... could they be wrong?\nPETER: Well, no, I don't really see how they could. They don't predict the future, Olivia. They've already experienced it. Did one of them make contact with you? Have they reached out?\nOLIVIA: (spares him her concern) No.\nNINA SHARP: (after knocking) I hope it's not too late.\nOLIVIA: No, I, uh... I just got home. Come in.\nNINA SHARP: I wanted to see you. Especially after I spoke with Phillip. He told me what happened to the girl. Are you alright?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I'm fine. Really, I \u2013 I \u2013 I -- I am okay. (both sit on the couch)\nNINA SHARP: Sweetheart, about what you said when you came to see me this afternoon... I never should've reacted the way that I did.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, I should not have accused you.\nNINA SHARP: Please, I - I'm the one that needs to apologize. What happened to you as a child was unconscionable. You've come so far, I just forget sometimes how much you've been expected to forgive.\nOLIVIA: I'm not angry with you. I thought I was going to die today. And one of the things that I kept thinking was that you -- you wouldn't know how I felt. You're the closest thing I have to a mother. And I love you.\nNINA SHARP: Oh, Olive... (sees her wince) What? What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: I've just been getting these migraines, that's all. It's really not that big of a deal.\nNINA SHARP: Well, do you have any medicine?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, my doctor gave me some.\nNINA SHARP: Good. And what about food? Have you eaten?\nOLIVIA: No.\nNINA SHARP: I'm going to make you some soup. (heads to the kitchen)\nOLIVIA: You know, y-- you don't have to do that.\nNINA SHARP: I want to. I'm the closest thing you have to a mother. Remember.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. That would be great.\nNINA SHARP: Tomorrow I'm going to send some medication over. It's a new drug we've been working on. It's remarkable. (gets busy cooking)\n(on the street outside the apartment, a bald man in a Fedora waits and watches)"

And with radiation, this type of carcinoma is ninety-five percent treatable. Ninety-five percent survivable, Chet. That's better odds than you got driving up the Mass Pike. I've known you what, twenty years? We're going to get through this.\n(the cancer sufferer sits at a bus stop. deflated. thinking. another rider has a seat)\nNEIL CHUNG: Tissue connectivity. That's what goes last.\nCHET WILLIAMS: (not understanding why this stranger is addressing him) I'm sorry?\nNEIL CHUNG: First, there's the cure -- radiation. It makes you sick, weak. But it doesn't work. Not this time, not in your case. The cancer has multiplied. They try Chemo, but the cell replication rate is just too high. Your bones hurt. They ache. They burn. Renal failure comes next. And soon, you lose all mobility below the waist. Impotence, incontinence, and finally, full respiratory failure. All from one... tiny mole.\nCHET WILLIAMS: (defensive) Doctor told me I have a ninety-five percent chance.\nNEIL CHUNG: (as the bus arrives) You're the other five percent. (after it departs, Chet lays dead on the bench)\n(from the parallel universe, Agent Farnsworth makes her way through security in uniform, and unauthorized passage across the trans-universal bridge)\nSCANNING DEVICE: (as she stops on the scanning grid) Initiate scan.\nMILITARY SENTRY: (after she places her hand on the biometric monitor) Welcome, Agent. (Farnsworth steps through the outside doors and sees a very different Lady Liberty than the one she is accustomed to seeing)\nLINCOLN LEE: (reporting to the boss at his desk) You wanted to see us, Colonel?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: (stands) The bridge was activated an hour ago. An agent crossed over to the other side without any mission imperative.\nLINCOLN LEE: Who was it?\nBOLIVIA: Are you suggesting that somebody defected?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I can't imagine. It was Agent Farnsworth.\nLINCOLN LEE: That's impossible. (missing the obvious) Who -- who gave her clearance?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: She did. Agent Farnsworth has the same security clearance as any senior Fringe Agent. In fact, she's responsible for processing transit papers and clearance. It just never occurred to us...\nBOLIVIA: ...that she would use it for herself.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Correct.\nLINCOLN LEE: What's she doing over there?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: We don't know. She went off the grid immediately after crossing over. (deep breath) Alright. Let's send a team of agents to retrieve her.\nBOLIVIA: (has a better idea) No, she must've had a reason. Astrid doesn't do anything without a reason, and after the day she's had, I got a hunch where she's headed. I'll go get her. (heads for the door)\nWALTER: (sitting at a work station across from Peter. consumed in food fantasy) What would you say to some eggs? I had a marvellus dream last night in which eggs played a prominent part. (smiles)\nPETER: (frustrated) I would say... that we've only been working for three hours, and we've already taken two food breaks. At this rate, I'll never get home.\nWALTER: I miss the other one.\nPETER: I'm almost afraid to ask.\nWALTER: Boy. The other boy. He doesn't starve me.\nPETER: Which other boy?\nWALTER: The one who plays chess.\nPETER: Lincoln?\nWALTER: (unknowingly rude) That's the one. I prefer him. (walks over to chessboard)\nPETER: Well, Lincoln's not here, Walter. He's in Hartford. It's his god-daughter's birthday. Remember? And I\u2019d be happy to play with you after we finish our work.\nWALTER: (knowingly rude) Frankly, I don't think you'd be much of a challenge.\nPETER: (getting back on task) I got a challenge for \u2018ya. Why don't we fix the machine? (walks away)\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (enters from the corridor) Hello.\nWALTER: (respond to the familiar voice) Hello. How about you and I share some delightful scrambled eggs, Astro?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (monotone) It's Astrid.\nWALTER: That's funny. You never correct me. (turns around and sees he is not conversing with his Agent Farnsworth) You're not you, are you?\nASTRID: (enters the lab with Olivia) I don't think what he meant was \"I'll call you.\" I think what he meant was \"I'll never call you.\"\nOLIVIA: (sees Agent Farnsworth) Hello.\nASTRID: (glances up at her counterpart) Aah!\nPETER: (walks from the back room) What happened?\nOLIVIA: (witty. to Astrid) I always wondered why nobody does that. (to Farnsworth) What are you doing here, Agent?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I came here to meet her. (her counterpart)\nASTRID: Hi. (holds her new friend's hands)\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Hello.\nASTRID: Olivia told me about you. But it's nice to meet you personally in the flesh.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (deadpan) All personal meetings are in the flesh.\nASTRID: (appreciates the unintentional humor) Yes, I - I suppose they are.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (reels off the facts) I thought I would come here. I didn't know where to go after. Mother might have had traditions for such occasions, but I don't know. I don't remember her. My mother died of cancer when I was a girl. Did yours as well?\nASTRID: Yes.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: At first I thought I would walk in the park. But it was so cold. And I could not stop thinking about the words Reverend Stewart said. (emphatic) What a leader he was, a great man, a great friend. Reverend Stewart said he would be sorely missed. And they lowered the box down into the ground, and we put down flowers. (emotional swell) And I didn't know where to go. Because the park was so cold. May I ask you a question? Yours -- did you love him?\nOLIVIA: Astrid... what's going on?\nASTRID: (deciphering the flood of information) I think my f \u2014 (rethinks before misspeaking) I - I think her father is dead.\nOLIVIA: (answers ringing cell phone) Dunham.\nWALTER: Perhaps y - you would both like to join me in a plate of eggs. W - with chives.\nPETER: Walter, now is not the time.\nWALTER: Nonsense. N - nearly all cultures react to death with food.\nOLIVIA: Okay, uh, we just caught a case. And my double's on her way here to -- to sort this out.\nWALTER: (enraged) Olivia! The Viper?\nASTRID: Walter!\nWALTER: What? (grumbles) I know. D\u00e9tente. That's not to say I have to like her.\nOLIVIA: (logistics consideration) Do you think that one of us should wait here with \u2013\nWALTER: (adamant) No, there's no need. We will be fine. Astrid and I -\nASTRID: (disbelief) -- Really!? You get her name right?\nWALTER: Astrid and I can wait here alone. (to Farnsworth) Can't we, Dear? (taunting Peter) I'm sure she'll be great company.\nBROYLES: (inside the crime tape as his Science Team gets set up) Boston Police found the body at nine-thirty this morning. He was coming home from his doctor's office. Less than six hours ago, Chet Williams was diagnosed with Stage One melanoma.\nWALTER: (from the lab as he monitors via Astrid's videophone) Stage One. That has a survival rate of ninety-five percent. (to Agent Farnsworth) And that's without introducing even one frog rectally to slow cell division.\nASTRID: (about the frog comment) What?\nOLIVIA: What? (about Astrid's private conversation)\nASTRID: Nothing. (you don't want to know)\nPETER: (notes dried blood around the corpses eyes) So what are these? Bad mascara day?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019d say bad day all around. I mean, can -- can someone actually cry blood?\nWALTER: Rarely. Certain viruses -- Ebola, say -- can cause bleeding from the tear ducts, but only after most of the organs are liquefied. Check his crotch.\nASTRID: (not wanting to hear again what she thought she'd heard) I'm -- I'm sorry?\nWALTER: Don't be a prude. (Astrid lifts the corpses' clothing so Walter can clearly see back in the lab) Oh, you (to Farnsworth. watching over his shoulder) -- you see? There's no bleeding from the urethra. So I would say his organs are not liquefied.\nASTRID: Okay, good news. Walter says that his organs haven't liquefied.\nPETER: So then what else could cause this?\nWALTER: Nothing. Nothing real, at least. There is a - a legendary alchemical mixture \u2014 a \u2013 a potion, as it were -- called the Tears Of Ra. Egyptians used it to euthanize beloved pets so that they could be buried with their owners who pre-deceased them. But it's just a myth. Well, bring the body back to the lab. And -- and also, I\u2019d like some vanilla ice cream. Kirk out. (exulted. cuts the connection)\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (summarizes what she just saw) You talk through her. You're Astrid. You talk through her. As if you were one person.\nWALTER: Yes, you could say it that way.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: It must be pleasant.\nWALTER: (delighted with the new perspective on his relationship) Yes. I suppose it is.\nPETER: (to the forensics crew with the corpse) Thanks. You can follow us back to the lab.\nBROYLES: (busy on his cell phone) Yeah. Alright, keep me posted. Right.\n(as the corpse is gurneyed away, an Observer steps through a trans-dimensional portal temporarily embedded in one of the large front windows of a nearby business. he makes a quick assessment, then communicates it on his handheld device before vanishing back through the temporal doorway)\nMARCH: I think we have located it.\nASTRID: (reads scale after Peter places autopsied organ on it) Point-two-six pounds.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (shotguns random datapoint) Seventeen percent lighter than an average human kidney.\nOLIVIA: (reads initial research) Okay, Chet Williams. Thirty-eight years old. Manufactures consumer goods overseas. Uh, single... no debt... no drug issues. His friends say that he's a nice guy.\nASTRID: So nobody someone would want to kill?\nPETER: Well, everybody has somebody who wants to kill them.\nWALTER: (eyes down into microscope) And voil\u00e0. The deadly culprit reveals itself. (thinks) Odd.\nPETER: Always makes me nervous when he says that.\nWALTER: (to Farnsworth) An interaction of chemical compounds I've not seen before. (summons Astrid) Aspirin... (to all) predictive sciences says that these compounds shouldn't interact, but they do.\nOLIVIA: So what, you're saying that it's magic?\nWALTER: It's science. Just unusual science. Huh. (to Farnsworth) The way that six different alcohols create a flavor identical to iced tea.\nPETER: (quiet snark) Amen to that.\nWALTER: It works, but no one could've predicted it would work.\nOLIVIA: So you're saying that he was killed by a poison that no one invented?\nPETER: It should go without saying, but that's impossible.\nWALTER: (bitter) I think we're aware of that, Peter.\n(Bolivia enters the lab)\nBOLIVIA: (chipper) Oh. Isn't this a party? Hey, girls.\nWALTER: (to Bolivia) Mata Hari. (irate) Deceived and betrayed anyone yet today? It is almost lunchtime, after all.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (abruptly) Deus Ex Machina.\nWALTER: (suddenly interested) The Hand Of God?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: The interaction of the chemicals in the poison is not predictable. The creation of the toxin requires the assumption that these compounds can intermingle, and in fact, these compounds do not intermingle -- except when they are all mixed together, they do, which is a completely unpredictable event.\nPETER: (postulating what he just thought he heard) Okay, just so I'm clear -- you're saying that a person would have to -- see that the chemicals had already been combined in order to know how to combine them?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, and the chances of that occurring randomly are less than one tenth of one percent. Therefore, there is a root of the equation that is outside our realm of causality. Deus Ex Machina. The Hand Of God.\nPETER: (to Farnsworth) But Astrid, are you trying to tell us that God taught our Perp how to mix a mythical poison?\nWALTER: God... or godlike powers. (delighted when he makes the connection that Farnsworth was alluding to) It -- it's the only thing that makes sense. Come with me. I'll need your help to identify the origin of these component compounds. (escorts her from his work station. to those he left on the main floor) I think I love her.\nBOLIVIA: Okay, well, I guess that, uh, we're not gonna go straight home. (makes herself at home) Cold Chinese in the fridge?\nPETER: Uh, yeah. I'll check. (heads to the refrigerator. the two Olivia's make uncomfortable eye contact)\nCLERK: (in an inner city liquor store, a pint-size bottle of gin is sold and bagged for the customer) Here you go.\n(Carrie Watson leaves the store with her gin, then considers discarding her hasty purchase when she approaches a public trash can. willing to make an effort to conquer her addiction, the gin is not going home with her this day. with today's victory under her belt, she continues into a breezeway between buildings)\nNEIL CHUNG: (timing his arrival behind her, he jumps into the conversation she was having with herself) You're putting up a good fight. But you're not going to win. (as she turns to face the man claiming prophecy in her life) You're gonna take that drink, and from there it's all downhill. But you know the saddest part? (disinterested, she walks away) The drinking doesn't kill you. Instead, it shatters the lives of everyone around you. Everyone you love. (places time-viewing device in his pocket) Your boyfriend is going to be killed in a car accident with you behind the wheel. (she turns to him as the words slowly sink-in) Your brother is going to alienate his wife and daughter, throw away his own future trying to rescue you. But he fails.\nCARRIE WATSON: (dismissive) No one can see the future.\nNEIL CHUNG: You're right. (grabs her arm) There is no future. There's no past. Everything happens right now. (takes atomizer and sprays it into his target's face)\nWALTER: (empties out a shopping bag with a few dozen personal items. aggressive distrust) Now that you're back, I can finally rid myself of this junk you left behind in your haste to slink away.\nBOLIVIA: (laughs. checks out the stuff left behind) Walter, you've been holding onto this stuff all this time?\nWALTER: (feeling accused) I didn't steal anything, if that's what you're implying. (less rudely) Although I admit that this one item confounded me. (picks-up and examines a small silver box. sensing conspiracy) Just another of your tools of spy craft, I imagine. A sinister communication device? Some kind of devious encoder?\nBOLIVIA: Wow. (teasing) I really got to you, didn't I, Walter? Did you ever consider that perhaps it's because you enjoyed having me around? Admit it. (provocateur) You like me, Walter.\nASTRID: (on videophone from crime scene) Walter, we're setting up.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Doctor Bishop. (to the distracted scientist) Doctor Bishop, your Astrid is summoning you. The Fringe Team is at the scene.\nFORENSIC TECHNICIAN: (briefing the science team in the breezeway) The way this woman died -- and I say this with some experience -- is among the weirdest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\nPETER: She bleeding from her eyes?\nFORENSIC TECHNICIAN: How did you know?\nPETER: There seems to be a lot of that going around lately. You mind opening it up? I\u2019d love to take a look.\nWALTER: (issues his needs over the comm link) Astrix, collect a DNA sample.\nPETER: Astrid, can you hand me a cotton swab?\nASTRID: (more focused on aiding Peter) Hang on, Walter.\nPETER: (unwittingly supersedes Walter's traditional expertise) I wanna get a DNA sample.\nOLIVIA: (approaches the corpse) So the cops said...\nPETER: (busy at work) ...hang on a second. Seems to be some hemorrhaging of the nasal passage.\nOLIVIA: You think maybe she inhaled something?\nPETER: Yeah, possibly. Could be how they delivered the poison.\nASTRID: (has to time now for his input) I'm sorry, Walter. What were you saying?\nWALTER: (feelingly outsourced) Doesn't matter. But please ask Agent Dunham to bring the body \u2013\nPETER: (supersedes Walter's input again. unknowingly) Astrid, we're gonna need to get this body back to the lab to have it examined. Can you work that out with the M.E.'s office?\nASTRID: Yeah.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (painfully candid. unintentionally) Does he always do all the jobs?\n(Walter kills the video feed after his ego has been sufficiently bruised)\nWALTER: (classical music plays as Peter works diligently at a lab station over the corpse. set on belittlement) These scalpels could use some sharpening.\nPETER: (accepts the tray of scalpels) And you're sharing that with me why?\nWALTER: I thought you'd sharpen them for me. You said you wanted to help.\nPETER: I had meant with the autopsy, Walter.\nWALTER: (snaps his gloves) The screws in the rib-spreader could also use a little tightening. (Peter walks away. let's the former alpha-dog have his moment)\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (direct. candid) You're angry with your son.\nWALTER: He is not my son.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: As I understand it, in a different timeline, he is.\nWALTER: Oh, so he says.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Do you feel love for him? I have found that anger inevitably seems to be conjoined with emotional investment. (succinct) Do you think that is the case?\nWALTER: (equally succinct) Peter is a reminder of the son I had... and wish had lived. But he is not that son.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (not understanding the complex circumstances Walter fancies as truth) And that makes you suffer?\nWALTER: Yes.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (selecting the least complex course for resolution) In that case, wouldn't it be preferable if you chose to believe he was your son? And then you could love him and be happy. (Walter ponders the concept. speechless)\nBOLIVIA: (working in Olivia's office. examining research) I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing any connection between the victims. (studies Peter in the adjoining office) Secretary's son. He's cute, huh? Bet he's all contradictory and tricky like his Dad.\nOLIVIA: (aloof. barbed) Yeah, I imagine he's just your type.\nBOLIVIA: Actually, no. (curt) Turns out I like the nice guys. (looks around at the casework) Alright, so neither of the victims lived in the same neighborhood. They didn't go to the same gym, and they\u2019ve got no mutual friends.\nOLIVIA: (focused) Yeah, well, there has to be a connection. We just haven't found it yet.\nBOLIVIA: (pretentious) You say that with such conviction. Because...?\nOLIVIA: (displaying her superior investigative skills. politely) Because if there isn't a link, then we've got a killer on the loose and no lead to find him.\nPUBLIC ADDRESS: Flight 28 to San Antonio is now boarding at Gate 38-B. Flight 28 to San Antonio is now boarding at gate 38-B.\nNEIL CHUNG: (takes passenger's ID card, scans it against the blue rod, then gives it back) Have a nice flight.\nJARED COLIN: Look, Honey, I'm at the security thing. I\u2019ve gotta call you back, okay?\nNEIL CHUNG: (scans the ID and it glows bright, then hands it back) Have a nice flight.\nJARED COLIN: Thanks.\n(Chung writes down the passenger's name, then waves the next passenger forward)\nJARED COLIN: (arguing on cell phone as he heads for his car) Look, take it down a notch, okay? Yeah, yeah, I want to get this over with, too. What? No, no. It's not a ruse. I told you, I missed the flight this morning. There's nothing I can do. Bill, Bill. Listen to me. I'm hanging up the phone right now. Call me back when you get a personality I can deal with. (ends call. starts another cell call. to Chung as he approaches) Can I help you?\nNEIL CHUNG: Making your next call will destroy your life.\nJARED COLIN: Excuse me?\nNEIL CHUNG: You'll be driving. When a taxi cuts you off, your reaction won't be quick enough because you only have one hand on the wheel.\nJARED COLIN: (dismissing the crazy) Oh, okay. Well, thanks, pal. But my life really is none of your business.\nNEIL CHUNG: (itemizing future events) Your car is going to flip, shattering your spinal cord. You're left a paraplegic, and with no family, you end up in a group home. (places advanced technology in his pocket) The man who runs it is not... kind. Your body will be discovered more than ten hours after you die. No one mourns. I'm going to spare you from all that misery. A painless exit from a living nightmare. (removes atomizer. starts to aim but is blocked. the victim evades him, but is struck hard by a speeding car}\nOLIVIA: (to Peter as they find the Intensive Care duty desk) Jared Colin. Apparently, his attacker tried to spray him with some kind of atomizer.\nPETER: Yeah, that sounds like our guy.\nOLIVIA: He said he'd never seen the man before, so why? What's his motive?\nDOCTOR BRODY: (flirty fun) Hm. The Feds, I take it? Too many years in this job. Lawyers and Cops -- I can spot you guys a mile away.\nOLIVIA: Uh, I'm Agent Olivia Dunham, and this is Peter Bishop. What can you tell us about Mister Colin, Doctor?\nDOCTOR BRODY: Well, it's not good news. I mean, we saved his life, but his spinal cord is severed right below T-1, so he is not gonna walk again. Come on. He's down here. (starts down the hall)\nJARED COLIN: (awake. tired. wearing a cranial brace) I wasn't even supposed to be in town. I was heading down to Dallas. Selling my company to my scumbag partner, who for six years has made my life a living hell. Today was gonna be the day that I started over. New beginning. But I had a water bottle in my carry-on. By the time the damn TSA was done with me, I missed my flight.\nOLIVIA: Besides his description, is there anything else that you can tell us? Anything that you remember?\nJARED COLIN: He, uh... he had this weird rod. It was blue. And he'd look into it like he was some kind of fortune teller. He said I was gonna have a car accident, and I was gonna end up like this.\nPETER: So this guy predicted what would happen?\nJARED COLIN: Not exactly, but I guess exactly doesn't really matter now.\nOLIVIA: We think it's possible that the man who attacked you also killed at least another two people. (holds-up their photos) Do you recognize either of them?\nJARED COLIN: No. He... he said he wanted to put me out of my misery. Like he was doing a good deed. Like he was some kind of Saint. I tell ya, I wish he had. I wish he'd done it. I wish he'd killed me.\nASTRID: (looking at the victim's photo) Nothing to link them. Period.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (parroting) Period.\nASTRID\/AGENT FARNSWORTH: (in unison) Goose egg.\nASTRID\/AGENT FARNSWORTH: (in unison) Zilch.\nASTRID: (smiles) Would you like a cup of coffee? I'm going to make a fresh pot.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Coffee. I understand that has quite an interesting flavor.\nASTRID: Yeah, I suppose it does. Have you never had any?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Where I come from, coffee is very rare and thus very expensive. I\u2019ve never had the privilege. (awkwardly congenial) Yes, I would like that. Thank you, Astrid.\nASTRID: You're welcome, Sweetie. (rolls her eyes as she walks away)\nWALTER: (at the other end of the lab. one of his guest attempts to sneak a piece licorice while he rests his eyes) Did you ask? I didn't hear you ask.\nBOLIVIA: (turns-on the charm) May I?\nWALTER: Certainly (opens his eyes) - not.\nBOLIVIA: (puts jar down) That's right. (sing-song) You're still mad at me.\nWALTER: Yes, and now you're breaking my concentration as well.\nBOLIVIA: Oh, I'm sorry. (sits down. sarcastically) Were you solving world hunger or perfecting the perfect peanut butter milkshake? (laughs)\nWALTER: (not buying into the charm) If you must know, I was musing on our killer. Agent Dunham reports that he may be attempting to put his victims out of their misery, and if that's the case, then his murder weapon of choice is consistent.\nASTRID: The Tears Of Ra?\nWALTER: Yes. Painless and instantaneous. And it begins to make sense now.\nASTRID: So we're looking for -- for what? A humanitarian killer?\nWALTER: Or a compassionate one.\nBOLIVIA: (seeking clarification) Okay, so you're saying that the killer believes he is saving his victims from a lifetime of suffering by killing them. That sounds like an extremely contorted view of compassion.\nWALTER: (altruistic) Some suffering is worse than death.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (looks up from recent research) What is Logan International?\nWALTER: It's an airport. Why?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: All three victims traveled through there.\nWALTER: Is that right? (to Astrid. disappointed) How did you miss that?\nASTRID: (defensive) I didn't! They all had different airlines. They had different destinations. Mister Williams was what, two weeks ago? Carrie Watson was last month.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, their travel vouchers indicate that. What is TSA?\nASTRID: Uh, Transportation Security Administration. They screen every passenger for safety.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: In that case, correlating their voucher stamps, I believe they may each have been screened by the same Security Agent.(hands the data to Astrid)\nASTRID: She's right. TSA Badge 0-0-4-7.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (looks to Astrid after tasting her cup of rare and exotic coffee. with considerable pleasure) My.\nNEIL CHUNG: (to passenger) Thank you. Have a nice flight.\nPUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT: ...ready for departure at Gate 23-A. All passengers should now be on board. Flight 62, Chicago O'Hare at Gate 23-A. (Peter makes predatory eye contact with Chung)\nPETER: (as Chung flees behind a wall of terminal security and fellow agents) Hey. Stop that man!\nTSA SCREENER: Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop right there! (physically barricades the duo)\nOLIVIA: (attempting to circumvent the security serpentine) Federal Agents. We're in pursuit of a suspect.\nTSA SCREENER: (standing his ground) Federal Regulations. You either have a boarding pass or supervised authorization. (offering what little help he is authorized to offer in the time-critical situation) Do you want me to find you a Supervisor?\nPROFESSOR: (busy finishing with his paperwork after class) I was surprised the FBI was doing a background check on Neil.\nOLIVIA: Well, to be honest, we were surprised to learn that he was previously employed as a professor at MIT.\nPROFESSOR: Yeah, I could tell that on the phone.\nPETER: So how does an advanced mathematics professor end-up working for the TSA?\nPROFESSOR: I suppose he loses his mind. (moves to the briefing lectern) It would be an understatement to say that people around here are driven, but Neil -- he put 'em all to shame. He was the youngest tenure track professor ever. Brilliant. And a little bit mad to begin with, I suppose. And like most mathematicians, he believed that math was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. I know how that sounds.\nPETER: Not nearly as crazy as you might think.\nPROFESSOR: Well, a couple years ago, he came back from summer break at his lake house, and he was just... changed. He said that he'd found something, although he wouldn't say what. But he'd become obsessed with these high-level differential equations that no one could make heads or tails of. He had a theory that if he could solve the equations, space and time could be flattened, so they would all be on a level plane.\nPETER: Define that for me what do you mean by flattened?\nPROFESSOR: Well, that you could in essence see past, present, and future simultaneously. Well, eventually, solving the equations became more important than class, and soon, he just left and didn't come back. Now, from what I heard, he went back to the lake house. But this working at the TSA? Now, that surprises me.\nPETER: Where was that lake house?\nPROFESSOR: I'm not sure, somewhere in Eastern New York, I think. He wanted his mail forwarded. Oh, here we are.(checks Chung's file) Reiden Lake.\nOLIVIA: (returning to the car) When you first appeared in this timeline, it was at Reiden Lake. What's going on, Peter?\nPETER: The professor said that Neil thought he could see past, present, and future all at the same time. That's what the Observers do. We've just never been able to figure out how they do it. But in my timeline, an Observer saved my life. It also happened at Reiden Lake. (as Olivia unplugs the electric car) When Walter crossed over when I was a child to bring me back to his universe, the ice broke. We both fell in. It was an Observer who pulled us out.\nOLIVIA: Are you suggesting that an Observer is somehow behind this? That -- that he's using Neil?\nPETER: I don't know. I think we should take a drive. (both buckle-in and drive off)\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (about Walter sitting with his eyes closed and wearing headphones) What's he doing?\nASTRID: Thinking.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: You care for him.\nASTRID: (candidly) I suppose I do, yeah.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Like a father. My father... (saddens) I cannot get the thought out of my mind that... that I couldn't give him what he wanted because of the way that I am. (frustrated) That he secretly wished I could love him back in a way that he could understand. (curious for a post mortem solution) Do you think if I were more like you, he would've loved me more? If I was normal? (gets choked-up. purges the emotion five seconds after she felt it) I think I would prefer this beverage with sugar. (gets-up to find the sugar. the emotional impact on Astrid weighs heavy)\nOLIVIA: (after the four drive to Reiden Lake from MIT, she parks in front of the Chung cabin, then takes less than a minute to pick the lock. humorously about the lock she just unlocked) Who leaves their door unlocked when they're not home?\nPETER: (perpetuating the joke) You're right. It's not safe. (follows her into the house)\nOLIVIA: (after looking, holsters her weapon) Well, we're in the right place.\nPETER: Hey, take a look at this. (the wall covered with religious, spiritual and other personal pictures, clippings, notes and memorabilia) Neil was a twin. His brother and father were killed in an accident. (about the assembled icons) So Gandhi, Joan of Arc, all the rest of them -- what's the connection? They're heroes?\nOLIVIA: (knowing the answer to her own question) What else do they all have in common? (gives him a few seconds) They're all saviors.\nPETER: So where is Neil? (she answers his question by handing him a photo of Neil - with his mom)\n(Neil Chung opens the safe in his closet and places the time-viewing device inside. he remove a pistol, loads it, then joins his mother in the living room)\nANNE CHUNG: Where are you going? (as he checks the front of the house) I don't understand. (as Neil waits for his future to arrive) What do you mean, you are here to say good-bye?\nANNE CHUNG: (sitting calmly) Where are you going?\nNEIL CHUNG: I told you.\nANNE CHUNG: \"Where I belong\" is not an answer. Were you fired again?\nNEIL CHUNG: I told you, Mom. I wasn't fired from MIT. I left. (approaches her)\nANNE CHUNG: What?\nNEIL CHUNG: (resentful) I heard you that night, you know. The night Alex died. (Anne stares at him, aghast) You said God took the wrong one. \"Why did God take my angel?\", you kept saying. You always resented that I wasn't Alex. Not your angel. I was afraid that you were right. That I would never be good enough. As good as he was. (Anne is disturbed) But God had a plan. He let me live for a reason. I know that now. God gave me a way to see the future.\nANNE CHUNG: W - what are you talk-\nNEIL CHUNG: (finishes the sentence) What are you talking about?\nNEIL\/ANNE: Stop. Stop! Don't do that.\nNEIL CHUNG: (repeating, Observer-like) Don't do that. You're scaring me.\nANNE CHUNG: You're scaring... me.\nNEIL CHUNG: God gave me a way to see the future so I could give people mercy. (convinced. diluted)\nANNE CHUNG: Neil... I'm sorry. What you heard that night... about your brother... you should never have heard that.\nNEIL CHUNG: But I did. And I'm glad. Every time I saw the disapproving look in your eye, it drove me harder to separate myself through accomplishment. That's why God took notice. Because of you.\nANNE CHUNG: Neil. Please stop this.\nNEIL CHUNG: (stares out the window at Olivia and Peter) Jesus knew the Romans were coming for him. He could have avoided his death so easily. But he didn't. He had faith that God had a plan. I understand God's plan for me now. And I'm willing to go. (pulls pistol from his belt)\nOLIVIA: (pounding on the front door) FBI. Open this door, or we're coming in!\nANNE CHUNG: (terrified) FBI?\nOLIVIA: FBI. Put your hands up. (knocks door open)\nNEIL CHUNG: Don't you remember, Mom, what the priest said about Alex at the funeral?\nOLIVIA: (points gun) Stand up slowly and put your hands behind your head.\nNEIL CHUNG: He said angels don't belong on Earth.\nOLIVIA: Keep your hands where I can see them, and turn around very slowly.\nNEIL CHUNG: I'll see you in heaven. (shoots at the window, is shot in the chest)\nANNE CHUNG: Agh! No! no! (holds her son as he collapses at her feet)\nPETER: (later, as the EMTs carry Neil's body away) Hey, how you holding up?\nOLIVIA: (reflective) You know, he wasn't trying to hit me. He fired at the window on purpose.\nPETER: How do you know that?\nOLIVIA: I think he knew we were coming, and he wanted us to shoot him.\nPETER: I guess it makes sense. I mean, he could see the past, present, and future. But he had a gun. Why not just shoot himself?\nOLIVIA: Because he was religious. If he committed suicide, he wouldn't be allowed into heaven.\nPETER: What about all the people he killed?\nOLIVIA: He thought he was saving them. This was his way to become an angel.\nPETER: Hmm.\nOLIVIA: (as he steps out) Peter. I know it's taken me some getting used to, but as long as you're stuck here, you make a good partner. (begins walking away)\nPETER: (flattered) Thank you.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (blurts) Doctor Bishop. We are leaving. (receives hug in return)\nFAUXLIVIA: Hey, Walter. Here, I want to show you something. My ingenious piece of spy tech. (holds up the silver box, unlocks it with a few flips and turns. offers a tasty treat)\nWALTER: Mints? (takes one and eats it)\nFAUXLIVIA: Similar. They're Bobbins. They're delicious.\nWALTER: It's almost like Wintergreen. Only smokier. One for the road. (grabs licorice jar and offers a whip)\nFAUXLIVIA: (smiles) Are you giving me a send-off?\nWALTER: (flirtatious) You may possess positive qualities that I previously overlooked.\nFAUXLIVIA: (laughs) Are you flirting with me?\nWALTER: (slyly) In your dreams.\nASTRID: (to her counterpart) It was really nice meeting you. It was amazing, actually.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes.\nASTRID: (offers the gift of perspective) What you said before... my father... we're not very close either. He's a very complex man. He doesn't really show emotion. He does the best with the tools he has. That's just how he is. I know he loves me. At least, that's what I tell myself, even though it doesn't really seem that way. You shouldn't regret that you could've been more for him. It wasn't you.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: (to Astrid) Thank you, Agent Farnsworth.\nASTRID: You're welcome, Agent Farnsworth. (Agent Farnsworth walks away)\n(Astrid unlocks the front door, then walks toward the kitchen)\nSTEPHEN FARNSWORTH: Hey. Well, look who's here.\nASTRID: Hi, Dad. (smiles. down trodden)\nSTEPHEN FARNSWORTH: (understanding) Ah. That kind of day, huh?\nASTRID: Yeah. That kind of a day.\nSTEPHEN FARNSWORTH: Wanna tell me about it?\nASTRID: Yes. But you know that I can't.\nSTEPHEN FARNSWORTH: Yeah. I know. But at least I can feed ya. And I can give my baby girl a big ol' hug. (which he does) Awww.\nASTRID: I love you, Dad. (enjoys the paternal embrace)\nSTEPHEN FARNSWORTH: I love you too, Astrid.\n(while Anne Chung sleeps, two Observers slip past her and open Neil's safe. one removes the time-viewing device)\nMARCH: Here it is. (hands it to December)\nDECEMBER: (examines it) You're right. It's September's.\nMARCH: He must have lost it in 1985, the night he didn't save the boy. He'll be interested to know what happened to it. There's something else. It appears that September did not obey your instructions. The boy is back. Peter Bishop has returned."

Do you love me?\nPETER: I do.\nOLIVIA: Then tell me. I want to hear you say it.\nPETER: I love you. (kisses her. Olivia awakens quickly when her phone vibrates on the nightstand)\nPETER: (calling from the lab. energized) Hey. It's Peter. I'm sorry. I know it's early. Did I wake you?\nOLIVIA: Uh, no, that's okay. What's up?\nPETER: Me and Walter for the last twenty-four hours. We've been working on the machine.\nOLIVIA: Did you make any progress?\nPETER: Yes. I think we had a breakthrough. Could be the first step towards getting me back home, but...\nOLIVIA: ...but?\nPETER: There's something I need your help with.\nWALTER: (pour and carefully mixing at a lab station crowded with beakers, beacons and Bunsens) Gently, gently... the trick is to ensure optimal heat distribution... while not allowing the mixture to separate. (as she approaches the table) Ah, Olivia, you're just in time.\nOLIVIA: What is that smell?\nPETER: Walter is creating a new breakfast cocktail -- hot cinnamon roll.\nWALTER: Did you know that the cocktail was historically conceived as a morning beverage? (eager) The etymology of the word itself, \"cocktail,\" comes from the magnificent rooster, who announces the dawn of each day. (raises a toast)\nOLIVIA: What's in it?\nPETER: Oh, boy. (stifling his abused palate) It's mostly Cinnamon Schnapps and butter, but... right now it's mostly butter.\nWALTER: It needs more butter. (professional assessment)\nPETER: (senses her demure body language) You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired -- that's all. Uh, what did you need my help with? (follows him to another work station supporting a large electro-mechanical component)\nWALTER: Peter and I have completed the biomechanical interface for the machine. The device is uniquely calibrated to work only with Peter's genetic profile. It uses an organic interface (his hand) to transcode Peter's neural impulses into command directives.\nPETER: Just watch. (places his hand on the interface and the device responds)\nOLIVIA: So you're able to control the machine with your thoughts through this?\nPETER: That's how I was able to do it back in my timeline.\nOLIVIA: And what, you just click your heels and think of home?\nPETER: Well, we haven't quite worked out how that works yet, but that's kind of how I ended up here in Oz in the first place, so in theory, yeah.\nWALTER: We won't know for sure until we're able to test the prototype on the machine itself.\nOLIVIA: Which would require Broyles' authorization. (gets it) Now I know why I'm here.\nPETER: You don't mind asking him, do you?\nOLIVIA: No, of course not. I'll see what I can do. (leaves the lab)\nTRUCK DRIVER: I... I have crazy dreams come on. (singing as he drives. the electronics in his rig seem to fail and he is stranded along with other motorists)\nFAINT CHATTER: (stranded motorists mill about, suffering similar misfortune) Yeah, I can't explain it. Another one here. Just stopped working. Oh, yeah. Just the lights went out, and then... just stopped. (small metal objects hover in the tractor cab)\nSTRANDED MOTORIST: Hey, check it out! Do you see that?\nCONCERNED DRIVER: What is that? Over there.\nFAINT CHATTER: We got another...\nTRUCK DRIVER: What the hell?\nDISBELIEVING CROWD: (the lights of a commercial jetliner light the area as it passes overhead. dangerously low) Whoa. Oh. Got to be kidding me. Oh... (the jet crashes seconds later. the fireball climbs into the night sky) Honey, come here. Come here. Come here. Yeah. (after the plane crash all of the vehicles return to nominal operating condition) Can't believe it. You got service? Does anyone have cell reception? Is your phone working? Plane just went down. It might now. We should call...\nASTRID: (getting out of the vehicle) I'll get Walter online. (makes cell phone call)\nBROYLES: Welcome to Vermont.\nOLIVIA: Thanks. So what brings us here?\nBROYLES: Atlantic 5-9-1 was passing overhead when a disturbance occurred mid-flight. It appears their electrical and hydraulic systems failed.\nASTRID: (on phone) Walter? (to Olivia) I'm sorry. I can't seem to reach him.\nOLIVIA: Any survivors?\nBROYLES: None. NTSB is currently working the crash site about two miles south of here.\nASTRID: (on phone) Walter...\nBROYLES: But we think whatever caused the crash originated in this location.\nOLIVIA: On what basis?\nBROYLES: Approximately three hours ago, every vehicle on this stretch of highway inexplicably lost power.\nOLIVIA: Well, it could be some sort of interference. Are there any high-frequency radio towers around?\nBROYLES: None. That wouldn't explain some of the stranger events described by witnesses. Objects suspended in midair...\nASTRID: (on phone) Walter, are you getting this? Can you hear me? Walter...\nWALTER: (walking-up behind her) For God's sake, woman, lower your decibels.\nASTRID: You're here, in person.\nWALTER: I thought it was a nice day for a drive. Well, let's get started, shall we?\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) Well done convincing him to leave the lab.\nPETER: Don't look at me. This was his idea.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) I guess he finally got tired of being caged up.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, it's not just that. I mean, he's been much more open lately, somehow.\nWALTER: Peter! Look at this. (grabs hubcap from vehicle)\nASTRID: Walter, what are you doing? This car belongs to someone.\nWALTER: Just watch. (throws hubcap at another vehicle so it sticks to the side)\nPETER: Huh. It's magnetized.\nWALTER: As I suspected -- I didn't think that those levitating effects that the witnesses described were the result of a change in gravity. On the contrary, it seems that for a brief moment, the electromagnetic force in this area was increased dramatically.\nPETER: Which is why all of the cars' electrical systems failed... and probably the plane's as well.\nWALTER: And it was strong enough... (struggles to remove the magnetized hubcap) to leave a residual magnetic force in all metal objects in the vicinity.\nBROYLES: Do you have any idea what caused it?\nWALTER: No. Not yet. I'll -- I'll need to take some samples before I can develop a proper theory. Um, but I - I - I will require some of the plane's wreckage and the black box.\nBROYLES: Go ahead and collect whatever evidence you need here. Agent Farnsworth and I will coordinate with NTSB to take custody of the wreckage and the bodies.\nWALTER: Peter... (and to Olivia) while they're collecting the samples, just down the road, I saw a sign for a place that serves delicious homemade rhubarb pie. Who's hungry?\n(close to midnight, Olivia drives past the city limit \"Welcome\" sign and into the dark, inactive rural township. as advertised, the pie shop is open for business and appears to be the only action in town)\nWALTER: There. \"The Best In Westfield.\" do you see?\nOLIVIA: Damn it. (fiddling with her cell phone)\nPETER: What's up?\nOLIVIA: I can't get a signal. (points down the street) I'm gonna hit that pay phone on the corner, see if I can get an ETA from Astrid. We may have to get the rhubarb to go.\nPETER: Alright. We'll meet you in there.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nBIG WILLY: (as the door to his eatery opens) Come on in out of the cold, Gentlemen. Have a seat. What can I get for you?\nWALTER: Your largest slice of rhubarb pie and coffee, please.\nBIG WILLY: Alright. And for you?\nPETER: Just the bathroom.\nBIG WILLY: (points down the hall) Uh, it's in the back there -- first door on your right.\nPETER: Thanks.\nBIG WILLY: So where you folks from? (pours a cup of coffee)\nWALTER: Boston.\nBIG WILLY: Ah, it's a lovely city. Got an uncle out in Somerville. Your first time in Vermont?\nWALTER: Are we in Vermont? I had no idea.\nBIG WILLY: (robust) What, you folks lost?\nWALTER: (timid) Not that I'm aware of.\nBIG WILLY: Well, how does a man drive all the way from Boston to Vermont and not even know that he's there?\nWALTER: Oh, I'm not allowed to drive. I haven't renewed my license since I got out of the mental institution.\nBIG WILLY: (waits for the punch line. then laughs) You know what? I like you. Pie's on the house.\nWALTER: Oh. (delighted at the gesture) Thank you.\n(Olivia finds her way to the pay phone. An car in the street sits open and unattended. the phone is inoperative. Peter finishes his business and washes up and leaves the lavatory. on his way to rejoin Walter he pauses at the groaning noise from the pantry)\nBIG WILLY: (returns to Walter) Hey. Looks like June got you some coffee. How's your evening going?\nWALTER: Excellent. And yours?\nBIG WILLY: Just fine. So what can I get for you?\nWALTER: Pardon? (confused with his host's confusion)\nBIG WILLY: What do you want to order?\nWALTER: But... but I ordered a moment ago.\nBIG WILLY: This is my busiest shift. Do you want to order or not?\nWALTER: (demurely) But I did. I - I ordered rhubarb pie. And you even offered to give it to me free of charge.\nBIG WILLY: (instant pie rage fills his eyes) Are you trying to steal food?\nWALTER: No, of course not.\nBIG WILLY: (growing irate) Nobody steals from me. Not you, not Cliff, nobody. You hear me, old man?\nWALTER: I hear you. I hear you perfectly well.\nBIG WILLY: (instantly upbeat) Oh. Still got to get you that pie. Must've forgot. I'm sorry about that.\nCLIFF HAYES: (when Peter finds him bleeding on the floor of the pantry) Please...\nBIG WILLY: And there you go. (delivers one large slice of rhubarb pie. front and center) Anything else I can get for you?\nWALTER: No. (genuinely disoriented by the mood swings of his host)Thank you very much.\nBIG WILLY: You're very welcome. (turns, grabs a large chef's knife, then comes over the counter trying to slice Walter in half) Yaah!\nWALTER: Whaa! (blocks the stabbing hand of his assailant) Peter! Peter!\nPETER: (charging from the opposite side of the diner) Walter!\nBIG WILLY: (kicks Peter off of him) Rraah! (Olivia steps through the door and drops Willy with a single round)\nWALTER: Peter...\nPETER: I'm okay.\nOLIVIA: What -- what happened?\nPETER: I don't know, but there's a guy in the back room. I think the cook attacked him. He's pretty beat up. (as Walter helps him to his feet) Thank you. (as Walter checks Willy's dual iris eye) Come on.\nWALTER: (checking the injured man in the pantry) Pulse pressure's weak... probably as a result of the puncture in the arm. An inch to the right, it would've hit his brachial artery.\nOLIVIA: (returning from a search of the restaurant) I just found another body behind the counter.\nPETER: What are you thinking, serial killer?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I mean, I think there's something off about this entire town.\nPETER: Meaning what?\nOLIVIA: The whole place is deserted. I can't get a cell signal. All the phone lines are down.\nWALTER: Do I take that to mean that we can't call for an ambulance?\nPETER: What, you can't treat him here?\nWALTER: Well, he's lost too much blood. Unless he is administered fluid, resuscitation, and a blood transfusion immediately, he may not make it.\nOLIVIA: Well, the nearest hospital is twenty miles away.\nPETER: (finishes dressing the bloody arm wound) Then let's get movin'. Grab his feet.\n(as Olivia drives past the Westfield city exit sign)\nCLIFF HAYES: (weak. groggy) Where am I?\nWALTER: You've sustained some injuries. We're going to get you to a hospital.\nCLIFF HAYES: No. No, we can't leave. We -- we can't leave.\nWALTER: (encouraging) You're going to be alright. Stay with us. What's your name?\nCLIFF HAYES: Cliff. Cliff Hayes.\nOLIVIA: Did you see that? (as she passes the city limit sign into town)\nPETER: Yeah, \"Welcome to Westfield.\" Y - you must've gotten turned around someplace.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I guess so.\nPETER: You just got to stay on the main road. It takes you right back to the highway.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I - I thought I did. (as she passes the city exit sign again) What the hell is going on here? (as she drives back into town seconds later)\nPETER: (looking out the window back at the sign) That's not possible.\nCLIFF HAYES: We can't leave. (weak) We can't leave. We can't leave.\nWALTER: I think our friend's right. We're trapped here.\nOLIVIA: (entering the powerless facility with flashlights) Hello? FBI. Anyone here?\nWALTER: Put him down here, Peter. His pulse is dropping. Start the blood transfusion immediately.\nPETER: With what, Walter? (searching the immediate area with his flashlight)\nWALTER: Uh, see if you can find a first-aid kit. There might be an I.V. I'm \"O\" Negative, so I can donate.\nOLIVIA: (checking behind the duty desk) Okay, the phones are out here too. Walter, why can't we leave? Do you think it's got something to do with what happened on the highway?\nWALTER: I'm not sure. I've seen this once before.\nOLIVIA: Where?\nWALTER: Brigadoon. The musical. Magical town in the forest where no one can leave. Of course, that quaint Scottish village was more hospitable than our present locale.\nOLIVIA: Come on, Walter.\nWALTER: I haven't formed a hypothesis at the moment. My concern is keeping this man alive.\nPETER: Found an I.V. Kit. (returns from a back room)\nWALTER: Good. Put pressure here. (right arm) Prepare two needles.\nCLIFF HAYES: We're not safe here. (frightened) This town... everyone's crazy. (feeling better as Walter transfuses blood into him) It started three nights ago. My sister woke us up. She was frantic. She was so scared. A man had broken into her house. I tried calling the Sheriff, but the phones were down, so I went over. When I got there, I found... her husband in the bedroom... shot in the head... point-blank.\nOLIVIA: The intruder killed him?\nCLIFF HAYES: Not the intruder. Her. She said she'd never seen him before in her life. (disbelief) They'd been married for eighteen years.\nPETER: So the effects are amnesic?\nCLIFF HAYES: Not exactly. She was delusional, she was talking about people she'd never met... things she'd never done... children she didn't have. It was as if she was... having memories, all of a sudden, from someone else's life.\nWALTER: The symptoms you are describing -- it resembles schizophrenia. I know it well.\nCLIFF HAYES: Except it wasn't just her. It was everyone.\nOLIVIA: So how can an entire town turn schizophrenic overnight?\nPETER: Some sort of biological contagion? Maybe a virus that affects the human brain?\nWALTER: A virus doesn't explain why we drive out one side of town and right in the other. Oh, this is something else. What else can you tell us about the symptoms?\nCLIFF HAYES: Most got sick right away. Others took longer, like, hours, a day. But it always started the same way. First, confusion, forgetting things... tremors. Some of them became paranoid. Others turned violent.\nPETER: Like our friend at the diner.\nCLIFF HAYES: A few of us who are immune are holed-up at the High School. Including my wife and daughter. That's why I went to the diner, to get them food. They need supplies. But what they need most of all is hope. Knowing that the FBI is here might give them that.\nOLIVIA: Alright, we need to find a way to contact Broyles and let him know what's going on here.\nPETER: I did find some radios out back. I could try to send out a signal, but I'm gonna need an elevated place with a clear line of sight and something to boost the power.\nCLIFF HAYES: There is a -- an emergency generator at the High School.\nPETER: What do you think?\nOLIVIA: I think we're gonna need a few things first. (as they comb the weapons locker) You know, I think there's a military base about fifty miles from here.\nPETER: You think the Army's involved in this?\nOLIVIA: I mean, something of this magnitude -- a whole town? Perhaps it was a military experiment gone wrong, like that case we caught in Edina.\nWALTER: Where's Edina?\nOLIVIA: Uh, Upstate New York. Remember, the whole town's population was disfigured from the military experiment?\nWALTER: We never had such a case.\nPETER: I investigated a case in Edina with my Walter, and my Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Oh, right. Right, well, I must've -- I must've read it in your debrief. (dismissing her own oversight)\nWALTER: Oh, uh, Peter, now, now, I don't consider myself to be a violent man... per se, but given the danger of our, uh, present predicament, I think it would be best if I had one of those. (handed a canister after Peter shoulders his shotgun)Pepper spray?\nPETER: Just remember it shoots that way. (turns the can around)\nWALTER: Oh.\nOLIVIA: (to Cliff) You ever use a gun?\nCLIFF HAYES: I'm a teacher.\nOLIVIA: Okay, red button, safety. (hands-over the pistol and heads for the door) Come on. (to all) Okay, let's go.\n(as the foursome steps out into the morning light. odd noises emanate from a nearby alley)\nCLIFF HAYES: What's that? W..\nPETER: ...shh, shh. You guys hear that? (to disinterested man walks up the street with a bloody doll in his hand. Peter charges his shotgun and takes-up point to protect the others. as the man trundles past)) We got to get out of this town.\nOLIVIA: (as the car fails to start) Come on.\nWALTER: It won't start. The increase in electromagnetism that caused the cars to lose power on the highway must be present in this town too.\nOLIVIA: Well, it was working when we pulled in.\nWALTER: Well, the effect must be intermittent. We can wait, but we have no idea how long it will last. (Olivia abandons the vehicle)\nCLIFF HAYES: (to Walter. privately, as they make their way to the school) I see the resemblance.\nWALTER: Pardon?\nCLIFF HAYES: Agent Dunham said his name is Bishop, like yours. He's your son, isn't he?\nWALTER: (fighting against the wind) In a fashion, yes, you could say that.\nPETER: You alright? (as she lags behind)\nOLIVIA: Yeah. It's just -- my arm won't stop shaking. That's all.\nPETER: Whoa, whoa. What's the matter?\nOLIVIA: No, I'm okay. It's just -- I'm just a little bit dizzy.\nPETER: You need some water?\nOLIVIA: No becau...(slurred) Oh, Peter, I don't know how to explain it, but that feels like there was somebody else in my, uh -- in my head. Here... take this. (relinquishes her weapon) I \u2013 I - I'm scared that -- that what's happening to the other people in this town is happening to me.\nCLIFF HAYES: (banging on main access doors to the school) Open up. It's Cliff.\nBRIAN: (opens the door) Cliff. Who are they?\nCLIFF HAYES: They're FBI, Brian. I'll explain inside.\nBRIAN: (after securing the doors) I thought you were dead. What happened?\nCLIFF HAYES: Long story.\nOLIVIA: How many people do you have here?\nCLIFF HAYES: Twelve of us made it.\nBRIAN: Eleven. Teresa.\nCLIFF HAYES: When?\nBRIAN: This morning. Locked her up in one of the empty classrooms. Couldn't take the chance she'd hurt one of us.\nLACEY HAYES: (rushes to her father) Daddy!\nCLIFF HAYES: Lacey-girl.\nANGELA HAYES: Oh, my gawd. I thought you were... (embraces her spouse)\nCLIFF HAYES: (comforting) ...No, no. I'm here. I'm here.\nPETER: (privately to Olivia) We've got to tell Walter. If you think what's happening to these people is happening to you...\nBRIAN: So, FBI, huh? Where's the rest of you?\nOLIVIA: Uh, they'll be here soon.\nBRIAN: We've been trapped here for days. Our whole damn town's destroyed. Our friends, our families -- everyone's going crazy, and the U.S. Government sends three people?\nOLIVIA: (professional bearing) Okay, I understand that you have questions, but all I can tell you at the moment is that help will come. Now, in the meantime, we need to work together, find out what's going on here, and also how to get out.\nWALTER: (interjects) If I could examine one of the victims, we might get answers to what's happening in this town. I heard that one of your party went insane. May I see her?\nWALTER: (snaps his fingers to get her attention after examining her eyes) Teresa.\nTERESA: (verbal tangent) You're the man from the government. You're here about our air quality. The air quality's bad here, isn't it?\nWALTER: Hmm. May I? Hmm. Fascinating.\nOLIVIA: What is it, Walter?\nWALTER: (to Olivia) I'll need to take a blood sample. The cook at the diner had two irises in each eye. Perhaps whatever is afflicting these people is creating some sort of rapid mitosis, causing the cells to replicate exponentially, duplicating body parts.\nOLIVIA: Mm.\nWALTER: (upbeat. clinical) I'm going to ask you some questions, Teresa.\nTERESA: (still on a tangent) I should start supper. Lee's going to be home soon.\nANGELA HAYES: (explaining) H - her husband -- he passed six, seven years ago.\nWALTER: So when was the last time you saw Lee, Teresa?\nTERESA: This morning. I packed his lunch before he went to work.\nWALTER: And what did you and Lee talk about this morning?\nTERESA: (new tangent) Is this a joke? Some sick joke?\nWALTER: Sorry?\nTERESA: My Lee's dead... seven years this April. (original tangent) I should start supper. Lee's gonna be home soon.\nOLIVIA: How did it go? Did you get the radio to work?\nPETER: (returning from his reconnaissance) I couldn't get a signal. Even if I had a generator twice that size, there's just too much electromagnetic interference. I think we're stuck here for a while. What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: That woman, Teresa -- her husband died seven years ago, and yet she thinks she talked to him this morning.\nPETER: Let Walter test your blood too. It's the only way you're gonna know for sure.\nWALTER: (after drawing blood) They're probably just psychosomatic -- these things you're feeling. You were always very empathetic, even as a child. That's why you're such a great investigator -- your ability to empathize with the victims. That's all this is. A - and if it's something worse, then we'll deal with it. Well, I - I need to go and examine this.\nOLIVIA: Well, I'm glad you're here -- not just for me but for him. I've seen the way he's been with you lately. Before you got here, he was kind of shut-down and isolated.\nPETER: He's a lot like my Walter, this one.\nOLIVIA: What's she like?\nPETER: Pardon me?\nOLIVIA: The other Olivia. I'm just curious.\nPETER: I don't know, she's, uh -- she's driven. She's very, very stubborn. She doesn't like to lose. But she sees the best in people, even when they don't see it themselves. When she first found me, I was in Baghdad trying to run a scam on these two Iranian businessmen.\nOLIVIA: I didn't picture you as the scamming type.\nPETER: (flirty. not provocative) That's what made me so good at it. Anyway, it was all supposed to be temporary. She told me I just had to babysit Walter while he was working on a case for the FBI, and then after it was done, I could leave, go back to my own life -- despite, of course, how gorgeous she is.\nOLIVIA: Well, you've got good taste.\nPETER: She gave me something that I hadn't had since -- (nostalgic) really since my mom died. She gave me... a place to call home... a place I'd want to call home. Eventually, we even had our own thing.\nOLIVIA: A thing?\nPETER: Yeah, a thing. A routine, you know? On Friday nights, we'd get together. We'd watch cheesy horror films and order in from Damiano's. You ever been?\nOLIVIA: No, but I've driven past on my way home.\nPETER: It's good. You should check it out.\nOLIVIA: Well, she's lucky to have you. (screaming erupts at the opposite end of the corridor)\nANGELA HAYES: Oh, my God! No!\nOLIVIA: What happened? (rushing to help)\nANGELA HAYES: I don't know. I just found her like this. (laying dead on the floor)\nCLIFF HAYES: She got loose somehow. I don't understand. She was fine when we got here. I mean, if it happened to her, what's to say it's not gonna happen to rest of us, and why hasn't anybody come?\nOLIVIA: (emphatic) We're all gonna be okay. We just need to figure out what's happening here and find out how to get out.\nCLIFF HAYES: (frustrated) They shouldn't even be here.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry?\nCLIFF HAYES: Last Fall I was offered a teaching job in Philadelphia. Angela wanted me to take it. I convinced her to stay. I think deep down I was scared to leave here. This town is all I've ever known. If I had just taken that job, my family would be safe now.\nOLIVIA: Maybe. But you are here, and if it weren't for you, they might not have made it this far.\nWALTER: (over the school loudspeaker) Will Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop please report to the Biology Lab at once? Olivia and Peter to the Biology Lab. Thank you.\nWALTER: Peter? Olivia? I think I've worked out what's happened in this town. When I examined Teresa's blood, I found 92 chromosomes in her DNA. Well, that's twice the genetic material that should appear in any human-being.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, how is that possible?\nWALTER: Belly and I once combined a tiny portion of our universe with the alternate universe in a goldfish bowl in our lab. Besides... what it did to the goldfish, the effect on the physics in the overlapping areas was catastrophic. Gravity, electromagnetic fields --\nPETER: Walter, what you're saying is the two universes merged together somehow?\nWALTER: Yeah, I'm afraid I am. (draws on the chalkboard to explain) Um... These two circles... represent the respective universes. And this overlap is the town. Now, for reasons that I am yet to deduce, our Westfield has merged with the Westfield from the alternate universe, trapping the three of us in the overlap.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, how can two universes merging drive an entire town insane?\nPETER: Maybe the same thing that's happening to the town is happening to the townspeople. They're merging with their doppelgangers.\nWALTER: Which would explain why Teresa, uh, thought her husband was alive and dead at the same time. I mean, can you imagine being flooded with years of experiences and memories that were not your own? The mind -- unable to distinguish between what's real and what is not.\nOLIVIA: (all business) Okay, well, can it be reversed?\nWALTER: Sadly, no. I am afraid the damage is done.\nPETER: So what are you saying, Walter, that Olivia's -- (concerned)\nWALTER: What? (unconcerned) No, Olivia's blood was fine. Did I fail to mention that?\nPETER: Yes, you left that part out.\nWALTER: Oh, you're -- you're perfectly fine, dear. Now, as with all of us, it stands to reason that Cliff and the other people here do not have doppelgangers at present in the town in the alternate universe.\nOLIVIA: But Cliff said that he turned down a job offer in Philadelphia last fall.\nPETER: Right, but in the alternate universe, he must've taken the job and moved his family. Hey, Walter, could any of this happen naturally?\nWALTER: I \u2013 I \u2013 I - I don't see how. When Belly and I merged just a tiny portion of the universes, the energy required was tremendous. I - I can't imagine an energy source that would merge an entire town.\nPETER: What about Amphilicite?\nWALTER: (contemplates) Yes, that would do it.\nOLIVIA: You think that David Robert Jones is involved?\nPETER: I don't know, but maybe that's why he was at the quarry. Mining Amphilicite, to do this.\nOLIVIA: But why? I mean, to what end?\nWALTER: Of course, if my theory's correct, it presents a more pressing problem. The effects I have just described -- t \u2013 they are just Phase One.\nOLIVIA: What's Phase Two? (as the building shakes unexpectedly)\nCLIFF HAYES: (joins the Science Team) Agent Dunham, you need to see this.\n(after rushing to the roof and checking the horizon)\nWALTER: (as major structures in the town fade to the realm of the ethereal) That... is Phase Two.\nCLIFF HAYES: Lacey, come on. (to his daughter as she watches the town consume itself through the window) Come away from there, Honey.\nLACEY HAYES: (as the building shakes again) Daddy, what's happening?\nCLIFF HAYES: It's gonna be okay. Go with Mommy.\nWALTER: (to Olivia) I just don't know what to do. The two towns have merged together. They're creating an excess of mass and energy in the overlapping regions. The fundamental forces of physics are colliding -- out of balance, destroying everything.\nOLIVIA: Well, isn't there anywhere we'll be safe?\nWALTER: No. Two things cannot occupy the same space without dire consequences. Both towns will be destroyed and all of us with them. (fatalistic)) There's nothing we can do. There's nothing we can do.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) M - maybe you should go and talk to him.\nPETER: Me?\nOLIVIA: Well, I've seen how you two are together, and he seems to respond to you.\nPETER: Walter... there must be something we can do. You said that the forces of nature are colliding. Do you think they could be offset by opposite forces?\nWALTER: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. The sum of equal and opposite vectors is -- is zero. (it dawns on him) Very clever, Peter. (optimistic) We need to find the place where the opposite forces meet and cancel out.\nPETER: Like the eye of the storm.\nWALTER: In a hurricane, the center is said to be the safest spot.\nPETER: And after this thing is said and done, it might be the only place that survives.\nWALTER: Of course. We need to find the true center of the merger.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, you do that. I'm gonna get us a ride.\nPETER: (to Walter) Come on.\nOLIVIA: (moves across the room) Okay, we need to get to a place where we're gonna be safe from the destruction.\nCLIFF HAYES: Where?\nOLIVIA: We're working on it. But we're gonna need vehicles to transport us there. Now, we know that the phenomenon affects electronics, so any fuel-injected engines won't work. We need older cars, uh, any running models from the 1970s -- two, maybe three to transport everyone safely.\nBRIAN: (overhears) I might have a better idea.\nPETER: (reviewing a city map) We left town here. And we entered for the first time here.\nWALTER: And Cliff said the first building to fall was the bank here on River and Highway.\nPETER: Right. So, in order to find the bull's-eye... connect the points. Divide in half. Construct the perpendicular bisectors.\nWALTER: (plotting) And extend to their intersection -- in the center here.\nPETER\/WALTER: (in unison) Cypress and Quimby..\nPETER: (hands her the map as the group leaves the school in the high winds) We think the center's gonna be right there.\nOLIVIA: Cypress and Quimby. That looks about four miles from here.\nWALTER: If Peter's theory is correct, it will be the only thing left standing when the town collapses upon itself.\nBRIAN: (pulls in front of the group in a school bus) Need a ride?\nCLIFF HAYES: (to his family) It's okay. It's okay. Daddy won't let anything happen to you. Go ahead.\nLACEY HAYES: Mommy. I'm scared.\nBRIAN: Okay. Where am I going?\nOLIVIA: Okay, uh, Cypress and Quimby. Do you know that?\nBRIAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a bike shop there.\nWALTER: (to the child) Don't cry, dear. We're going to a safe place. We'll be fine. You'll see. (as a citizen with two faces emerges from the back of the bus) Peter!\nPETER: (after Walter sprays his attacker with pepper) Nice shot. (pushes his attacker out of the rear emergency exit)\nOLIVIA: (to the panicked group) Okay, is everyone alright?\nCLIFF HAYES: I think we better get moving.\nOLIVIA: Okay. (as Brian drives-off)\nPETER: (after the bus stops short of it's destination. about the downed power pole blocking the route) Well, that's not moving!\nWALTER: (disembarking the group) Okay, everyone, we're on foot from here! Make sure you stay together. Come on, run!\nPETER: Go, go, go! That's the last of them?\nWALTER: Yes.\nBRIAN: Come on! Hurry up, let's go!\nCLIFF HAYES: Lacey! (as she falls in the calamity)\nLACEY HAYES: Daddy!\nBRIAN: Let's go, let's go! Everybody inside! (enters the bicycle shop)\nPETER: (after the scientist stops to assess the environment) Walter, what are you doing? Come on, get inside.\nWALTER: Peter. Peter, you were right. This is it. This is the eye of the storm.\nPETER: Great.\nWALTER: We'll be fine. We -- we'll be safe here. (the front window explodes and shatters)\nLACEY HAYES: Daddy, I'm scared. So loud. (a din settles over the locale)\n(after the survivors emerge, the responders descend on the epicenter of the colliding universes. less than an acre is still intact)\nBROYLES: (on his cell phone) Understood. Coordinate with C.o.C. and keep me apprised of any changes.\nOLIVIA: Anything?\nBROYLES: Search teams just checked in. They scanned the entire area. No other survivors. And it gets worse.\nOLIVIA: How?\nBROYLES: During the search, we found several unusual devices. We're not sure how the technology works, but they were placed around the perimeter of the town.\nOLIVIA: David Robert Jones.\nBROYLES: HazMat detected trace amounts of Amphilicite.\nOLIVIA: What would David Robert Jones have to gain by destroying a town that people didn't even know was here to begin with?\nBROYLES: I don't know. But the amount of Amphilicite recovered from those devices is only a fraction of Jones' stockpile.\nAGENT: (approaches) Sir, we've got Director Norris.\nBROYLES: (to Olivia) Go home. I can take it from here.\nOLIVIA: (sits for a chat) Hey. How is Lacey holding up?\nCLIFF HAYES: It's just a sprain. She's fine. She's strong. (as EMTs treat his daughter nearby)\nOLIVIA: And how are you?\nCLIFF HAYES: My home... everything I've ever known -- how did they just disappear?\nOLIVIA: I wish I knew.\nCLIFF HAYES: Even if you did, you probably wouldn't be able to tell me, right?\nOLIVIA: The Bureau is gonna help you with temporary housing until you get back on your feet.\nCLIFF HAYES: Well, we have each other. No matter what happens, we'll face it together. (Olivia nods and departs)\nWALTER: (safely home. slaving over a hot Bunsen burner) Beautiful.\nPETER: (headed for the door) See you tomorrow.\nWALTER: You're leaving? But I - I've made crepes -- breakfast for dinner. Second most important meal of the day.\nPETER: (laughs at the homey gesture) I'm sorry, Walter. I didn't know. Will you take a rain check?\nWALTER: Of course.\nPETER: First thing tomorrow morning, I promise. And maybe by that time Broyles will have allowed us access to the machine.\nWALTER: Oh, yes. We can resume our efforts to get you home. Peter... (full of fatherly pride) good night.\nPETER: (heartfelt) Good night, Walter.\nOLIVIA: (answers the knock at her door) Hey, come in.\nPETER: Hey. I hope you don't mind. (enters) I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd stop by to see how you're feeling.\nOLIVIA: No, why would I? I'm gonna pour you a drink.\nPETER: What is that that smells so fantastic?\nOLIVIA: (matter-of-factly) What do you mean? It's Friday. I ordered Damiano's. (turns and kisses him on the lips)\nPETER: (startled by the familiarity) W - whoa. Olivia."

Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I'm fine.\nPETER: Then why did you kiss me?\nOLIVIA: (giddy. confident in her reply) I don't know. It just felt like that's what we'd do. It just felt normal.\nPETER: (concerned over her recent personality swings) How long have we known each other, Olivia?\nOLIVIA: Three months. Peter, I know who you are, and I know who I am. I think that this may just be some residual effects left over from being in Westfield.\nPETER: Then we should let Walter have a look at you.\nOLIVIA: No, I'm -- I'm fine. Honestly. I think what I need is just some rest. I'm sorry that I kissed you. To be honest, I'm a little bit embarrassed about it.\nPETER: There's no need to be embarrassed. (pauses. concerned for her health) Maybe I should stay here for a little while -- you know, just while you rest, in case.\nOLIVIA: I would really like some time to myself. I think I've got another migraine coming on.\nPETER: (as he steps out the front door of her apartment) If you're still feeling this way in the morning, will you please let Walter take a look at you?\nOLIVIA: Okay. (as she closes the door to her home, she has a brief flash of memory from the timeline Peter previously experienced. she arrives at his home) Hi.\nPETER: Come on in. (she convulses slightly as the memory she is visualizing shows a golden glimmer around Peter)\nSEAN KEENAN: (a patient at the mental health facility wanders through the unlit dining hall late in the evening - focused on activities taking place elsewhere) Shh, quiet, quiet. We're almost there. It's time. (visualizing and hearing a major felony hundreds of miles away in Douglaston, New York. three young men enter a home without invitation) He's in the kitchen.\nMICHAEL GREENE: (homeowner fiddling with a bag of popcorn) Oh, hot, hot.\nSEAN KEENAN: (sharing the collective thinking of the trio of home intruders from the hospital) Fan out. You two, fan out. Be careful.\nBERNADETTE: (hospital staffer enters the dining hall) Sean. Hey, what are you doing in here? You should be in bed. Sean, it's me, Bernadette. Okay? Come on. I'm gonna take you back to your room.\nSEAN KEENAN: (still focused as she walks him to his room) He's in the kitchen.\nBERNADETTE: Come on. Let's go.\nSEAN KEENAN: (verbally sharing his image of Michael Greene leaving his kitchen) He's coming your way. He's coming your way.\nBERNADETTE: (struggling to get the tense young man's cooperation) Sean, can you hear me? Sean. Listen, the voices that you're hearing, they're not real. You're okay. Let's go.\nMICHAEL GREENE: (as he is surrounded by the trio in his home. one brandishes a chef's knife) Please. Please, take anything you want. You don't have to do this. No, no, please, please! I beg you. (fleeing upstairs) No, no, no! No! (a plastic bag is placed over his head to suffocate him)\nSEAN KEENAN: (as one of the three receives is injured by broken glass) Damn it, I'm cut! I'm bleeding!\nBERNADETTE: Charles! (calling for back-up help from another staffer)\nSEAN KEENAN: There's three of us and one of him. (still experiencing the murderous attack miles away)\nBERNADETTE: I need some help, Charles! Hold him down, damn it!\nCHARLES: This one's severe.\nSEAN KEENAN: That's better.\nBERNADETTE: I'm going to sedate him.\nSEAN KEENAN: (after he calms from the sedative. to the trio of murderers) It's over. He's dead. It's over.\nAGENT LEE: (finding their way upstairs) What's a killing in New York have to do with a mental institution in Deerfield?\nOLIVIA: The police are calling the murder a home invasion.\nAGENT LEE: And we aren't?\nOLIVIA: We have no idea what the killers wanted, but that's not why we're here. Apparently, a nurse here watched the news report this morning, and last night, a patient with schizophrenia had recounted the entire crime in great detail... as it was happening.\nAGENT LEE: There really aren't any normal days in this job, are there?\nOLIVIA: Nope.\nWALTER: (sitting in a corridor, talking to a glossy-eyed patient of unique stature and character) That's when I told him. I said, \"Tim, \"it's not what the L.S.D. can do. It's what the human mind can do that is truly wonderful.\nASTRID: (finding her ward) Walter, there you are. Olivia and Lincoln just got here. What are you doing?\nWALTER: I'm conversing with my friend here, Mister....\nBERNADETTE: Silbiger. Who, at this hour, believes he's circling Venus.\nWALTER: (delighted) Oh. That's a lovely planet. Hmm. Hmm. (good choice)\nOLIVIA: (walking to Sean's room) So how long has Mister Keenan been a patient here?\nBERNADETTE: Sean. About three years now. Although I\u2019m pretty sure he spent time in at least two other hospitals before we admitted him. He's been institutionalized since he was fourteen.\nWALTER: These voices he hears \u2013 are they demons or God or ? \u2014\nBERNADETTE: Actually, Sean's hallucinations have never been grandiose or violent. Last night was the first time I\u2019ve heard him talk like that. His room is right through here.\n(Olivia stops momentarily as another flash of memory floods her senses. she visualizes herself and Peter walking through the halls of another mental institution, years earlier)\nSEAN KEENAN: (once the Science Team has assembled) I don't understand. Are you saying the voices I hear in my head are real?\nOLIVIA: We don't know what to think right now. Now, this is the man who was killed. (places photo on the table in front of him) Have you ever seen him before?\nSEAN KEENAN: No.\nAGENT LEE: But you know how he died.\nSEAN KEENAN: I didn't -- I didn't hurt that man.\nAGENT LEE: (placating) We know that.\nSEAN KEENAN: Those -- voices, they -- they did it.\nOLIVIA: Sean, can you hear the voices now?\nSEAN KEENAN: No. No, they -- they come and go.\nWALTER: (thoughtful) Do they ever come from objects? Say, a tree or a wall?\nSEAN KEENAN: No.\nWALTER: I see. So they always come from inside your head. How many voices do you hear, Sean?\nSEAN KEENAN: Uh, I don't know. I... I think I recognize eight, maybe nine. But... not always. Some of them I don't hear for weeks.\nWALTER: Last night, how many voices did you hear?\nSEAN KEENAN: Three.\nAGENT LEE: That's what the police suspect. Three killers.\nSEAN KEENAN: But then one of them left when the other two went to the subway station.\nOLIVIA: The subway station?\nSEAN KEENAN: Yeah, I heard them say that one of them was hurt, like he was cut. He needed to get cleaned up before he got on the train.\nAGENT LEE: Cleaned-up where?\nSEAN KEENAN: Uh, he said the bathroom. It was the last thing I remember, and then the sedative started working, and I -- I fell asleep.\nAGENT LEE: I'll contact the Transit Authority, tell them to search the stations near the victim's home. (leaves the room)\nWALTER: Son, do the voices speak directly to you?\nSEAN KEENAN: No, they don't. They don't talk to me at all.\nWALTER: They only speak to each other?\nSEAN KEENAN: Yeah.\nOLIVIA: (to Walter) What are you thinking?\nWALTER: Sean, would you be willing to go off your meds if it would help this investigation?\nBERNADETTE: (at the duty desk, after the interview) Here's what I\u2019ve been able to get so far, and I can probably get the rest of Sean's medical records within the hour.\nASTRID: Okay, thanks. I'll make copies.\nWALTER: (boldly) I believe your diagnosis of the young man is fundamentally flawed.\nBERNADETTE: Excuse me?\nWALTER: Well, the truth is that the boy was diagnosed schizophrenic because he hears voices. But the voices don't persecute him, or relate to him at all. In fact, recent evidence proves that what he's hearing are the real thoughts of other people.\nASTRID: But how is that possible?\nWALTER: I am not exactly sure yet. I think it may be a case of psychological symbiosis, maybe even mental telepathy. The point is, I believe the voices Sean is hearing - exist.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, what?\nWALTER: It is no delusion. No psychotic episode.\nOLIVIA: (to Bernadette) Sean has agreed to go off his medication. We're hoping that the more he is able to hear the voices, the more likely it is that we will be able to catch whoever's responsible for the killing.\nBERNADETTE: Sean is here voluntarily, so if that's what he wants to do, I -- I just need to explain this to his prescribing physician.\nOLIVIA: Well, I\u2019m happy to come with you.\nBERNADETTE: I think that's probably a good idea.\n(Olivia has another flash of memory en route to see the physician. she and Peter prepare to meet Walter at St. Claire's and extract him to help with the Fringe Task Force)\nPETER: You know what? Why don't you go on ahead?\n(a heavily bearded Walter turns to meet Olivia for the first time. her focus returns to the task-at-hand at Deerfield)\nPETER: (welcoming the unexpected visitor at his front door) Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey. Um, this might be a little bit weird, but I was wondering if I could come in and just have a look around.\nPETER: Yeah, of course. (as she enters) How you feeling?\nOLIVIA: (looks at the family room) That's where Walter used to sleep.\nPETER: How did you know that?\n(Olivia has another flash of memory as she stands there)\nPETER: To disaster narrowly averted. (clinking glasses together in a toast)\nOLIVIA: Or at least postponed.\n(memory flash subsides)\nOLIVIA: We had that case, that couple in Apartment 6-B. The woman who lost her husband. After, I came back here. And then we went upstairs. (visualizes a passionate embrace) I remember.\nPETER: That's not possible.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I remember William Bell. I remember crossing over to bring you back. I remember Jacksonville and seeing you shimmer the first time we kissed. I remember... you walking to The Machineand getting inside and being scared that you were going to die.\nPETER: Olivia, I don't know what's going on, but something must be wrong.\nOLIVIA: I remember it. I remember us. (looks longingly into his eyes) I remember everything.\nWALTER: Okay. Tell me your name, please.\nOLIVIA: (sitting patiently in an examining chair surrounded by sensors and monitors) Olivia Dunham.\nWALTER: Good. And your home address?\nOLIVIA: Walter, I know who I am. Is this really necessary?\nWALTER: I am just making sure the machine is calibrated. And it is. Alright. Let's see if we can figure out what's going on inside your head, hopefully give you some peace of mind.\nOLIVIA: (adamant) Walter, I\u2019m not scared. I keep telling you both.\nPETER: Good. That makes one of us.\nOLIVIA: I know that I should be concerned, but I\u2019m not.\nWALTER: I -- I will factor that in to the diagnosis. (forcefully. polite) Now shoosh, please, both of you, and let me do my job. Now, Olivia. The first time you and I met, where was it?\nOLIVIA: Saint Claire's. The mental institution.\nWALTER: And the circumstances of that visit, everything you can remember.\nOLIVIA: My partner had been injured in an explosion, and I came to see if you were able to save his life. And Peter was with me because I needed a family member to sign you out.\nPETER: No, no. That's how it happened in my timeline.\nWALTER: Now, Dear, I want you to think very carefully. Do you remember going to retrieve me from Saint Claire's by yourself, without Peter?\nOLIVIA: Yes. I got lost on the way there. But it's hazy. It's kind of indistinct, like a -- like an old dream.\nWALTER: (to Peter) Brain scan?\nPETER: There's nothing unusual with the brain scan, Walter. But clearly, something is happening. How can she have memories of my Olivia's life that are clearer to her than her own?\nWALTER: My first thought is empathy. Even as a child, you were able to intuit what those around you wanted. Belly and I noticed it during the Cortexiphan Trials. And it's hardly surprising that children from abusive families become highly attuned to the emotional state of the adults around them. Which in this case is you, Peter.\nPETER: Me?\nWALTER: Well, I suspect that Olivia may be empathizing with your strong desire to be reunited with your Olivia. And she meets that need by, in effect, becoming your Olivia.\nPETER: Walter, no matter how badly I want my Olivia back, I can't make this one have memories of things she didn't experience.\nWALTER: That part still confuses me too. Perhaps some form of thought transference. She's channeling your memories. Or...\nPETER: ...or what?\nWALTER: Don't know. (mind wanders) I lost the thought. Too many drugs of my own. It happens. (new thought) Oh! May I take a few strands of your hair to test?\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nWALTER: Would you hold that for me, please? (take sample) Uh, Peter, would you -- (hands over sample)\nPETER: Prepare the slide, yeah.\nAGENT LEE: (enters the lab) How is she?\nPETER: We don't know yet.\nOLIVIA: I feel fine.\nAGENT LEE: That is two pieces of good news. Transit authorities found a wad of bloody paper towels at the Roosevelt Street Station bathroom, just like Sean described. Now, the DNA analysis suggests that we're looking for a Caucasian male, but so far, no hits from the database.\nWALTER: May I see the file?\nPETER: Hey, Lincoln. Can you give me a hand?\nWALTER: Just a minute. This DNA report -- I\u2019ve seen one like this before.\nAGENT LEE: Where?\nWALTER: Our misdiagnosed schizophrenic, Sean. (points at macro-photo comparison) This strand of DNA is from Sean, and this from our suspect at the crime scene. Now, see that? They have the same chromosomal spur.\nAGENT LEE: Which means what?\nWALTER: The effect of the abnormality? I have no idea. It may mean nothing physically, but the point is that a spur like this is incredibly rare, and they both have the exact same one. Which, along with their genetic profiles, can only mean one thing: Sean and our killer are brothers.\nOLIVIA: Brothers.\nWALTER: Well, specifically, half-brothers. They only share one parent. But that gives credence to my theory that Sean is communicating with the killers via mental telepathy. There -- there... there are many documented cases of siblings communicating non-verbally, typically identical twins, but not always.\nAGENT LEE: That might explain how Sean is able to hear the thoughts of one of the killers. But he said that he's able to hear the thoughts of all three.\nOLIVIA: What if they're related?\nWALTER: Y - yes. That would explain -- good.\nAGENT LEE: Except that it doesn't. According to his medical records, Sean is an only child.\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m gonna get my coat.\nAGENT LEE: Where are you going?\nOLIVIA: To talk to Sean's mother.\nAGENT LEE: (to Walter) Should she be leaving the lab?\nOLIVIA: You said there's nothing wrong with me physically. So if something shows up in the tests, let me know. Otherwise, we've got a case.\nWALTER: (after the agents leave) I know what you're doing. I know what it's like to want something back that you loved. I have succumbed to that temptation myself.\nPETER: Walter, whatever's happening to Olivia, I\u2019m not doing it.\nWALTER: (judgmental) I think you are. Even without meaning to. And it's wrong, Peter.\nMRS. KEENAN: (sitting calmly in her living room) For seven years, he's been treated for schizophrenia. If that's not it, what is it?\nOLIVIA: That's what we're trying to figure out.\nAGENT LEE: We've already located a significant piece of evidence based on what Sean told us he heard.\nMRS. KEENAN: Sean always told me the voices were real.\nOLIVIA: Mrs. Keenan, does Sean have any siblings?\nMRS. KEENAN: No, we only had one child.\nAGENT LEE: Is it even in the realm of possibility that Sean's father... could have had another child?\nMRS. KEENAN: His biological father? Yes. Sean was conceived through in-vitro fertilization. We used a donor.\nOLIVIA: What can you tell us about the donor?\nMRS. KEENAN: He seemed impressive on paper.\nOLIVIA: Um, what was the doctor's name?\nMRS. KEENAN: Doctor Owen Frank. A friend recommended him when the first I.V.F. we did failed. She said he only took the best donors so that his results were better. It's strange. A reporter called and left a message a couple of days ago. He was doing some sort of a piece on I.V.F.\nOLIVIA: What was his name?\nMRS. KEENAN: Daniel, I think.\nOLIVIA: Daniel Greene?\nMRS. KEENAN: Yes, that's it. I called him back, but he never returned my call.\nOLIVIA: So you never actually spoke to him?\nMRS. KEENAN: No. I did dig up the file that I kept while I was going through the I.V.F. Process. It's in my study. Let me get it for you. (leaves the sitting room)\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nAGENT LEE: So in the -- Department of Strange, what are we thinking? That one of these children killed Greene because of the story he was writing?\nOLIVIA: Maybe.\nAGENT LEE: Alright. I'll contact his editors, see if they know anything about his angle.\nOLIVIA: And anybody else he may have interviewed.\nTV NEWSCAST: Tragic news this afternoon -- the murder of a local hero. Acclaimed author and journalist Daniel Greene was found dead in his Douglaston, New York home earlier this morning.\nSAM: (to Doctor Frank as he absorbs the afternoon newscast) Hey, that's the guy who was here. The reporter.\nTV NEWSCAST: ...attacked and killed, possibly by...\nSAM: I heard about this morning. Three men broke into his house and suffocated him with a plastic bag. You were a doctor. How long does it take someone to suffocate?\nOWEN FRANK: (growing agitated) I want to go back to my room.\nSEAN KEENAN: (sitting with Astrid in the dining hall and inhaling his food. manners are a side thought) I\u2019m sorry.\nASTRID: Oh, it's okay.\nSEAN KEENAN: I don't know what's happening. It's like I haven't eaten in years.\nASTRID: Yeah, it's the detox program that Walter's got you on to wean you off your medication. It's just a side effect.\nSEAN KEENAN: (candid) You're pretty, you know?\nASTRID: Thank you very much.\nSEAN KEENAN: (slight concern) You trust the scientist?\nASTRID: (honestly) Walter? Yeah, I do. You're in good hands. When you start to hear the voices again, that's how you'll know that this is working.\nSEAN KEENAN: Well, in that case, it's -- it's working now.\nASTRID: W - what, you can hear them again?\nSEAN KEENAN: Yes.\nASTRID: Okay. What are they saying?\nSEAN KEENAN: (multiple mumblings) I don't know. I don't know. There are too many of them.\n(Walter is fast at work on the hair sample from Olivia. then his hot tea. then honey for his tea... a stirring thought emerges. Olivia is in her office - on the phone doing her own research)\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I understand that the clinic closed down ten years ago, but that's the most recent address. Okay, well, if you find something more current, could you let us know? Yeah, thank you for your help. (ends call. to Peter) Thank you. Well, it turns out that Doctor Frank was not so good at keeping his A.M.A. information up to date. Do you think that you could go through these old utility bills from the clinic? Maybe there's a contact in there that we can follow up on.\nPETER: Yeah, of course. What?\nOLIVIA: (looks at his hand) Maybe I don't remember everything, 'cause I -- I don't remember you having this scar.\nPETER: You wouldn't. I only got that one a month ago. (as she gently holds his hand and makes eye contact) Olivia--\nWALTER: (from the doorway of the office) I think I've had a breakthrough.\nPETER: (back in the lab. studying a large specimen jar) Bees?\nWALTER: Miraculous creatures. Tens of thousands of them working together to feed, shelter, and protect their colony. And like our suspects... they communicate over long distances. Their glands produce pheromones. Chemical compound that acts as a message. That message is received by their antennae, and then the bees respond.\nOLIVIA: Are you suggesting that the killers are communicating via pheromones?\nWALTER: Not necessarily. Many forms of non-verbal communication exist in nature. Eels use electrical pulses, whales use echolocation, elephants use seismic vibrations...\nPETER: Point, Walter?\nWALTER: (brusquely) Point, Peter... is... how ever these bees are communicating, they are operating as one, doing whatever it takes to ensure the survival of the hive. If Sean and his half-brothers are linked in a telepathic network, then it is possible they have formed a collective identity.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham. (listens) Great. Thank you very much. (ends call) Apparently, Doctor Frank is living at an assisted living facility outside of Roxbury. (to Peter) You coming?\nATTENDING NURSE: There he is, right there.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. (approaches) Uh, Doctor Frank?\nOWEN FRANK: Yes?\nOLIVIA: I'm Agent Olivia Dunham. I was hoping to ask you a few questions about your clinic.\nOWEN FRANK: Of course.\nOLIVIA: Uh, there was a man killed yesterday--\nOWEN FRANK: A journalist. He came to see me last week. Wanted to talk about my research. My work. This isn't the first time that they have killed.\nOLIVIA: They?\nOWEN FRANK: I'm not sure who they are, but I have a suspicion. Three years ago, I hired someone else. Another writer. I wanted to document my work before I was no longer able to. But the day before we were meant to start work, he was also killed. Stabbed to death in his apartment. I thought it was just a -- a random event. But now, I am quite sure it wasn't.\nOLIVIA: What makes you think that?\nOWEN FRANK: The work I was doing at my clinic is merely a means to an end. A vehicle for my real experiments.\nOLIVIA: What were those experiments?\nOWEN FRANK: Genetic manipulation. The babies that I gave life to -- I had altered their DNA. I thought... what I thought really doesn't matter. Suffice it to say I -- I was attempting to make a better...\nOLIVIA: A better what?\nPETER: (knowingly) A better human-being.\nOWEN FRANK: (after returning to his room and his files) Are you familiar with recombinant DNA?\nPETER: It's a DNA sequence created in a lab using the genetic materials of different species.\nOWEN FRANK: Yes. I used that process on my subject embryos that I implanted.\nOLIVIA: Were your patients aware of what they were signing up for?\nOWEN FRANK: I promised them successful pregnancies and healthy babies. And that's what I gave them. I attempted to reintroduce abilities that we humans have long since evolved away from, the hard-wired instincts that we share with other animal species.\nOLIVIA: And would that include telepathy?\nOWEN FRANK: Mm. (nods yes)\nPETER: And a heightened protective instinct?\nOWEN FRANK: I believe that is why they are killing, yes.\nOLIVIA: So, what exactly is it that they're trying to protect?\nOWEN FRANK: Themselves.\nOLIVIA: If your work went public, people would start to ask questions.\nPETER: And they'd start searching for them. And they'd want to study them. We're gonna need a list of your patients.\nOWEN FRANK: The clinic's files are in commercial storage in Back Bay. I - I think I have the address here somewhere.\nOLIVIA: How many are there?\nOWEN FRANK: Subjects? Approximately two hundred.\nOLIVIA: Well, that doesn't conform with what our witness said. He didn't hear that many voices.\nOWEN FRANK: I was constantly modifying the process. With each modification, I created another sample group.\nOLIVIA: And they're all from the same donor. All two hundred.\nOWEN FRANK: Yes.\nOLIVIA: And his information is in the storage facility also?\nPETER: No. It's you, isn't it?\nOWEN FRANK: (removes his glasses) Can you imagine that? The hubris of trying to improve upon god?\nSEAN KEENAN: (pacing quickly back and forth) Okay, uh... we're in trouble, this--this is bad.\nASTRID: Okay, that's good, Sean, just stay with them. (writing quickly)\nSEAN KEENAN: They're -- they're scared. They're -- they're -- they're worried, they feel threatened. There's a new voice. He's one of the three. He's telling the others to wait, he's coming.\nASTRID: Where is he?\nSEAN KEENAN: I don't know, but he's in pain. (as his half brother bandages the wound he received during the murder of Michael Greene)\nWALTER: (after reading the printout with Olivia's test result) Good gawd.\nAGENT LEE: (enters the lab) Hey. I just spoke to Olivia. She's on her way with Peter to retrieve Dr. Frank's research files.\nWALTER: That's not important now. I need you to take me to the bridge.\nAGENT LEE: What?\nWALTER: (angered) I need to see Nina Sharp. I know what's happening to Olivia.\nNINA: (as she is joined in the Massive Dynamic briefing room) Walter. Agent Lee. What a surprise. Uh, hold all my calls, please. So, what is it?\nWALTER: Olivia has Cortexiphan in her system. Someone must have found out how to synthesize it. But how?\nNINA: No.\nWALTER: -- and how\nNINA: Walter, slow down. What are you saying?\nAGENT LEE: Doctor Bishop believes that Olivia has been dosed with Cortexiphan recently.\nWALTER: Recently, and repeatedly.\nNINA: And you know this for a fact?\nWALTER: I did a chemical analysis. The results are irrefutable.\nNINA: Well, how is she? Have you spoken with her?\nWALTER: I examined her. As far as I can tell, she's not in immediate jeopardy.\nAGENT LEE: But we need to find out how this is happening.\nNINA: Yes, of course.\nAGENT LEE: Where do you store the remaining Cortexiphan samples?\nWALTER: The ones that Belly and I kept. It's possible someone may have reverse-engineered the formula.\nNINA: They're at Massive Dynamic, under our tightest security.\nAGENT LEE: In my experience, security can be breached.\nNINA: No, I don't think you understand. That's physically impossible. The vault is biometrically secured. I am the only one with access.\nAGENT LEE: Could you take us to it?\nWALTER: Belly and I numbered the samples before we stored them. If anyone has tampered with them, I will know.\nNINA: Fine. I just need to make a few phone calls.\nAGENT LEE: No calls. The less people who know about this the better.\nNINA: Let's go.\nOLIVIA: (walking through the large storage lot in the cold damp night) Okay, Unit 2251. It's gotta be down here. Look, in case you were wondering, it's hard for me too, you know. I keep expecting to see that look in your eye, and it isn't there. Or it is, and -- and you're pulling back.\nPETER: As I'm sure you can understand, I'm... confused.\nOLIVIA: I'm confused too. I feel incredibly close to you. (upbeat) I feel like I know you better than anyone else in the world, and then when you look at me, it's like none of that is true.\nPETER: Olivia, I don't know what you want from me.\nOLIVIA: I -- I want you to behave naturally. I want you to -- to treat me like you know me better than anyone in the world too. Because you do.\nPETER: I think that's the one we're looking for.\nOLIVIA: Last time I opened one of these, it was rigged with Semtex.\nPETER: You mean with John Scott?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: How'd you know it was Semtex?\nOLIVIA: Uh, because when we were trying to figure out what happened to him, we traced it back to a munitions trader in Hong Kong. Why?\nPETER: 'Cause I didn't know it was Semtex until right now.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: Meaning Walter's theory can't possibly be right. I'm not projecting my memories onto you. You can't have memories that I've never had. (baffled) I don't understand how this is happening. ??\nOLIVIA: I don't understand it either. But whatever this is, whatever the cause, I told you I'm not scared. (positive attitude) I like the feeling. (checks the door) It's unlocked.\nSEAN KEENAN: (sitting with Astrid. more collective visions start to flow) They feel threatened. They need to stop someone.\nASTRID: Okay. Stop who?\nSEAN KEENAN: They're gonna kill her.\nASTRID: Sean. Who?\nOLIVIA: (enters the storage locker and finds the genetic research files and equipment destroyed and missing) Someone got here before us. (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nASTRID: (calling from Deerfield Hospital) Olivia, they know that you're there.\n(vehicle lights appear at the end of driveway as the car speeds toward the storage locker. Peter pushes Olivia clear of the speeding car as it crashes into the storage garage. the attacker tries to club Peter and Olivia but is disarmed and cuffed)\nPOLICE OFFICER: (two uniformed officers approach the duty desk on a mission) Doctor Owen Frank, please.\nDESK ATTENDANT: He's on the Third Floor. Here, let me show you.\nOWEN FRANK: (as two of his genetically altered offspring enter his room) If you're looking for Mister Dubrow, he's moved three doors down. (realizing) You're... you're mine. (as a pillow is grabbed to suffocate him) No.\nDESK ATTENDANT: (approaching Frank's room with the police) He's right in here.\nPOLICE OFFICER: (knocking) Doctor Frank. Boston P.D. Doctor Frank. (enters the room and finds the fresh corpse) Lock down the facility.\n(Sean sits quietly on his bed while the TV blares with a riot scene from a old movie)\nMRS. KEENAN: (turns off the TV with the remote) I told you, Sean, it's too loud.\nSEAN KEENAN: I prefer it on. Will you turn it on? (demanding) Turn it on.\nMRS. KEENAN: Sean \u2013\nASTRID: (enters the room) Sean. What's wrong?\nSEAN KEENAN: (nearly distraught) I can't hear them. When I couldn't hear them before, there was a feeling that they were... with me. Like when s -- you know someone's in the room, even if you can't see 'em.\nASTRID: Okay.\nSEAN KEENAN: This is different. They're gone. There's nothing anymore. Just silence. Why?\nASTRID: (compassionately) I don't know. The truth is we may never know. But I can understand why silence would scare you. You're not used to being by yourself. But this is normal. It was so loud for you that you couldn't even hear yourself think. And I bet you have a lot of great thoughts.\nPETER: (as Olivia parks in front of a fuel pump) So destroying the records and killing the doctor, you think Walter was right? You think they were just protecting the hive? You thinking that this job just can't get any weirder?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. No. (turns to a personal chat) That's not what I was thinking. It's... it's just that now the case is over, we would go back to one of each other's houses. I know that that's what we would do. That was one of the things that we would do. I know that. So now, I don't know if I'm just supposed to ignore that, or what you want, and I guess I just \u2013 I -- Peter, how do you want to play this?\nPETER: Olivia...\nOLIVIA: ...Look, you don't have to answer now. I just want you to think about it.\nPETER: Olivia. I'm thinking about it. T's all I've been thinking about. And I'm afraid. I'm afraid because I've made this mistake before. I betrayed the Olivia that I love. But what I'm really afraid of is... when I look into your eyes, I know it's you. I know it's you. (big kiss)\nOLIVIA: Just gotta, um... I just gotta go pee. (leaves the vehicle for the interior of the store)\nNINA: (places hand on a scanner inside the high tech vault) Biometric hand scanner, like I said. Second-Tier Precaution. (after a nearby locker extends open) There. Twenty vials present and accounted for.\nWALTER: They're all here.\nNINA: Mm-hmm. Now let's focus on the real problem. What's happening to Olivia?\nAGENT LEE: We've already given you all the details we know about so far.\nNINA: Where is she? I'd like to see her. Can I speak with her?\nWALTER: (opens a vial and tastes the contents) This is not Cortexiphan.\nNINA: What are you talking about?\nWALTER: It's potassium iodide with food coloring. Red #4. The Cortexiphan has been replaced.\nPETER: (enters the convenience store and checks the lavatory) 'Scuse me. The, uh, girl who came in here a couple minutes ago, about yea tall, blonde.\nCASHIER: I'm sorry, I -- I didn't see her.\n(Peter steps outside and looks around the premises)\n(groggy and barely conscious, Olivia comes to. strapped to a chair in a dilapidated room, she is face-to-face with a similarly restrained Nina Sharp)\nNINA SHARP: Olivia? Oh, gawd. Olivia? Did they hurt you?\nOLIVIA: Nina?\nNINA SHARP: Shh, it's okay. (disheveled and frightened) We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay."

Nina has to be behind Olivia's disappearance. Once she's been processed in at the FBI, we'll get her talking.\nPETER: (intent on thoroughly searching the premises for a clue) I thought you said she's denying any involvement in this.\nAGENT LEE: For now. Her alibi is not gonna hold. And if she knows where Olivia is --\nPETER: Good luck getting Nina Sharp to break down and tell us.\nAGENT LEE: Alright, point taken. You still haven't told me what you're hoping to find here.\nPETER: If Walter's right and Olivia is being dosed with Cortexiphan, it stands to reason that she was gotten to when she was alone And vulnerable.\nAGENT LEE: You think she was being watched? (Peter nods) And this Cortexiphan is the reason she's been acting strangely.\nPETER: That's Walter's theory.\nAGENT LEE: Right, he thinks that you've been somehow projecting your Olivia onto her, that she's assuming the memories and personality of the Olivia from your timeline.\nPETER: (curt) Is any of this relevant right now?\nAGENT LEE: (snip) It is to me. She's my partner. And if that's true, think about what you're doing to her. Unintentionally or not, you are robbing her of her identity, her life. She is not your Olivia, Peter.\nPETER: And what if she is?\nAGENT LEE: (matter-of-factly) You know that's impossible. Yet you still let her continue working the case, knowing that she was under your influence, that she wasn't herself. I don't know you that well, but I'd like to think you weren't ignoring her safety for personal reasons... and that you're not ignoring me right now.\nPETER: (staring at a ceiling-mounted smoke alarm) I'm not ignoring you. (stands on table and pulls down device)\nAGENT LEE: (studies the small camera hidden in the alarm) Wireless closed circuit. It could have transmitted anywhere. What's that?\nPETER: It's a backup memory disk. I've seen surveillance cameras like that before. They continually capture and store images on a disk like this in a sixty-minute loop.\nAGENT LEE: Olivia hasn't been here all day. I doubt it's recorded anything useful in the last hour. I can have our Techs take a look.\nPETER: They're not gonna find anything, but maybe Walter and I will. Let Broyles know that we're working on this. In the meantime, you should keep on working on Nina, 'cause if this doesn't pan out, you're gonna have to do the impossible.\nAGENT LEE: What's that?\nPETER: (departs the residence) Get her talking.\nNINA SHARP: (sitting restrained, facing one another) Well, they came for me in the middle of the night, when I was asleep. They grabbed me. Before they put the bag over my head, I saw her stepping out of the shadows behind them. It was me, Olive. I mean, she looked exactly like me.\nOLIVIA: So it wasn't you that I saw in your office a few weeks ago? You didn't come to my apartment to help me when I was sick?\nNINA SHARP: No, I\u2019m sorry, sweetheart. I wish I could say that it was. I've been so worried about you. You know, all the time they've held me here, he still hasn't told me what he's after.\nDAVID JONES: (enters the holding cell) Olivia Dunham. I've waited so very long to meet you.\nOLIVIA: Actually, we've already met.\nDAVID JONES: You have me at a bit of a disadvantage.\nOLIVIA: I watched you die. And I'm looking forward to seeing you do that again.\nLELAND SPIVEY: Maybe confusion's an unforeseen side effect.\nDAVID JONES: I'm a bit confused myself. She's not the first to say that to me.\nOLIVIA: A side effect from what? What does he mean?\nDAVID JONES: Well, of course, you don't know, though I imagine you've been feeling the effects for some time -- your migraines, for example.\nOLIVIA: What the hell did you do to me?\nDAVID JONES: Nothing... that wasn't already done to you a long time ago. But then... you were just a child. Doctor Bishop's notes from the Cortexiphan Trial were quite clear. The subjects' abilities were triggered by sparks of intense emotions, hmm? Let's prime that. Every journey begins with a first step. (picks-up a heavy duty electric powered drill)\nNINA SHARP: Jones, you leave her alone.\nDAVID JONES: Always the protective mother hen.\nNINA SHARP: What are you doing? (as her robotic arm is exposed)\nOLIVIA: Don't. (as Jones prepares to torture Nina with the drill)\nNINA SHARP: No. (as the drill bit in her arm sparks and shorts the circuitry)\nOLIVIA: Nina. Damn it, Jones. Stop!\nDAVID JONES: Yes, I believe this will work nicely.\n(on a brisk day in a large downtown, public square, a small parliament of Observers gather to report)\nDECEMBER: Have you located him?\nJULY: No. Do we know why he failed to carry out his instructions, why he did not erase the lingering traces of Peter Bishop from this timeline?\nDECEMBER: That is a question only September can answer, as well as if he is responsible for Peter Bishop's return. September has continually intervened on behalf of this boy, despite all warnings. He has been given every chance.\nMARCH: How should we proceed?\nDECEMBER: We wait. He will surface again. And when he does, he will have to face the consequences. (strolls away from the group)\nNINA: Have they found her yet? (as the Fringe Task Force SAIC enters the room)\nBROYLES: Sit down, Nina.\nNINA: Now, Phillip, tell me. Do you have any idea if she's alright?\nBROYLES: Do you?\nNINA: (in disbelief) How can you ask me that? I raised Olivia as if she was my own daughter.\nBROYLES: (not asking. telling) Sit down.\nNINA: Phillip, you know me. Do you honestly believe that I\u2019ve been dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan, that I could have had anything to do with her disappearance?\nBROYLES: I want to believe you, Nina. If you care about Olivia as you say, then cooperate. The more you tell me, the sooner I can find her, and the better it'll be for you.\nNINA: (frustrated) For God's sake, Phillip, I have already told you everything that I know. I should be coordinating with Massive Dynamic resources to assist in the search, not sitting here in some damn cell.\n(Lee enters the room and places some paperwork in front of Broyles)\nBROYLES: (reads the new file) When were you last in the Massive Dynamic Deep-Containment Facility?\nNINA: Yesterday afternoon with Agent Lee.\nAGENT LEE: And before that?\nNINA: I've told you already. I haven't been there for years.\nBROYLES: The biometric logs show you accessed the storage facility twice within the last three months.\nNINA: Well, that's not true. The logs have been tampered with.\nAGENT LEE: There are eyewitnesses who say they saw you enter the facility. We have signed affidavits from your own security people.\nNINA: (thinking quickly. grasping) A - a shapeshifter. I - it had to have been. That's the only explanation.\nBROYLES: If a shapeshifter was responsible, then you'd be dead.\nAGENT LEE: (damn serious) What are you doing with Olivia?\nNINA: I see where this is headed. You've convicted me already. I'm not saying another word without my attorney present.\nBROYLES: Have it your way. (stands-up and departs with Lee)\nASTRID: (standing behind Peter and looking over his shoulder at his video recovery research) What exactly are you hoping to find on this chip that you haven't viewed already?\nPETER: The camera records over itself every sixty minutes, burying the older images under new footage, so I\u2019m hoping that this machine is gonna give us a chance to reproduce those older images.\nWALTER: (fatalistic) A very slim chance.\nPETER: (sardonic) Thanks for the encouragement, Walter.\nWALTER: I should never have let her out of the lab. You shouldn't have...\nPETER: ...What?\nWALTER: I warned you not to succumb to temptation, Peter. Whatever consciousness Olivia appears to be manifesting now, she is not who you think she is.\nPETER: You don't know that.\nWALTER: What I do know is that if I had kept her here, as I should have, then she wouldn't have been taken. And we wouldn't be fishing in the dark, hinging our hopes on pulling a palimpsest out of that chip.\nPETER: Right now the only thing that matters is finding Olivia. Everything else will work itself out.\nASTRID: Uh, I\u2019m sorry, but what -- what is a \u2018palimpsest\u2019?\nWALTER: A manuscript page from a scroll or book from which the text has been scraped off, which means it can be used again.\nASTRID: Like when you rerecord over an old VHS or cassette.\nWALTER: Precisely. And what was underneath bleeds through --\nPETER: Hold on. I'm getting something. (adjusts joystick controller) I need to...\nWALTER\/PETER: (sync'd) Increase the magnetic contrast.\nPETER: Thank you.\nASTRID: (as image begins to clarify on the monitor) Olivia. Great. Now what?\nPETER: Now we dig deeper, see if we can find out who did this to her.\nLELAND SPIVEY: Let's go. (removing the restraints and escorting the senior prisoner out of the room)\nNINA SHARP: Uh, where are you taking me?\nDAVID JONES: Please, Ms Sharp. Don't make this harder than it has to be.\nOLIVIA: (pleading) Look, David, if it's me you want, you've got me. You win, but you can leave Nina alone, please.\nDAVID JONES: Oh, I couldn't possibly do that. (enters the room) Every horse needs a carrot. Every mouse, a piece of cheese. Incentive, Agent Dunham -- all creatures need an incentive to perform tasks. (places a box on the table) Let's give you a little better view, shall we? (opens the view shield to the next room and turns Olivia's chair so she can see Nina Sharp as she is strapped to a mattress frame)\nOLIVIA: Oh, my gawd.\nDAVID JONES: I'm going to take you through a series of tests. This first one may take some time. (opens a box with a matrix of small lights) I want you \u2013\nOLIVIA: I know what you want me to do. You want me to turn the lights on with my mind. We did something like this before. You were trying to activate my ability to cross between universes. And since you seem perfectly capable of doing that yourself, what is this about?\nDAVID JONES: Whatever you know, Miss Dunham, whatever you think you know of your abilities, I assure you... your potential is... far greater.\nNINA SHARP: (before she is silenced with a gag) Olivia, listen to me! Don't do what he says, please, whatever happens.\nDAVID JONES: Alrighty, then. Let's begin, shall we? Now, if... as you seem to believe, you've done this before, then turning the lights on should not be any problem, should it? (waits. waits some more. calls for some incentive) Perhaps this will help you get started.\nOLIVIA: (as the metal frame Nina is strapped to is repeatedly charged with electricity) Oh, you sonnuvabitch. Leave her alone!\nDAVID JONES: Don't waste all that emotion on me, Miss Dunham. Turn on the light.\nOLIVIA: (focuses on the test at hand) I - I can't. (Nina is zapped again) Please, can you just leave her alone?\nDAVID JONES: Gladly. You know what you have to do. Just one light, and we won't have to hurt her anymore.\nOLIVIA: I can't. Please stop. I ca -- I just can't right now. I'm - I\u2019m tired, and I just need rest.\nDAVID JONES: Very well. (as the observation window into Nina's room is closed) I'll give you your rest. We'll try this again in, uh, an hour. (leaves with the wooden box of lights)\nASTRID: Wait. Stop.\nPETER: What? What do you see?\nASTRID: I don't see anything. But I really have to pee, and I don't want to miss anything.\nWALTER: I've had the same issue for the past ten minutes.\nPETER: Great. Well, you won't have to wait too much longer. We can't dig any deeper because -- hold on a second. If I decrease the chrome and the saturation...\nASTRID: (as the image becomes more viewer-friendly) That looks like a person.\nPETER: Hello. Can Facial-Rec tell us who this guy is?\nASTRID: Send me a capture of the image. I'll forward it to FBI. They can cross-reference with Interpol's database.\nWALTER: (acid) Clearly he works for that harridan Nina.\nPETER: It's who Nina's working for that worries me. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out -- why would Nina be dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan? But then it occurred to me. The only person who's ever done anything like that, at least in my timeline, was David Robert Jones. Maybe he's trying to do the same thing again.\nWALTER: Do what?\nPETER: Activate Olivia.\nWALTER: For what purpose?\nPETER: I don't know. We could never figure it out. But maybe it's for the same reasons now.\nTHE OBSERVER: (appearing suddenly in the center of the lab) Yes. His goal is the same. (collapse from the injury to his chest)\nPETER: (rushes to the injured man's side) You, talk to me. What do you know about David Robert Jones? What do you know about Olivia?\nTHE OBSERVER: (pained) She needs you.\n(as the trio plonk the bald visitor onto a table)\nASTRID: Oh my God, he's been shot.\nWALTER: Check his breathing, dear.\nPETER: There's no exit wound. That bullet's still in him, Walter.\nASTRID: His breathing is shallow.\nWALTER: Pulse is weak. (puts his head to the wounded man's chest) There's no breath sound from his left side. His lung must have collapsed... if he has lungs? Oh, dear God, I have no idea if this man's physiology is similar to ours at all.\nPETER: (returns with surgical tools) It is -- at least that's what you told me in my timeline.\nWALTER: I suppose I have no reason to doubt myself.\nASTRID: Walter, should I call the paramedics?\nWALTER: (to Astrid) They'll just take him to a hospital. He'll have a better chance of surviving with me. We need to cut this bullet out and reinflate the lung. Please get my medical kit, quickly, dear. (points) Peter, put pressure here.\nPETER: Walter, he is an Observer. They only show up at significant events. That he is here must mean it's important.\nASTRID: Well, who could have shot him, and why?\nPETER: Well, I don't know, but he's here. He must have something to tell us. He said, \"she needs you\" - he was talking about Olivia. (phone rings) Ah, damn it.\nASTRID: Here, here, here. (takes over the controlled pressure on the wound)\nPETER: (answers phone) Bishop.\nAGENT LEE: (from the Observation Room next door to Nina's meeting with her lawyer) It's Lincoln. We got the image you pulled. They're running it through facial recognition now.\nPETER: How long do you think before we have an I.D. on that guy?\nAGENT LEE: I'm not sure. We never tried it with an image this weak before. It could take time.\nPETER: What do you think the chances are we're gonna get lucky and Nina starts talking?\nAGENT LEE: I wouldn't count on it. She's got her lawyer in with her now. Short of the Sixth Amendment being repealed, I don't see her cooperating anytime soon.\n(after the two have been freed of their restraints and placed in the same room)\nOLIVIA: I am so sorry that you have to go through this.\nNINA SHARP: Oh, it's not your fault. I mean, none of this is your fault. No, listen to me. I know Jones. I know what he's capable of. William fired him because he was unhinged. You cannot give in.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, but if I don't, then he's going to keep torturing you, and I can't have that. I won't. Okay. Nina? Nina... You -- you have to help activate me.\nNINA SHARP: Olive, I - I...\nOLIVIA: Alright, Cortexiphan is based on emotions. For me, it was always fear-- not fear for myself, but fear for the people that I loved. Now, Jones is -- he's using that, hoping that it will access my abilities. But something's happened.\nNINA SHARP: W \u2013 w - what do you mean?\nOLIVIA: Well, because of the Cortexiphan... I \u2013 I - I can't remember certain aspects of our relationship. I - I can't remember things about us. And without that connection, I \u2013 I - I can't do what he wants. It just \u2013 it -- it won't work.\nNINA SHARP: Now, I -- now, I - I don't understand. Y - you don't remember our life together?\nOLIVIA: No, I \u2013 I - I remember, but... I just... I just need for you to help me feel it. Just -- just help me remember the details, what we -- what we meant to each other. mmm. Maybe if you could -- if you could just tell me a story, maybe the first day that Rachel and I came to live with you.\nNINA SHARP: Uh, oh, well, um... Mm, a social worker brought you and your sister up from Jacksonville on the train. I - I met you at Penn Station. You really don't remember?\nOLIVIA: I remember the train, I think, but... just -- just keep going.\nNINA SHARP: Well, I brought you girls home... to our old house in the Catskills.\nOLIVIA: And I couldn't sleep that night. And so you came into my room. And you sat with me, but I - I can't remember what we talked about.\nNINA SHARP: Okay, I -- you were scared. I mean, after what you'd been through, coming to a new home with a woman that you hardly knew--\nOLIVIA: And I kept calling you \u2018Ms Sharp\u2019.\nNINA SHARP: Yes, you did. That's true. And I told you that you didn't need to worry, that we were a family now... and that whatever happened, we had each other. And we'd be okay. And I - I kissed you on the forehead. I kissed you good night, and you called me \"Nina\"... that was the first time you'd ever done that.\nOLIVIA: I can only remember pieces... Just fragments. It's like looking at a photo album of somebody else's life. This isn't going to work. I don't want them to keep hurting you, but... the only person that this has ever worked with is Peter.\nNINA SHARP: Peter Bishop?\nOLIVIA: The Cortexiphan, my abilities-- it's only ever worked when I've been around him.\nNINA SHARP: Aah!\nOLIVIA: Nina?\nNINA SHARP: Oh! (keels over in agony)\nOLIVIA: Nina, are you okay?\nNINA SHARP: Oh, oh! I \u2013 I \u2013 I \u2013 I \u2013 I don't know. Oh!\nOLIVIA: Hey! We need somebody in here now!\nLELAND SPIVEY: Stand back. What is it?\nOLIVIA: She, uh -- she needs medical attention now. Look, you can tell your boss that if she dies, then his leverage dies.\nLELAND SPIVEY: Bring the gurney.\nNINA SHARP: Olive!\n(rolled out of the room on a gurney. Nina Sharp hops to her feet and grabs a quick drink from the water fountain while her co-conspirator joins her for an update)\nDAVID JONES: Well?\nNINA SHARP: I know why it's not working. She needs Peter Bishop. Apparently, she can't be activated unless he's present.\nDAVID JONES: Somehow I knew he'd be trouble.\nBROYLES: (joins the gathering the operating table) Agent Dunham had asked me not to share this with anyone, but under the circumstances... that man paid a visit to Olivia several weeks ago.\nPETER: What?\nBROYLES: At that Brooklyn opera house, while the two of you were on the other side.\nPETER: What did he want?\nBROYLES: Apparently to warn her. He said he'd seen all possible futures, and in every one, Olivia was going to die.\nWALTER: Peter.\nPETER: Yeah.\nWALTER: You said this man exists out of time. What if, at the opera house, weeks ago, he was referring to events that are happening now?\nPETER: Walter, if he was trying to warn her about this abduction, do you think maybe he knows where she is?\nWALTER: I suppose.\nBROYLES: Doctor Bishop, do you have any reasonable expectation when this man will wake up?\nWALTER: I've treated him as best I can, but he's gone into septic shock. His vital organs are shutting down one by one. I'm afraid there's nothing anyone can do for him now.\nASTRID: (returning from the inner offices) That was H.Q. Found a match on the man in Olivia's apartment. His name is Leland Spivey. His last known address was an apartment in Deerfield.\nBROYLES: I'll deploy a S.W.A.T. unit to his place.\nASTRID: Uh, you're not gonna find him. Leland Spivey died in a car accident three years ago.\nBROYLES: Then how was he in Agent Dunham's apartment weeks ago?\nASTRID: I don't know. Maybe, uh-- maybe if Jones can cross over at will to the other side, he's bringing other people back with him?\nAGENT LEE: You think the guy on the tape is Spivey's doppelganger?\nPETER: It doesn't matter. It's a dead end. The only way to find Olivia is through him.\nBROYLES: You heard Doctor Bishop. He's dying.\nPETER: But he's not dead. He still has brain function.\nWALTER: Peter, you're not suggesting--\nPETER: Why not?\nASTRID: Suggesting what?\nWALTER: He wants to go into the Observer's mind.\nBROYLES: Is that possible?\nPETER: Walter, you know the only way that I'm going to find Olivia is if you can put me into his consciousness.\nWALTER: Peter, this man's brain could operate in ways we can't even imagine. And if he dies when you are in his mind, you could well die too.\nPETER: Can you do it?\nWALTER: Yes.\nPETER: Good. Then let's get started. We don't have much time.\nWALTER: (injects Peter and watches the synaptic activity on two monitors as the Observer and Peter share one brainwave pattern) Okay, Peter, here we go.\n(Peter regains cognitive awareness in a clear glass observation platform just in time to witness a tremendous cosmic explosion in the void of dark space beyond the platform)\nTHE OBSERVER: (commenting on the spectacle) The beginning of all things. I have been privileged to witness it... as I am to witness my end.\nPETER: You know that you're dying?\nTHE OBSERVER: Yes. I was shot.\nPETER: By who?\nTHE OBSERVER: That is not the relevant question.\nPETER: Yes. Olivia. You said she needs my help. Does that mean you know where she is?\nTHE OBSERVER: That, too, is not relevant... Not yet. I am sorry, but I do not have long, and there is much I need you to understand before I go.\nPETER: Who... or what... are you?\nTHE OBSERVER: I am called 'September' but that is a code designation given to members of our scientific team.\nPETER: Scientists? From where?\nTHE OBSERVER: A more apt question would be, 'from when?' we are you-- we're human... many generations after your lifetime. We are one of countless possible futures for humanity. Our technology has uniquely afforded us the ability to travel within and outside of time so that we may observe our beginnings.\nPETER: But you've done a lot more than observe.\nTHE OBSERVER: Yes. It was my attempt to rectify the mistake I made.\nPETER: What mistake? (the spatial viewing platform vanishes and is replaced by the 1985 Bishop lab in the alternate universe) Is that...?\nTHE OBSERVER: Your real father... developing the cure that would have saved your life.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: (the events of 1985 unfold) Excuse me. What are you doing in here?\nTHE OBSERVER: (1985 version) Forgive me, Doctor Bishop. I did not mean to disturb you. I am an admirer. (to Peter in the current timeline) Your father found the cure, but in my desire to witness the moment, I inadvertently distracted him from discovering it.\nPETER: I already know all that. Walter told me, but what were you doing there?\nTHE OBSERVER: (1985 version to Bishop) I'm sorry for disturbing you. (to Peter in the current timeline) It was important. You are important. (having returned to the spatial viewing platform) It was why I could not allow you to drown at the bottom of Reiden Lake, why it was necessary to allow the other Doctor Bishop to cure you instead. Despite my efforts to set things right, these actions only culminated in further corruption of the timeline. The war between the two universes drastically altered destinies and brought about a child that was not meant to be.\nPETER: What child?\nTHE OBSERVER: Your son... Henry.\nPETER: My what?\nTHE OBSERVER: He was born to the wrong Olivia Dunham due to a series of circumstances that never should have happened. This event... would have irrevocably altered everything that was to come.\nPETER: (looks at an image of an infant manifested outside of the viewing platform) Henry. I have a son.\nTHE OBSERVER: Had. When you made the sacrifice to step into that machine, you were not the only one who ceased to exist. So would he. I believed at the time that would be the end of it. I cannot explain, but it is clear that I was wrong. You have managed to return in physical form. I suspect... this will provide an opportunity for you to put things right. She is the one... the Olivia Dunham from whom your shared future was meant to spring. This must be, and everything will be as it was intended. You must find a way... (alarmed) they are coming.\nPETER: Who?\nTHE OBSERVER: You need to go.\nPETER: (as the viewing platform begins to break apart) What's happening?\nTHE OBSERVER: There is no time. I'm going to need you to do something for me.\nPETER: I'm not doing anything until you tell me where to find Olivia --\nTHE OBSERVER: For that, you have only to go home. (strongly suggesting)\nPETER: I know that I have to go home. (fighting to maintain their synaptic link) I know I have to get back to my timeline, but I'm talking about this Olivia in this timeline.\nTHE OBSERVER: Go home. (forces Peter from his mind and back to his colleagues in the lab)\nASTRID: (as the Observer convulses) Walter, what's happening?\nWALTER: I don't know. His heart rate is suddenly spiking.\nBROYLES: Peter, did you make contact? Was he able to tell you where Olivia is?\nPETER: (groggily) No.\nWALTER: Give me 30 milligrams of Propafenone.\nASTRID: (as the Observer disappears from the table he was on and sends nearby equipment flying) Walter!\nAGENT LEE: (genuinely befuddled) Somebody want to tell me what the hell just happened?\nASTRID: (cleaning-up the mess) I don't understand how this table just knocked itself over.\nAGENT LEE: A dying man suddenly vanishes in front of our eyes, and the thing you're wondering is, what happened to the table?\nASTRID: Among other things.\nPETER: He just stopped suddenly, and he said - they're coming - and then I got yanked out.\nWALTER: Well, I didn't do any yanking. It must have been them... the them who were coming.\nBROYLES: You're certain he had nothing else to offer?\nPETER: Mm-mm. He just kept on saying how I needed to get back to my timeline and my Olivia.\nAGENT LEE: Your Olivia and our Olivia? I thought they were one and the same to you.\nBROYLES: Then we're right back where we started... with Nina Sharp being our only real lead. Agent Lee, I think she's been on ice long enough. Let's see if she's ready to deal. (leaves the lab with Lee)\nWALTER: You tried, Peter. It was a valiant effort nonetheless. You're very lucky to have made it out. I can't imagine what would have happened if this Observer had disappeared with your consciousness still inside his brain.\nPETER: He existed outside of time. He could've helped me to find Olivia. (fresh thought) He kept on saying that I needed to get home. What if he was being literal this time -- not home to my timeline, just to my house?\nASTRID: What do you think -- that she's waiting for you at your house after she's been kidnapped?\nWALTER: I suppose it makes as much sense as anything else that's gone on here.\nASTRID: It doesn't make any sense.\nWALTER: My point exactly.\nPETER: I know that sounds crazy, but I got to at least check it out. Maybe there's a clue there that can point me in the direction of Olivia. I'll call you from there if I find anything. (leaves lab)\nPETER: (enters the campus home he has been living in) Olivia? Olivia! You here? (senses he is not alone. turns as Leland Spivey turns on a desk lamp) Where is she? (approaches angrily) I said, 'where is she'? (falls when he is clubbed from behind)\n(Peter is cuffed and dragged to the holding cell where Nina Sharp was tortured)\nOLIVIA: (after hearing the activity) Hello? (after the metal screen is raised in the observation window) Peter? Peter?\nPETER: Olivia. Olivia, are you okay? Did they hurt you?\nOLIVIA: No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.\nDAVID JONES: (enters the room) Nice of you to join us, Mister Bishop. By now, you must have realized that your every word was being monitored. If I overheard you correctly, you believe this man will be helpful in evoking an emotional response, so let's give it a try, shall we? Unless, of course, I was mistaken. I find your silence encouraging.\nPETER: Don't do it, Olivia. (Leland places a knife to Peter's throat)\nDAVID JONES: I'm afraid you must, or Leland here will start slicing off pieces of your friend. (Olivia focuses on the box and turns on the lights all at once) Excellent, Agent Dunham. I knew you had it in you. (the lights in the two rooms begin flickering and growing brighter) Impressive. (the lights grow extremely bright) What are you doing, Olivia?\nOLIVIA: I'm doing what you wanted. I'm turning on the lights.\nNINA SHARP: (tied to the electric torture rack) What? No, Olivia, don't.\nOLIVIA: You're not Nina.\nNINA SHARP: What are you talking about?\nOLIVIA: My high-school graduation -- you told me that now I was an adult. I was no longer allowed to call you 'Ms Sharp'. That was the first time I called you 'Nina'.\nDAVID JONES: (directing Nina's evacuation) Get her out.\n(a powerful electric charge shoots from an overhead light - killing Spivey and knocking Peter to the ground)\nOLIVIA: (enters the room where he was being threatened) Peter?\nPETER: Olivia. (strapped to a chair. on his side on the ground) How did you do that? How did you know how to concentrate your power?\nOLIVIA: Well, I, uh -- I didn't. (as she cuts the zip strips to free him) I just know that... when I was a little girl, I did something similar, and that if they brought you to me, then you might give me what I needed to do it again. Okay. Come on.\n(elsewhere in the abandoned facility. packing quickly)\nDAVID JONES: Best be on our way. (to an accomplice) Be a good fellow and keep them occupied, will you?\n(Olivia goes into spaz-mode and they are confronted in the hallway)\nPETER: Olivia. I got you. You're gonna be okay. I'm here.\nGOOD FELLOW: On your feet, both of you. (pistol pointed at Peter's head)\nPETER: She's having a seizure.\nGOOD FELLOW: I said get up. (attacked by Peter. violent fist and knee fight)\nOLIVIA: Hey! (aims dropped gun. Peter head butts opponent) Oh, God.\nPETER: Come on.\nDAVID JONES: (after activating a trans-universe portal in the corridor of the dilapidated hospital) Please be so kind as to step aside. (to Nina) Ladies first. (Nina steps through to a fully functional Plainfield Memorial hospital in the alternate universe)\nOLIVIA: Jones... don't move. (enters the corridor with her pistol pointed)\nDAVID JONES: (calmly. duly impressed) That was quite a display you put on in there, Miss Dunham. Your love for this man must be something quite profound.\nOLIVIA: Jones, you can step away from the portal.\nDAVID JONES: (turns to step through) Good-bye for now, Agent Dunham. (is shot. then turns and stands with something much less than a critical gunshot wound) It would seem there are some fringe benefits to having one's body reassemble at an atomic level. (waves and steps through the portal)\nOLIVIA: Peter, I -- did you see that? (has another debilitating seizure) I \u2014 Oh.\nPETER: I got you. (catching her as she collapses) I got you. Let's get you out of here, okay?\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: (outside, as they exit onto the poorly lit grounds. on his cell phone) Yeah. Yeah, Plainfield Memorial. But, Lincoln, make sure that you tell the EMTs that she's gonna need Diazepam. Alright, thanks. (to Olivia) Alright, first responders are on their way. You're gonna be fine.\nOLIVIA: It's okay. I'm feeling better now. I guess all the energy that I expended did a number on my nervous system.\nPETER: Maybe... (concerned at his substantial influence) but maybe it was me... just by being close to you, like Walter said.\nOLIVIA: Well, Walter isn't always right.\nPETER: Yeah, neither am I. At the gas station just before you got taken, you were ready to come home with me, and I was ready to think that that was okay. But it wasn't. It was a mistake... one that I promised myself I'd never make again.\nOLIVIA: This isn't the same as what happened \u2013\nPETER: I saw her. I saw my Olivia -- the one that I am supposed to be with, the only one that I'm supposed to be with.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I don't understand what's happening to me any more than you do. But that doesn't change what I do know, what you know -- that if you look at me -- if you -- if you look -- if you look into my eyes, then you can see that I am her.\nPETER: (heartfelt) No. No, you have her memories, or you have my memories of her. You're a projection or -- I don't know what. But when I looked into your eyes, what I saw was what I wanted to see. I know she's out there... my Olivia, in my timeline, waiting for me. And I let myself forget that, so I\u2019m sorry, Olivia. And I'll be sure that Walter can fix you up somehow and give you back your life. But for right now, I think it's better if I just stay away.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Peter, I \u2013 I - I'm in love with you, and I - I can't just -- just turn that off now. I don't want to lose you. W - where are you going?\nPETER: Home. I have to go home. (turns and walks from the hospital grounds as emergency personnel arrive and park)"

We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did. The truth is... I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts. I know when there's something you want to talk about.\nOLIVIA: I'm in love with Peter. I know it sounds absurd to you. I hardly know him. But it's like I've known him my entire life. And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.\nNINA: When Walter told me what you were going through -- two sets of memories, two sets of experiences -- he said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things that Peter wants you to remember.\nOLIVIA: But I can remember things that Peter couldn't have known, like details of cases that he wasn't on or names, um, places he's never been. I mean, how can that be if -- if he's controlling it? I don't know how this is happening, but... I'm scared.\nNINA: We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive. Now, as for your feelings about Peter, all wounds heal over time.\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I just wish the time would move a little quicker.\nNINA: Well, that's a coincidence, because we just filed a patent on that last week.\nOLIVIA: (smiles and reach for her hand) It's good to be with you. We should do this more often. (Nina stares at her in surprise) What's wrong?\nNINA: (now really worried) We always have breakfast together on Saturday mornings. We were here last week. Are you saying you don't remember? I'm worried. You're having these experiences at what cost?\nOLIVIA: I'll talk to Walter.\nCELIA: (on answering machine) Hey, Jane, it's Celia. God, (a man rubs his face with a liquid) it was a beautiful service... if you need anything, please call us.\n(switches on the lights. a man with a scarred face appears in front of her)\nJANE: Who are you? What do you want? No, please don't! No, please don't! No... No! No!\nWALTER: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Hello, Walter.\nWALTER: Oh, I'm so glad you're here.\nOLIVIA: Is everything alright?\nWALTER: I've run out of M&Ms. But I want to show you something. I ordered this on the interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.\nOLIVIA: A teddy bear?\nWALTER: A teddy bear-witness. It has a camera. To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab. Come. What do you see?\nOLIVIA: I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.\nWALTER: Uh-huh. Look again. Do you see the blip?\nOLIVIA: Okay, I saw it then.\nWALTER: I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye. Ah! They're back from M.I.T.\nASTRID: What did I just pick up, Walter? There were a lot of security precautions.\nWALTER: It's an apparatus designed to slow down video. The playback rate is so decelerated that you can actually see light particles. Come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.\nASTRID: How are you feeling?\nOLIVIA: I'm fine. I was gonna come and talk to Walter, but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.\nWALTER: Astro, my waffle iron blew its fuse.\nOLIVIA: Uh, this is Dunham.\nBROYLES: Jane Hall -- she was found by her sister.\nOLIVIA: That's severe bruising.\nBROYLES: Those aren't bruises. The victim's skin had a reaction to some type of chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.\nOLIVIA: So why are we here?\nBROYLES: This is the second killing in a month where a woman has had the same marks. Both were recently widowed.\nAGENT LEE: And the husbands died under mysterious circumstances.\nBROYLES: The bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated. As a matter of fact, Ms Hall had just arrived home from her husband Mark's funeral when she was killed.\nOLIVIA: Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.\nBROYLES: There's one more thing. In both cases, DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.\nOLIVIA: You're saying that both widows were killed by their dead mates?\nBROYLES: It appears that's what the evidence is saying. But her husband's body was only exhumed fifteen minutes ago.\nWALTER: Oh, my. Peter, I need you here immediately -- where are you?\nPETER: I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.\nWALTER: Bus station? Where are you going?\nPETER: New York. You wanted me to stay away from her, remember? And a bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.\nWALTER: You didn't tell me. Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.\nPETER: Why, what's going on?\nWALTER: I think the Observer may have done something to your eye.\nPETER: Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other Observers.\nWALTER: All I care about is what he's done to you. So what's in New York?\nPETER: I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York -- Olivia.\nWALTER: I admire you, Peter.\nPETER: And why is that, Walter?\nWALTER: I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do... leaving Olivia... but I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.\nPETER: Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?\nWALTER: It's a... particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.\nPETER: \u2018Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy\u2019.\nWALTER: Is that Greek?\nPETER: Yeah. Yeah, it means be a better man than your father. It's something I was told a long time ago. But it is very strange to hear you say it.\nWALTER: Hmm.\nPETER: What is it?\nWALTER: There's something in there. It's got writing on it.\nPETER: It's an address.\nWALTER: Two-two-eight and a half Morrow Street. It's amazing. I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course, would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.\nPETER: You think this would have etched itself into my brain?\nWALTER: Organic ocular suggestion. You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.\nJONES: Doctor Bishop?\nWALTER: What?\nJONES: Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.\nWALTER: Who is she?\nJONES: Jane Hall.\nPETER: I think it's a case, Walter.\nWALTER: Oh. Oh, oh, right. Well, fine. Bring the poor Dear down and put her on the slab.\n(in a private lab, Anson Carr cleans and scrubs a dehydration chamber, then prepares a chemical blend of liquids)\nWALTER: The human body is composed of sixty percent water. However, Mister Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.\nASTRID: He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.\nWALTER: Among other things that are lost with such... dehydration... are pheromones. It wasn't only Mister Hall's DNA found on his widow's neck. Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's Pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.\nOLIVIA: Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?\nWALTER: They control our moods, our appetites... who we give our hearts to.\nAGENT LEE: So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.\nASTRID: Do you think that he's trying to win the female?\nWALTER: A love potion? Possibly. Mm... I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.\nAGENT LEE: Okay. I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.\nWALTER: Oh, I'm sorry. They're Peter's. I made him get off the bus to New York. But you didn't know that.\nOLIVIA: That he was on his way to New York? No. Where is he now?\n(on Morrow Street, Peter locates and enters the address message that was embedded in his eye. the spartan apartment contains stacks of news items... and a closet with simple black suits and Fedoras)\nWALTER: Thank you, Dear.\nOLIVIA: Walter, my memories are slipping. They're disappearing.\nWALTER: Your own memories? You said to me they're in the back of your mind.\nOLIVIA: Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences. I just didn't care. But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening. And I want you to try and stop it. I want you to see if you can reverse it. I just -- I want to go back to who I was.\nWALTER: Olivia...\nOLIVIA: I don't want to feel like this anymore.\nWALTER: I'll think of something.\nANSON CARR: I can do that, if you want.\nMAN: Really?\nANSON CARR: Yeah.\nMAN: Yeah, that'd be great.\nWOMAN: Thank you. Oh, he's so cute.\nANSON CARR: I don't know about cute. This is Omar. (his pug dog) Are you ready? (snaps their picture) Mm-hmm. Oh, you two look so in love. Beautiful.\nMAN: Oh, it's great.\nWOMAN: Perfect.\nANSON CARR: You guys from around here?\nMAN: Yeah, Brookline.\nWOMAN: (summons her child) Come on, Oliver. Alright.\nANSON CARR: Well, take care.\nMAN: Thank you.\nWOMAN: Thanks.\n(Carr moves on. looking for another couple. one without a child)\nLINDA GREELEY: Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.\nANSON CARR: I could take that picture for you, if you want.\nWALTER: Smell this.\nASTRID: Walter, what is that? It is putrid!\nWALTER: Mortius bestia -- roadkill. Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver used primarily for marking and mating. I went beaver hunting in Eastern Canada in the '70s. Of course, in those days, 'beaver' meant something else entirely.\nASTRID: Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?\nWALTER: Because I have been smelling things for the past hour, and I've lost my objectivity. Now are you gonna help me or not?\n(in a private office)\nOLIVIA: Okay, take a look at these. These are statements from friends and family. The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.\nAGENT LEE: So?\nOLIVIA: So maybe he's targeting couples that personify the kind of love that he wants. What?\nAGENT LEE: Nothing. Are you okay? I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days... you know, if you ever... need anything... I'm here.\nOLIVIA: I know.\nASTRID: (enters the office) Um, Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.\nWALTER: For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate, rancid note to counterbalance all of the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance. The ancient Mesopotamians used fish oil. The Greeks used animal carcass. The Egyptians used afterbirth. But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.\nOLIVIA: You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?\nWALTER: No. But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex... does contain a rancid note. I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.\nASTRID: It's an ingredient called Castoreum.\nWALTER: Hmm?\nASTRID: Uh-uh. Anyway, we can trace it. It is not easy to get. I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it. You guys can work these, and I'll take these.\n(Peter continues his search of the Morrow Street apartment and hears beeping coming from a phonograph console. after fiddling with the back of the turntable, a secret storage area pops up. the brief case inside contains high-tech binoculars and an active tracking transponder)\nOLIVIA: (answers phone) Hey, Astrid.\nASTRID: (from the lab) Hey. Where are you?\nOLIVIA: We're just leaving Scentax. We're on our way to KJS next.\nASTRID: Forget about that place. Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft. Guess what he stole.\nOLIVIA: Castoreum? Do you have an address?\nANDREW SUTTER: Let me out! Aah! Aah! Aah! (struggling to get out of a dehydration chamber as Carr sits and listens to reflective music, waiting for his pheromones)\n(Lee and Dunham lead a tactical assault squad into Anson Carr's Chelsea home and lab)\nTACTICAL TEAM: Clear!\nOLIVIA: (touches dehydration chamber) It's still warm. He was just here.\nAGENT LEE: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: He's married.\nAGENT LEE: (checks ID) Andrew Sutter, age thirty-six. 212 Piedmont Avenue Milton.\"\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna call Broyles, tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.\n(deep in the pine woods near Foxboro, Peter carries the briefcase and follows the directions emanating from the transponder he recovered. the beeping cadence increases on the tracker as he arrives at a small clearing. after only a few seconds, the ground vibrates and the 'Beacon' bores up through the damp loam)\nOLIVIA: (surprise visit at front door) It's okay. We're with the FBI. My name is Agent Olivia Dunham.\nDIANNA SUTTER: What -- what are you doing?\nOLIVIA: Are you Dianna Sutter?\nDIANNA SUTTER: (sitting and getting the bad news) Last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning. His car's in the shop today. I told him to get a ride home from work because... because I was too busy.\nOLIVIA: Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.\nAGENT LEE: We're in position.\nDIANNA SUTTER: Now what?\nOLIVIA: Now we wait. Just keep looking straight ahead. You must have loved each other very much.\nDIANNA SUTTER: We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown. This August, it... would have been fifteen years. We were best friends in college. He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another. He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen... what I was looking for. He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them. It's different, you know. But people get tired... of looking and hoping.\nAGENT LEE: Maybe he's taking his time. Like he did with Jane Hall.\nOLIVIA: Or maybe he was never coming here at all. This guy targets couples in love. You heard her talking about her marriage. Why would Carr pick them? Missus Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?\nDIANNA SUTTER: How did you know?\nOLIVIA: Do you know her name?\nLINDA GREELEY: W \u2013 what are you doing in my house?\nANSON CARR: Shh...\nLINDA GREELEY: No!\nANSON CARR: Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.\nLINDA GREELEY: No, please, God! No! Help me!\nANSON CARR: Shh.\nLINDA GREELEY: Help me!\nANSON CARR: Shh, shh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.\nLINDA GREELEY: Aah!\nOLIVIA: Let her go! Move away from her.\nOLIVIA: Do you know how much pain you caused?\nANSON CARR: I don't want you to think that I did it for me. I mean, not just for me. We're not meant to be alone. It's every human being's right to know love. And had I succeeded... had I found the right chemicals -- just the right... balance... I could have given the world... what you have.\nOLIVIA: What do I have?\nANSON CARR: Love. I can smell that you're in love.\nNINA: I was wondering when I'd hear from you. I was just making some tea. How are you feeling?\nOLIVIA: I'm okay. I talked to Walter.\nNINA: What did he say?\nOLIVIA: It doesn't matter. I met a woman today. She'd just lost her husband, and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she -- she wasn't in love. As I was listening to her... I realized what she was saying. She had let go of the possibility of love... of finding love. And I could see myself in her. I didn't like who I was. Now, all of these... memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a -- a better version of me. I've decided to let things run their course.\nNINA: Oh, you had an emotional day, and you don't have to decide anything right now.\nOLIVIA: I've made my decision.\nNINA: You have so much in your life, Olive. Are you just gonna let that all disappear? And be replaced by what? Memories... of a life that you didn't live?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nNINA: Well, how long do we have?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. Neither does Walter.\nNINA: Hmm. Well, my mother used to say, 'Encourage the quest for happiness in your children, even if it takes them very far away from you'.\nOLIVIA: When the day comes... if I don't remember this... I want you to try and build something with me again. Don't give up on me. I love you, Nina.\nNINA: I love you, Olive.\nTHE OBSERVER: Thank you.\nPETER: For what?\nTHE OBSERVER: They hid the universe from me. They locked me out.\nPETER: You mean the other Observers.\nTHE OBSERVER: Yes. What I led you to is a Beacon. I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.\nPETER: So I helped you. Then I need you to help me now. I have tried everything that I can think of... everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked. And nobody here can help me. But you can. I know you can. Please... help me get back home.\nTHE OBSERVER: You have been home all along.\nPETER: I don't understand. I was erased.\nTHE OBSERVER: There is no scientific explanation. But... I have a theory based on a uniquely human principle. I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go. And you... would not let them go. I believe you call it 'love'.\nPETER: And Olivia?\nTHE OBSERVER: She is your Olivia."

Weather reports still indicate strong winds and turbulence. We'll be circling for just a bit longer. We hope to be on the ground within the hour. Thank you for your patience. We will be coming through the cabin with snacks which are available for purchase for five dollars. Remember, VertusAir no longer accepts cash, so please have your credit or debit card handy.\nSTEWARD: You need some headsets?\nPASSENGER: You should put keys on your back.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Excuse me?\nPASSENGER: It's an old wives' tale - - to stop the bloody nose.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Yeah.\nPASSENGER: Yeah. Actually, I tried it once. It doesn't work. It's all bull.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I need to talk to you.\nMELISSA: Yes, sir, I'll be with you in one moment.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: No, now! Please.\nMELISSA: What's the problem?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I'm in trouble. There's something happening to me that I don't have the time, or the permission, to explain to you.\nMELISSA: What is it?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I need you to go to the passengers. I need you to collect as many sedatives or tranquilizers as you can.\nMELISSA: Okay, sir, I need you to take a deep breath.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: This isn't a panic attack! This is real! We will die, all of us, if you don't do what I say.\nSTEWARD: Sir, a threat like that is in violation of FAA regulations.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Does it look to you like I care about that?\nMELISSA: Oh, my God.\nSTEWARD: Go call the Captain. Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down. You're gonna scare the passengers.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I'm going into that bathroom. You keep me in there. You keep that door closed. Get whatever sedatives you can as soon as you can.\nSTEWARD: You go in that bathroom, sir - -\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: I am not messing around! When you get the drugs, you come back, you knock. If I don't answer or if I do and what you see isn't me anymore, you keep that door closed. Aah!\nMELISSA: Yes, sir, but I think forty minutes is too long. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a passenger who's having a hard time.\nAIR MARSHAL: Sir, this is the Air Marshal. I need you to open this door. Sir, I won't tell you again. Open this door, or I'm gonna have to come in.\nTSA AGENT MIKE: Panic attack?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Yeah. Like I said, I hate flying. I always have, ever since I was a kid. But I was doing pretty well until they said that we weren't going to be able to land for a while.\nTSA AGENT KNOLLS: These your bags, sir?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Oh, that's them. Thank you.\nTSA AGENT MIKE: Whoa.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Look, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry I wasted your time and scared all those people. Hey! Sorry. Don't you have to ask permission before you do that?\nTSA AGENT KNOLLS: Not since Bush Two.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Sure. Sure. Whatever. Can we make this quick, please?\nTSA AGENT KNOLLS: Is there anything I need to be aware of, sir?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: What? No.\nTSA AGENT KNOLLS: Knives? Needles?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Underwear. Don't worry. It's clean.\nTSA AGENT MIKE: Are you okay?\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Yeah, I just... need a bathroom.\nTSA AGENT MIKE: Right there.\nTSA AGENT KNOLLS: Mike...\nTSA AGENT MIKE: Panic attack... as in withdrawal.\nMARSHALL BOWMAN: Aah!\nTSA AGENT KNOLLS: Well, time to call the cops. Hey, it's Knolls. We got drugs again. But nothing I've ever seen bef - -\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: You say you're happy... that you've never felt better.\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: And forgetting all the details of your life... your relationships... the cases you've handled - - that's not a problem for you?\nOLIVIA: Well, what I meant - - I mean, yes, it's odd, but it's a problem that I can handle. The real problem, the one that we should all be worried about, is Jones.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: David Robert Jones?\nOLIVIA: Yes, the one who kidnapped me.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: You remember that?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Because you're already starting to become... what... your former self from a prior timeline - - the one you shared with Peter Bishop?\nOLIVIA: I suppose. Yes. My point is, David Robert Jones is still out there somewhere. And instead of pursuing him like I should have, I've been forced to take every psych evaluation and field trial The Bureau can think of. I've had CAT scans, MRIs, peed in every cup. My sitting here now trying to convince an FBI shrink - - no offense - - that I am fit to return to active duty is pointless.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: You have to admit... it's a little weird, what's happened to you.\nOLIVIA: I work in Fringe Division. Weird i - is a matter of degrees.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Have you told your sister? You do have a sister, right?\nOLIVIA: Yes. Rachel. And, no, I haven't told her.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Are the two of you close?\nOLIVIA: Yes. We don't talk that often.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Why not?\nOLIVIA: Life. My job. She moved back to Chicago with my niece Ella so that Ella could be closer to Rachel's ex, who, in my opinion, is a liar and a bastard.\nDOCTOR ANDERSON: Just a few more questions, Agent Dunham. We're almost through.\nBROYLES: Hey.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nBROYLES: Sit down.\nOLIVIA: They said no.\nBROYLES: The truth is, they don't know what to say. Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Bureau has protocols for dealing with mental trauma, depression, post-traumatic stress, amnesia.\nOLIVIA: I don't have mental trauma.\nBROYLES: I understand that.\nOLIVIA: And what does it matter if - - if I can't remember every detail of every case I've ever investigated? I mean, I can learn that. It doesn't make me any less fit to be in the field.\nBROYLES: Your sister is still married. Rachel is still married. She and her husband have two children -- Ella and a younger brother, Eddie. Doctor Anderson sent over her report. Forty percent of all the information you provided about your life is incorrect, which, as far as the Tenth Floor is concerned, means you are not the Agent they licensed.\nOLIVIA: Our grandfather's name was Eddie.\nPETER: Is that you? What took you so long? I was just about to send out a search party - - dogs, men in trench coats. Oh... that good, huh?\nOLIVIA: They don't even want me consulting on cases.\nPETER: Well, I'm sure that's only temporary.\nOLIVIA: Broyles said I should look at it as an overdue vacation. Why would I assume, just because you and I are back together, that everything would be fine? What, the world isn't gonna live up to my every expectation?\nPETER: Olivia, a vacation is not such a bad idea. Vermont's beautiful this time of year. I know you don't like skiing, but as long as we got a rug and a fireplace, I think we'll be fine.\nOLIVIA: You should get that. I think the '70s are calling.\nPETER: Yeah? Yeah, I am, actually. No, I just wasn't expecting... yeah.\nOLIVIA: Lincoln? Well, one of us is still on the team.\nPETER: Liv...\nOLIVIA: Peter, I'm fine. Go.\nPETER: I'll be back as soon as I can.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nAGENT LEE: They should have surveillance footage. See if they'll give you access.\nASTRID: Yeah, okay.\nPETER: Hi.\nASTRID: Hey. How's Olivia?\nPETER: Eh, she's okay. I mean, she's frustrated, but she's okay.\nAGENT LEE: Broyles asked me to take lead till she's back. I hope that you're okay with that.\nPETER: You're the boss. So what happened?\nAGENT LEE: We're not exactly sure yet. Incident on a VertusAir flight from Paris to New York - - details are still coming in.\nWALTER: Is that Peter? Tell him to stay right there.\nPETER: Did you say VertusAir? Was it Flight 718?\nAGENT LEE: Yeah.\nPETER: I guess this is like the timeline that I'm from. It does stands to reason that some of the exact same cases would take place. Vertus 718 - -\nWALTER: Happy Birthday!\nPETER: Walter, it's not my birthday.\nWALTER: No, of course not. I know that. But I've been saving these up. I bought one every year on your birthday to help me deal with the loss.\nPETER: Walter...\nWALTER: ...and I know you're not him, my Peter, but you're as close as I'm going to get. Here we are... beer. For when you turned twenty-one. I - I probably wouldn't drink that, though.\nPETER: Thank you.\nWALTER: You're welcome.\nAGENT LEE: So... The case on the plane?\nPETER: Right, the case on the plane. His name was Marshall Bowman. He was an undercover cop. He was given a designer virus that was programmed to rewrite his DNA, turn him into some kind of creature.\nAGENT LEE: What sort of creature?\nPETER: A giant porcupine. But the plane crashed. He was burnt to a crisp.\nWALTER: I - I like porcupines. Shows that God has a sense of humor.\nASTRID: Uh, Peter, you were right. The guy's name is Bowman, but that flight did not crash.\nPETER: Huh?\nASTRID: It says it right here. It landed a few hours ago.\nWALTER: 16. By then, I figured you'd be all about girls.\nPETER: Are you sure about that?\nASTRID: Positive. TSA just sent over the footage.\nASTRID: Oh, my God!\nAGENT LEE: Is that what you were talking about?\nWALTER: Fantastic.\nASTRID: Okay, that is disgusting.\nWALTER: Learn to see past the obvious, dear. What a remarkable specimen.\nPETER: So when was the last time you saw your brother?\nMELINDA BOWMAN: A little over a week ago. I don't understand - - some kind of virus? Why can't I see him?\nPETER: I'm really sorry. Even if I had the authority to do that, which I don't, it's not a good idea. I'm sorry to do this to you right now, but, last question, I promise. This is your brother's handwriting, right? This bit down here where it says, \"Once we get started, there'll be no turning back\" -- do you have any idea what that might be about? Maybe who he was writing it to?\nMELINDA BOWMAN: No, but - the last couple of times Marshall and I spoke, he didn't seem... himself. He was stressed. I thought it was just work.\nPETER: She's ready. She doesn't know anything.\nAGENT LEE: Looks like you were right.\nPETER: About what?\nAGENT LEE: Bowman. Worked out of Credit Cotier in Marseille, managed their corporate accounts. But before that, he was a detective in the BPD crash unit - - retired six years ago, at least officially. Sounds to me like a cop working undercover.\nPETER: So what killed this thing?\nAGENT LEE: Good question. Agents down the hall say they heard the screams. By the time they opened the door, they say it was on the floor, writhing in pain, and then it just died.\nPETER: On the case we worked before, he was working with a partner. He was infected too, but he didn't know it. Almost transformed a couple of days later.\nAGENT LEE: Then we should find him.\nPETER: Yeah. I've been trying to think of his name, but I can't remember it. Olivia would, though.\nAGENT LEE: Then you should give her a call.\nPETER: Daniel Hicks - - Olivia says he lives at 235 Marlboro Street, so it should be just up here a couple more blocks. You want to talk about it, or should we just pretend like we already did? Olivia.\nAGENT LEE: She's your Olivia. I get it. I mean, I don't really get it... how she can suddenly become this other version of herself. Different circumstances, I might think that you were drugging her... doing something to her, but... I don't know if she told you this, but when I first met her, I'd lost my partner - - Robert. He and his wife, Julie - - they had this incredible relationship. The way she looked at him... Olivia looks at you that same way. So why don't we just leave it at that?\nPETER: You're a good guy.\nAGENT LEE: Yeah. I'm a good guy.\nPETER: What's she doing here?\nOLIVIA: You didn't really think I'd stay home, did you?\nPETER: I suppose not.\nAGENT LEE: Olivia, you are not authorized to be here. If Broyles gets wind of this... Okay. We came all this way. Might as well look around.\nPETER: I'll check the back.\nAGENT LEE: Medical waste - - what's that about?\nOLIVIA: Don't know.\nAGENT LEE: You mean you didn't see these the last time?\nOLIVIA: No.\nAGENT LEE: Huh. Remember you said eventually all this would stop getting strange? In case you were wondering, it still hasn't. You don't remember having that conversation, do you? The night at the diner?\nOLIVIA: Sorry.\nAGENT LEE: That's okay.\nOLIVIA: Lincoln!\nPETER: You okay?\nAGENT LEE: I'm fine.\nAGENT LEE: (about Walter's distraction) Is that really necessary?\nWALTER: If I don't suture this wound, it will become infested with bacteria.\nAGENT LEE: I was talking about the humming.\nWALTER: Oh. Auditory distraction dulls the peripheral senses and allows for optimal focus, which is why surgeons play classical music in the O.R.\nAGENT LEE: Ow.\nWALTER: Sorry.\nPETER: Hey, did anybody report seeing the thing that got away?\nOLIVIA: No word. So do we have any theories why this one died?\nPETER: Not exactly. Walter thinks that the cells broke down - - that the rapid mutation caused all the internal organs to fail.\nOLIVIA: And what about this?\nPETER: Also no idea. But we are running labs on it to try to break down the chemical composition. But check this out. You see these? They're track marks. We think he was injecting himself with whatever that stuff is.\nOLIVIA: What's that... just here?\nPETER: Hmm. It looks like a tattoo. Hey, Walter.\nWALTER: Hmm?\nPETER: Can you come here for a sec, take a look at this?\nWALTER: Hold this. Don't move. Did you find his genitals, son?\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nAGENT LEE: Hey.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry about Hicks' place. I had no idea that he had already become...\nAGENT LEE: ...it's nothing. Don't worry about it.\nOLIVIA: But if I hadn't been with you, then you would have called Broyles and asked for backup and... you didn't want to get me in trouble, and now you're injured.\nAGENT LEE: It wasn't your fault.\nASTRID: Olivia... I ran that name you gave me - - Conrad Etienne Moreau. You're right, he was a scientist. But he died five years ago in a car crash.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: That doesn't make any sense. On the case that we worked, he was the one trying to broker the deal for the virus that made these guys mutate.\nAGENT LEE: You also said that Bowman died in a plane crash. Now, for some reason, the details that you and Olivia remember from your timeline, not all of them are tracking here.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, if Conrad's not behind this, who is?\nWALTER: Perhaps the Sumerians. This tattoo... is cuneiform. I'm not sure of the significance of the symbol, but I'm fairly certain it's Sumerian. Not my favorite ancient language. I prefer Yiddish. Belly's father taught it to me. He was a charming man.\nOLIVIA: You're thinking something.\nPETER: I'm thinking that you and I both know somebody who could help us interpret Bowman's tattoo.\nOLIVIA: Who?\nPETER: An old friend... though he may take some convincing, 'cause I'm pretty sure he has no idea who we are.\nAGENT LEE: Sounds intriguing.\nWALTER: Not you. You need to be stitched up.\nAGENT LEE: Go. If you learn anything, call me.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Thank you.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: All set. Enjoy. Can I help you?\nPETER: I hope so. The lady here is looking for a book called Lake of the Long Sun, by Gene Wolf. Do you know him?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Are you kidding me? I worship him. And a girl as beautiful as you who likes Sci-Fi is a girl after my own heart. I'm Ed, by the way.\nOLIVIA: Olivia. Sorry, taken.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: All the best ones are. Story of my life. Okay. I've got the entire Solar Cycle, first edition. You want signed or unsigned?\nOLIVIA: Do you think maybe he could help?\nPETER: Who, him? No, I doubt it.\nOLIVIA: It's probably a little too obscure.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Help what?\nOLIVIA: Uh, just a symbol we're trying to decipher. It has to do with cuneiform.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Sumerian, Hittite, or Akkadian?\nOLIVIA: Impressive.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: I know. I'm a very, very impressive man.\nOLIVIA: And I'm still taken.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Can't blame a guy for trying.\nOLIVIA: Do you have any idea what this means?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Are you one of them?\nOLIVIA: One of who?\nWALTER: Megif avagin frim dim Tish.\nAGENT LEE: Excuse me?\nWALTER: It's Yiddish. It means \"May I please be excused from the table?\" No, you may not.\nAGENT LEE: Why not?\nWALTER: Because I have just made some peanut butter and bacon sandwiches.\nAGENT LEE: Thanks, anyway.\nWALTER: And because - - and - - and don't be alarmed by this - - but I think you may be infected.\nAGENT LEE: What?\nWALTER: Well, if what killed our friend was, in fact, viral, then it's likely that when you were scratched, that the virus was transmitted to you.\nAGENT LEE: Okay, um... S \u2013 shouldn't you, like, give me something?\nWALTER: I'm afraid not. I can't cure the intermediate stage. Once the virus fully matures, I should be able to counteract it.\nAGENT LEE: \"Should\"?\nWALTER: Most likely. Eighty percent.\nAGENT LEE: And if I'm part of the other twenty percent?\nWALTER: Let's take it one step at a time.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Yep, I was right. Here it is. I remember reading it means \"renewal\" or \"rebirth.\" There's been some rumblings lately about a group out there - - a cult, really.\nOLIVIA: Okay, whereabouts were these rumblings?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: You know, the usual places. Obscure corners of the Internet, conspiracy boards, sub-subterranean chat rooms. Far as I can see, they're just whack jobs. They're obsessed with the guided evolution of man. They want to create a new species... a better species... mutation by design.\nKATE HICKS: Oh, baby, you're hurting. This should be the last one. Just think how special you're gonna be... how special we're both gonna be... like Adam and Eve.\nOLIVIA: Okay - here's a good one - - according to Mayan prophecy, \u201ca serpent rope will appear in the center of the Milky Way.\"\nPETER: Is that when the world ends, or when the aliens arrive?\nASTRID: Apparently, that's when a celestial ship emerges, and a bearded serpent God comes down to bring enlightenment.\nPETER: No, actually, the celestial ship turns into the serpent God, if you want to be technical.\nWALTER: It's perfect.\nASTRID: Not really.\nAGENT LEE: You mean no mutant porcupine man?\nWALTER: Hmm?\nAGENT LEE: My culture, it's clear?\nWALTER: Oh, no. No results yet. I was talking about them. I hadn't realized how much I longed for family.\nAGENT LEE: Yeah, they're - - they're great.\nWALTER: And you too, of course. It's not every day that a perfectly suited chess partner comes along. And don't fret. Right now no news is good news.\nASTRID: Hey, guys, listen to this. \"Each generation of Gods is overthrown by its children, who become new Gods with new tools. Science delivers these tools, and mankind gains dominion over all he surveys.\"\nOLIVIA: What kind of science?\nASTRID: Uh, radical transgenics, hybridization. Guided mutation? Most of this is about encoding foreign genomes with retroviral DNA. These algorithms look pretty advanced.\nWALTER: The file's here: \"816tpt618.\" That's a palindrome... or a palindromic code, to be precise.\nAGENT LEE: What's that mean?\nWALTER: Something that reads the same backwards of forwards. Words like \"madam\" or \"boob.\"\nAGENT LEE: I know what a palindrome is. I meant what does that mean in terms of the case?\nWALTER: In and of itself, nothing. But years ago, when Belly and I were tripping, we created a way of organizing lab files using only palindromes.\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you saying that this information comes from Massive Dynamic?\nNINA: I do recognize the number, but we haven't used this file system for years. After William died, we converted to a more user-friendly one.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe it's from a terminated experiment.\nNINA: We have many projects dealing with the genetic engineering of hybrids. I'll have to run a search. You weren't supposed to be here. Phillip said you were pulled off field duty.\nOLIVIA: I know, but here I am.\nNINA: I suppose every version of you is stubborn. Ah, this code does correspond to an old project. But the contents have been erased.\nPETER: Could it have been hacked into from the outside?\nNINA: No, I don't see how. This system has eight redundant firewalls.\nOLIVIA: Well, who was overseeing the project?\nNINA: David Robert Jones.\nWALTER: I eat, too, when I'm nervous. Don't worry - - we should know something soon.\nAGENT LEE: Hmm.\nWALTER: I take it you don't like peanut butter.\nAGENT LEE: Not so much, but this bacon is fantastic. Do you have any more?\nWALTER: Yes. Of course.\nAGENT LEE: I typically don't like pork.\nWALTER: Aphid, could we get Agent Lee some more - - Agent Lee... What else do you hunger for - - pickled herrings, spinach?\nAGENT LEE: I don't know. Onion rings would be nice. Maybe - - maybe some cheesecake.\nWALTER: That's it.\nAGENT LEE: What?\nWALTER: Call Peter and Olivia. Tell them that I understand.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what is it? Astrid said you made a breakthrough.\nWALTER: Agent Lee is infected. We know for sure now.\nPETER: And we're excited about that why?\nAGENT LEE: He says I'm gonna be fine, by the way.\nWALTER: Because now I understand what the creature craves to fuel his metamorphosis.\nASTRID: It's disgusting.\nWALTER: Lipids! Human fat. That's what was in these bags. Most likely vacuumed during liposuction. Fat stores concentrated energy, and energy is necessary for transformation. Now, I know what you're asking. Wouldn't it be easier just to eat people? Well, the answer, in fact, is no, not with three hundred thousand pounds of fat being disposed of by plastic-surgery clinics every three months.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we need to make a list of all the cosmetic-surgery clinics and see if any of them have had any medical waste stolen.\nASTRID: Yeah, I'm already on it, although I'm thinking they might not be inclined to admit it.\nPETER: Okay, Walter, let's say that you're right and these things are using fat to power their metamorphosis into monsters. How are they able to get around without being seen?\n(twenty storeys above midtown Boston, Kate and Daniel Hicks know how to avoid the evening rush hour traffic. standing on the edge of a highrise rooftop, Daniel picks up Kate in his arms and jumps from the building. a few seconds, the pair return to level flight, powered by Daniel's large, bat-like wings)\nAGENT LEE: I really have to drink that?\nWALTER: Only if you want to live. A blend of wheat grass, penicillin, some mild laxatives. And I put in some mint to kill the aftertaste.\nAGENT LEE: It didn't work.\nPETER: You guys learn anything?\nWALTER: Yes. I understand what these drugs are for. They're meant to safely manage the transformation. They're on a schedule to ensure that the mutation doesn't occur too quickly.\nPETER: So that's why Bowman died? He couldn't get to his medicine. He was in the cabin, and the drugs were stuck down in his checked luggage.\nWALTER: Precisely. Our Mister Bowman had all the fat he needed to transform, but he lacked the medication to control the process. I used Agent Lee's infected blood to create a computer model to replicate the mutation sequence.\nPETER: How's it coming?\nWALTER: Good. It's almost complete. The model just needs to re-create the last few injections.\nASTRID: Well, we've got good news and bad news. Which do you want first?\nWALTER: Bad.\nPETER: Good.\nOLIVIA: Turns out that Walter was right. There was a robbery at a surgi-center just outside of Allston about ten days ago, and among other things, about half a dozen bags of surgically removed fat were stolen.\nWALTER: Which is that, good or bad?\nOLIVIA: Two of the guards were killed during the robbery, and the place has been under lockdown ever since.\nASTRID: Which means that if they need more fat, they're gonna have to get it from someplace else. The problem is that there are over forty-five potential clinics in a ten-mile radius.\nOLIVIA: What are your thoughts, Walter?\nWALTER: But I'm not clear. Which was the good news?\nPETER: Walter... take a look at this. How many of those clinics were in high-rises?\nWALTER: Oh, my. In the 'Department of Guided Evolution', this is indeed a great leap forward.\nASTRID: Yeah, there's just one - - LDP Institute. It's located in Beacon Hill on the 12th floor.\nAGENT LEE: They're probably closed by now. We should get a move on. At this point, I have no choice. I need to call for reinforcements. I have to inform Broyles.\nPETER: If you call Broyles, he's gonna know that Olivia was working on the case.\nOLIVIA: I just spoke to Broyles. He's gonna have backup meet you at the facility. He said he'd deal with me later. So go.\nAGENT LEE: We're in.\nTACTICAL RADIO: Copy. Power's been shut off.\nAGENT LEE: Copy that. Going radio silent. Go to N.V.\nWALTER: Have we heard anything? I don't know about you, but this tension's killing me. Ho, ho, ho, ho... Oh. Very clever. He's using the sleeping-Indian defense. He saw my Rook about to take his Queen, and he countered with his Knight. So what should I do?\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry, my dear. I'll make less noise. Shh.\nOLIVIA: No, what you just said. Porcupines are nocturnal. They'd be asleep during the day.\nWALTER: So do vampires.\nOLIVIA: Astrid! Okay, that's why Hicks' windows were all blacked out.\nASTRID: What is it?\nOLIVIA: - - Can we get Lincoln on the radio?\nASTRID: Lincoln, do you copy? Lincoln, do you copy?\nPETER: Hello?\nOLIVIA: Peter, it's me.\nPETER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nOLIVIA: Turn on the lights. The creature is nocturnal. If it's there, the lights might scare it out of hiding.\nKATE HICKS: Aah!\nAGENT LEE: Aah! Nice shot.\nPETER: I was aiming for her leg.\nKATE HICKS: No!\nWALTER: (as he unwraps year's of presents he had been saving) Do you remember this? I thought it would teach Peter about magnetism and centrifugal force.\nASTRID: Oh, Walter. (as she starts the frustrating task of cleaning-up Walter's mess) I'm sure that you and Peter will have hours of fun ahead of you.\nWALTER: I know. He's going to be so excited.\nPETER: (joins the two) Hey.\nWALTER: (holds-up belated gift) Ah!\nPETER: Ah... I love these things.\nASTRID: (to Olivia as she enters) So how is she?\nOLIVIA: Well, Lincoln's still at the hospital with her, but the doctors say she's fine. The bullet didn't cause any permanent damage, and they're treating the virus with Walter's cure.\nPETER: But there is some bad news. She had absolutely no idea who created the serum. It turns out Bowman was the one who obtained it for them.\nASTRID: So, more questions.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, about a thousand more, starting with, if David Robert Jones is behind this, what's he up to?\nWALTER: You mean assuming that creating a flying human-porcupine hybrid was not his end goal.\nOLIVIA: Yes, and where is he recruiting these people from? And are there more out there? And who would sign up to become one of these things?\nWALTER: 'And mankind gains dominion over all he surveys'.\nASTRID: Yeah, what does that mean?\nWALTER: You said that Jones was a megalomaniac, that he has a God complex. Well, the fact that we're here at all, that humanity evolved from slugs in the ocean - - depending on who you talk to - - is either a miracle... or an accident. Maybe Jones is trying to take control of the situation. (when the boss joins his science team) Agent Broyles... what a lovely tie.\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham... a word. (steps out to the corridor)\nOLIVIA: (humble) Look, I'm - - I'm sorry that I disobeyed your orders. I shouldn't have got myself involved in that case. And if I hadn't, then Lincoln would never have been injured. And I get it - - there's a lot that I need to catch up on So, from now on, no matter what, I'm going to listen to what you have to say.\nBROYLES: Are you done?\nOLIVIA: Yes.\nBROYLES: I've been on the phone with the Tenth Floor for the past hour. What we've decided is this... if you're sixty percent of the Olivia I knew, you're still better than ninety percent of the agents I've ever worked with. And a Fringe Division with an Olivia Dunham is better than a Fringe Division without her.\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nBROYLES: Good work today... Agent.\n(a young couple sits and discusses the impact genetic transformation will have on their lives)\nMELINDA BOWMAN: What is it? You're having second thoughts.\nMARCO: Of course I am. It killed your brother.\nMELINDA BOWMAN: We have been over this. Something must have gone wrong.\nMARCO: Mel...\nMELINDA BOWMAN: We can be born anew. The two of us... together. We can be children of the new world.\n(Melinda prepares and injects her dose of serum into her tattooed arm)\n(in the hold of a cargo ship, two human-hybrid creatures growl softly as their handler locks the door to the barred jail cell they occupy)\nTOM: Quiet, you two.\n(finished in the cargo hold, the man makes his way to the upper decks, passing various other genetically amended creatures being held in storage. he steps out for a breath of fresh sea air. the logo on the door he closes matches the tattoo sported by the children of the new world. the top deck of the vessel is packed with storage containers as it plods through the night fog of the open ocean)"

It's Grazing Day.\nAGENT LEE: Grazing day?\nOLIVIA: Walter thinks that she's depressed.\nWALTER: Well, technically, it's Seasonal Affective Disorder. Bovines aren't meant to spend extended periods inside. They need lots of Vitamin D. Sunshine.\nPETER: Taking a day trip out to Warwick. That's where her favorite pasture is.\nAGENT LEE: I see.\nOLIVIA: I almost forgot, I, uh... I found this in my apartment. I think it might be yours. It has a name engraved on the back. Robert Danzig. He was your partner, wasn't he?\nAGENT LEE: Yeah. It was his.\nOLIVIA: How did I wind up with it?\nAGENT LEE: Actually, I gave it to you. A few months back, when you came to see me at the hospital. It was a thank you for saving my life. You don't remember me telling you what this symbolizes? It's Native American. The maze represents the journey of life. The obstacles, making the right choices. Until we find ourselves in the center.\nOLIVIA: What's in the center?\nAGENT LEE: Home. A place to belong. Danzig knew I was never much for putting down roots. I never really stayed in the same place too long. He used to joke that if I kept living like that, that one day I would just float off into space. So he gave me this as a reminder that I always had a home. With him, with his family. This, he said, was my tether.\nWALTER: Olivia. The sedative. Gene's getting anxious.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me.\nAGENT LEE: Here. Let me give you a hand with those.\nASTRID: Thank you.\nAGENT LEE: Let me guess. Gene's picnic lunch?\nASTRID: Yeah, I wish. Apparently, the other side is requesting a detailed debrief of our recent run-ins with David Robert Jones. And given the gaps in Agent Dunham's memory, Broyles thinks its best if somebody else goes. Lucky me.\nAGENT LEE: You sound less than enthused.\nASTRID: I was supposed to take my dad to Castle Island today. I promised him.\nAGENT LEE: Breaking promises. One of the many perks of the job.\nASTRID: Yes, sadly.\nAGENT LEE: What if I went for you?\nBROYLES: Not to diminish Agent Farnsworth's assignment, but Liaison Duty is more of a formality. Part of our Mutual Cooperation Agreement. AGENT LEE: I disagree. Coordinating with the other side could yield new leads on Jones. Right now, we have nothing to go on. BROYLES: You're more valuable to me on this side. AGENT LEE: I appreciate the sentiment, but there is nothing going on here today. Unless you count \u2018Grazing Day\u2019. BROYLES: 'Grazing Day'? LINCOLN LEE: Look, Agent Dunham and the others are busy. Agent Farnsworth already has family obligations. I don't have anywhere to be. Frankly, I think I could use the time away.\nRICK: Hi. PAIGE RANDALL: Please... please wha -- what do you want? RICK: That was a mistake. PAIGE RANDALL: I'm sorry! Oh! RICK: Ah! Ahh! PAIGE RANDALL: Oh, God... oh, God.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Initiating scan. Scan complete. AGENT SALERNO: Agent Lee, please come this way. You can go ahead and get set up in here. I'll let Captain Lee and Agent Dunham know you've arrived. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Agent Lee. AGENT LEE: Agent Dunham. Nice to see you again. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. Would've been nicer if you brought me a Cafe Latte instead of that pile of paperwork, but... AGENT LEE: Uh, maybe next time. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Change of plans. You're gonna brief on the way. AGENT LEE: On the way where?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, so, Jones is responsible for dosing Agent Dunham with Cortexiphan. For what purpose? AGENT LEE: Peter Bishop believes he was trying to activate some kind of latent ability. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What, are we talking heat vision, or communicating with fish? AGENT LEE: Your guess is as good as mine. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, did it work? AGENT LEE: Yes. And no. There were some unforeseen side effects. Long story. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: That's why they sent you here instead of her? Or did you just draw the short straw? AGENT LEE: What's that? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: The \u2018Department Of Containment's\u2019 reopening this part of the city. ONBOARD COMPUTER: Zone 13-A, more commonly referred to as Parkside, was closed on November 12th, 2004, due to severe toxic air conditions. There is one live media alert on this subject. Would you like to play it? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Go on. Don't be shy. AGENT LEE: Uh, yes. SECRETARY BISHOP (video file): This is a turning point in our history. In the last week alone, eleven previously uninhabitable zones have been reopened. Our cities are healing. Our world is being restored. But the process will take time. So, as we celebrate this recovery, let us never forget those we've lost. Thank you, everyone. AGENT LEE: I take it things are starting to get better because of The Bridge? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, it's stabilized spatial rifts in the Ambered areas. Don't know how it works. Don't care. I'm just happy. AGENT LEE: Hmm. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey, want to settle a bet? AGENT LEE: Sure. If I can. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's your middle name? AGENT LEE: Tyrone. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Seriously? AGENT LEE: Yeah, it was my great grandfather's name. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Huh. AGENT LEE: Why?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's up, Tyrone? LINCOLN LEE: How the hell did you -- Hey. AGENT LEE: Hey. LINCOLN LEE: Why would you tell her that? AGENT LEE: You don't like Tyrone? I think it's a strong middle name. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: He's been my partner for six years, and yet he wouldn't tell me his middle name. AGENT LEE: My bad. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Ha. Okay, so, what's the skinny? LINCOLN LEE: We've got the body of an unidentified assailant. A woman named Paige Randall placed an emergency call last night, after she was assaulted walking to her car. She reports that during the attack, someone saved her. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, you think this may have something to do with the vigilante cases PD's been working? LINCOLN LEE: My thoughts exactly. Local police received a dozen similar reports in the last few months. Criminals going missing, junkies mysteriously vanishing, victims calling in, claiming that their assailants were attacked mid-crime. AGENT LEE: Maybe Batman's moved to the Bronx. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's a Batman? AGENT LEE: The Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight. Billionaire playboy puts on a cape to clean up the streets of Gotham. LINCOLN LEE: Oh, you mean Mantis. AGENT LEE: Seriously? Your superhero is an insect? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, what, 'cause nothing says badass - like a flying rat? LINCOLN LEE: I don't think Mantis or Batman could've done this. AGENT LEE: Were all the other bodies like this? LINCOLN LEE: There've been no other bodies. This is the first one we've found. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: So, assuming this is our guy, makes you wonder why he left this body behind. What's changed?\n(Department of Containment specialists canvas the newly de-Ambered neighborhood with full HazMat bodysuits and molecular cohesion sensors) DOC TECHNICIAN #1: Seven parts per million. Nominal readings. So far so good. DOC TECHNICIAN #2 How 'bout a souvenir? You remember this match? That was the most brutal fourteen rounds I've ever seen. DOC TECHNICIAN #1: Thanks. I'd rather forget it. I lost two Fillmores on that fight. Four parts per million. I think we're all clear here. (after removing their headgear and breathing apparatus) DOC TECHNICIAN #2: I'll call it in to Dispatch. DOC TECHNICIAN #1: Hey, just a second. I'm reading high amounts of tissue organics. DOC TECHNICIAN #2: Must be a false positive. DOC TECHNICIAN #1: I don't think so. Pat Wilkinson got the same reading yesterday. According to this, it's coming from inside the church. DOC TECHNICIAN #2: Someone's been in here. DOC TECHNICIAN #1: This zone's been uninhabitable for eight years. DOC TECHNICIAN #2: Hello? Anyone here? DOC TECHNICIAN #1: What is that? DOC TECHNICIAN #2: Oh, my gawd.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey. I'm sorry about the timing. It looks like this is gonna tie us up for a while, so debrief's gonna have to wait. AGENT LEE: Yeah. Of course. I get it. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh -- Reynolds? Agent Lee is gonna need a ride back to the DoD, and then also an escort to The Bridge. AGENT LEE: Uh, wait, what? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Oh, I just assumed under the circumstances you'd want to return to your side until we're freed up. AGENT LEE: Oh, no, that's okay. I don't have to go. I mean, it's no problem - for me. I'd like to stay and be of assistance. If I can. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln? Sure. AGENT REYNOLDS: Um, excuse me. Agent Lee? I just wanted to tell you, uh... well, thanks. AGENT LEE: Um... You're welcome. What was that about? Does he think I'm him? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, he knows who you are. He's just thanking you, because our world, in part, is healing because our two sides are working together. I mean, your team may toil away in secret over there, but over here, you're heroes. AGENT LEE: Hmm.\nHELEN: Afternoon. What's your name? CANAAN: Canaan. My name is Canaan. HELEN: Nice to meet you. I'm Helen. I haven't seen you around here before. Do you have a place to stay? CANAAN: I - I did. I just.... It's gone now. HELEN: I'm sorry to hear that. CANAAN: Can I carry this for you? HELEN: Sure. Thanks. Well, we'll have to find you a place to sleep tonight. It's too cold to be on the street. Father Luis has got the availability of all the shelters. I'll check in with him. You go ahead and dig in. CANAAN: Thank you. HELEN: Be right back. FELLOW DINER: Hey, Mister. You got something on your neck. HELEN: (as he dashes out) Canaan!\nAGENT LEE: I count eighteen bodies and nineteen heads. A few months ago, I'd have a much harder time stomaching something like this. LINCOLN LEE: Took me a while too. Not 'Liv, though. Things like this never phase her. She's the tough one. All our years working together, never once seen her barf, or shed a tear. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey, Lincoln. Mine. LINCOLN LEE: What do you got, Red? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, someone or something was living here. And whatever it was must have realized that its lair was about to be compromised with this zone being reopened. LINCOLN LEE: Which is why it left its last victim behind last night. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. AGENT LEE: I found this on that body over there. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Nice work. We can run this through Facial Rec, maybe I.D. the victim. AGENT LEE: Tell me something. Do you people have any way of determining time of death? I mean, with the remains in this condition? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh, yeah, provided there are certain active enzymes or lactic acid still in the tissue. Sure. Why? What're you thinking? AGENT LEE: I'd like to see all the surveillance feeds from the areas around this zone.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I'm confused. Why are we doing this, exactly? The likelihood of finding surveillance of the victim after she disappeared has a probability rate of, at best, one in eighty-six point seven thousand. AGENT LEE: Humor me. So to speak. LINCOLN LEE: Time of death on our headless corpse. You want to tell me why you needed it? AGENT LEE: Not worth mentioning just yet. I'll let you know if it pans out. LINCOLN LEE: Maybe you'll also tell me why it is you don't want to go back home. AGENT LEE: What're you talking about? LINCOLN LEE: Back at the church, Olivia tried to arrange for your return trip to the other side, but you weren't having any. There a problem? AGENT LEE: No problem, just... they can handle things fine without me. LINCOLN LEE: Well, that's the difference between us. My world wouldn't survive without me. AGENT LEE: Yeah. I noticed that about you. Your unwavering confidence. LINCOLN LEE: Thanks. AGENT LEE: Bordering on self-aggrandizing narcissism. Don't get me wrong, I could use some of that myself. We're not much alike, you and me. LINCOLN LEE: Not that I can see. AGENT LEE: Where did you grow up? LINCOLN LEE: Why? AGENT LEE: I'm just looking for where our paths diverged. LINCOLN LEE: Teaneck, New Jersey. AGENT LEE: Me too. \u2018Til my mom died, and then my dad moved us -- LINCOLN LEE: To Philadelphia. He started a business there. AGENT LEE: Lee's Hardware. LINCOLN LEE: Huh. How about that? Hamilton High? AGENT LEE: Yup. LINCOLN LEE: Tenth grade science teacher. AGENT LEE: Mister Glasberg. Graduating GPA? LINCOLN LEE: Three point eight five. I slacked off my senior year... AGENT LEE: ...to work at my dad's store. Prom date. LINCOLN LEE: A - ha . I didn't go to Prom, I'd just broken up with -- LEE'S IN UNISON: Alicia Dvoskin. AGENT LEE: Is this normal? Sharing so much of the same history? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Captain Lee, Agent Lee, system is registering an eighty-two percent Face Rec to the photo in the locket. LINCOLN LEE: What are those growths on her face? AGENT LEE: I don't know. But you approximated her time of death between One and Three A.M. Five days ago. LINCOLN LEE: Yeah? AGENT LEE: Check the time code. That footage was taken more than two days later. LINCOLN LEE: That's impossible. AGENT LEE: She can't be walking around after she died. LINCOLN LEE: I ran those tests twice. It doesn't make any sense. AGENT LEE: Actually, it does. I just needed something like this to confirm it. LINCOLN LEE: Confirm what?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: A shapeshifter? You think our vigilante is a shapeshifter. AGENT LEE: Yes, sir. COLONEL BROYLES: Do you two concur? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: We have surveillance of the victim more than two days after time of death. COLONEL BROYLES: Granted. But I'm still not convinced, with apologies, Captain Lee, that an error wasn't somehow made in the lab. I just don't see anything in this case that correlates at all with what we know about shapeshifters. AGENT LEE: You're right. Not the versions you've encountered, Agent Broyles. COLONEL BROYLES: Colonel. AGENT LEE: Sorry. Colonel Broyles. Ever since my partner was killed by one of these things, I've become somewhat of an expert on shapeshifters. I've studied each and every file, every detail my team had on the subject. Now, the earlier biosynthetic versions required a three pronged device in order to acquire the victim's appearance. The device needed to be jammed onto the victim's palate, leaving a three-pronged indentation on the roof of the mouth. LINCOLN LEE: Which is what we found inside Bree Collins at the church. COLONEL BROYLES: And the other bodies? Did they have the same markings? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Nothing conclusive. COLONEL BROYLES: Well, I've read these files too, Agent Lee. And the unique state in which we found those bodies in the church bears no resemblance to corpses left by the earlier shapeshifter prototypes. Now, how do you explain that? AGENT LEE: I can't. COLONEL BROYLES: And further, how would you reconcile this version's M.O. with David Robert Jones' agenda? Why would Jones be targeting criminals? I'm sorry, but I suspect in your desire to avenge your partner, you may be unconsciously perverting the evidence to fit the profile of a shapeshifter. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Colonel, I don't think -- COLONEL BROYLES: Agent Lee, we appreciate the assistance you've given us. But as you were here for a simple sharing of Intel, it may be in the interest of both our agencies if you returned home. As for you two, alert me when you have something more - concrete. AGENT LEE: Well, that went well.\nCANAAN: You know, you're really good. DANIEL: Thanks.\nMIKEY: Dawes, ya jackass... Told you not to take so much. It's all we got \u2018til morning. ANTONIO DAWES: Shut up, Mikey. MIKEY: I gotta take a leak.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Colonel Broyles... PD's reporting an eyewitness account that may be related to our vigilante suspect. COLONEL BROYLES: How long ago? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Six minutes. COLONEL BROYLES: Where? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Precinct Seventeen, Northwest Quadrant. In the Pelham District. COLONEL BROYLES: Have P.D. lock down the perimeter, five-block radius. LINCOLN LEE: We have an I.D. on the victim? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Affirmative. Victim's name is Antonio Dawes. His record includes possession and distribution of narcotics, auto theft, burglary. LINCOLN LEE: Fits our profile. COLONEL BROYLES: Contact the local P.D. Tell 'em to be on the lookout for suspicious activity. AGENT LEE: 'Scuse me, Colonel. COLONEL BROYLES: Agent Lee, I thought you were on your way home. AGENT LEE: I think should circulate Dawes' mug shot. If we're dealing with a shapeshifter, that's what he'll look like. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What have we got to lose? COLONEL BROYLES: Agent Farnsworth, upload the photo onto the citywide database. AGENT FARNSWORTH: I'll scan traffic cams in the area too. COLONEL BROYLES: Good. Captain Lee, assemble a TAC Team. And keep me apprised of the situation. LINCOLN LEE: Yes, sir. Always do. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Come on. You're with me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, we want him alive. If you want Jones... AGENT LEE: ...I'm getting Jones. I'm not gonna let this thing kill again. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Dunham. AGENT FARNSWORTH: We have a sighting of a man matching Dawes's photo moving up Copenhagen towards 146th Street. Captain Lee is setting-up a perimeter now. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Copy that. We're on our way.\nLINCOLN LEE: I remind you, our objective is to surround the subject and bring him in alive. We'll split into three teams. You two, you go with Agent Dunham, you'll be taking the high ground. You three, go to the South entrance of the alley. If he makes a break for it, you cut him off. Rest of you are with me. We're going in from the North. AGENT FARNSWORTH: Tactical teams, be advised, we have lost visual on the suspect. Projected trajectory is South of last position. LINCOLN LEE: Lincoln, you copy that? AGENT LEE: Copy. LINCOLN LEE: That could put him in your vicinity. AGENT LEE: Got it. LINCOLN LEE: Listen, Broyles shouldn't have come down on you like that. If it wasn't for you and your shapeshifter bent, we wouldn't be onto this one. What I'm saying is... you're a good Agent. AGENT LEE: Good as you? LINCOLN LEE: Let's not get crazy. I been doing this a lot longer than you. AGENT LEE: Which leads me back to why. Our lives seemed pretty parallel, but somewhere along the line, we became very different people. LINCOLN LEE: Maybe it's free will. I don't buy that we're all just defined by our circumstances. Maybe I just made a choice to become the man I wanted to be. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Girls, you might want to get off the line, 'cause some of us are actually trying to work here. LINCOLN LEE: Sorry, Mother. AGENT LEE: Got him. Southwest of our position. LINCOLN LEE: Astrid? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Searching. Visual confirmed. Suspect is fifty meters from Agent Lee. AGENT LEE: He's made us! He's on the move! AGENT FARNSWORTH: Suspect has entered the southwest building. Agent Lee is in pursuit. LINCOLN LEE: Drop the weapon now! AGENT LEE: Don't shoot! LINCOLN LEE: Drop it. AGENT FARNSWORTH: Suspect is being secured on site. COLONEL BROYLES: Excellent work. Relay my congratulations to Captain Lee and his team. AGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, sir. COLONEL BROYLES: We have him in custody. 148th Street warehouse, just west of Amsterdam. They'll be moving him at the rear. NINA SHARP: Thank you, Colonel. We'll take it from here.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Broyles just dispatched secure transport, so we're moving in ten.\nAGENT LEE: I want five minutes. Just to talk to him.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What for?\nAGENT LEE: Jones created the shapeshifter that killed my partner. If this thing has any information that could lead us to him, I want to know.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm under orders. I mean, you can talk to him once he's been processed.\nAGENT LEE: Once you take him back, he's gonna go so high up the food chain I'll never get to him. You know that as well as I do. If it were your partner, you'd do the same.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Five minutes.\nAGENT LEE: Could you give us a moment? You had the chance to kill me back there, and you didn't. Why? Who are you? Who were you? You were human once, right? Do you always keep mementos from the lives of people you've become?\nCANAAN: It's mine.\nAGENT LEE: This is your son.\nCANAAN: I wish he was. There was once someone in my life. It's her boy.\nAGENT LEE: And Jones. He took you from them when he did this to you.\nCANAAN: No. He came later. She left me on her own. Took Daniel with her. They just went on living their lives as though I were never there. As if I meant nothing to them. I've never really been a... there are these people you come across. These bright, bright lights. They drift through life effortlessly. Unforgettable. I'm not one of them. I wanted to be needed. Or at least to be missed. Do you understand?\nAGENT LEE: I do.\nCANAAN: For that, I needed to be more than I am. Something unique. Doctor Jones understood that. He promised to make me like no one else. I was to be the first of a new breed of human beings. But I was a disappointment.\nAGENT LEE: 'Cause you didn't turn out the way he planned. You've been targeting criminals. Sparing innocent lives. Stealing their DNA. That's what's keeping you alive, isn't it? David Robert Jones is not someone worth protecting. You were disposable to him. As disposable as you were to Daniel.\nCANAAN: You don't know that. He promised he would come for me. To fix me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm sorry.\nRESPONDING AGENT: You have a twenty on the shooter? SPOTTER: Negative! TEAM LEADER: Hold your fire! Hold fire! Secure the prisoner! AGENT LEE: The shooter -- where is he? RESPONDING AGENT: Down, down! TEAM LEADER: Check the windows! BOLIVIA DUNHAM: He's on the roof. Cover me? SPOTTER: Rooftop! Rooftop! He's on the roof! TEAM LEADER: Now, now, now! SPOTTER: Suspect down! AGENT LEE: Everyone okay? Officer down! Officer down! LINCOLN LEE: Who knew? AGENT LEE: What? LINCOLN LEE: Who else knew we were transporting him? We gotta find out. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey, Linc. MedEvac's on the way. You're gonna be fine. LINCOLN LEE: 'Liv... I been blown up before. This is nothing. Was a hell of a shot. I guess you still haven't lost your touch. AGENT LEE: Hey! This was meant for you! Do you understand that? Jones! The man that you are protecting just tried to have you killed! It's time to wake up. He is never gonna welcome you back into the fold. CANAAN: But he has to. I don't know what to do. AGENT LEE: Yes, you do. You can keep waiting for somebody else to define you, to give you your place in the world, or you can decide that you're not just somebody's broken puppet anymore. Choose!\nSECURITY SENTRY: Welcome back, Sir. NINA SHARP: I trust you have good news for me. CANAAN: I do. NINA SHARP: That'll be all. CANAAN: It's done. We've tied up our loose end. NINA SHARP: Nice job. Was there any resistance? CANAAN: The Redhead almost took my head off with a nearly impossible shot. NINA SHARP: That girl always amazes me. She and the one from the other side. Well, he'll be pleased we've taken care of the problem at hand. Now we just need for him to -- someone's overriding the security system. There's been a breach. Canaan... BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Where is she?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Understood. Well, let me know the moment she's in the building. AGENT FARNSWORTH: Agent Broyles, I have something to report. COLONEL BROYLES: I already heard. We have Nina Sharp in custody. There something else? AGENT LEE: You're not gonna believe this. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: What is it? AGENT LEE: Blueprints, passports, aliases... BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah. Hell of a window into Jones's operation. AGENT LEE: It's more than that. Check this out. It's a tracking board. We knew that every shapeshifter was outfitted with a tracking module. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Mm-hmm. AGENT LEE: I think this is some kind of central hub. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: You're saying that -- that you think every one of these dots represents a shapeshifter? AGENT LEE: If we can hack this mainframe, we'll have the identity of every agent in Jones's network. AGENT REYNOLDS: Can I have a word, Agent Dunham? AGENT LEE: What's going on? AGENT SALERNO: Captain Lee. He didn't make it.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Initiate scan. Scan complete. CANAAN: I'd heard rumors of another world. Wasn't sure it really existed. AGENT LEE: It does. CANAAN: What're we doing here? AGENT LEE: Making good on my offer. There's a man here who'll be able to help you. PETER: Agent Lee. AGENT LEE: Canaan, this is Peter and Walter Bishop. WALTER: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm really looking forward to studying -- uh... helping you. AGENT LEE: I think you'll like it there. You don't have to wait for somebody to give you a home, or live on the outside anymore. Here. To keep you from floating away. CANAAN: Thank you. For everything.\nAGENT LEE: Hello? BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Hey. I thought that you would be long gone by now. AGENT LEE: You know what? I -- I wasn't thinking. My face is probably the last thing you want to see right now. Maybe I should go -- BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Lincoln. It's fine. What's up? AGENT LEE: We collected a lot of Intel on Jones. There's more work to be done. I thought I'd stick around for a while. I figured you'd need some help. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thanks. That'd be nice."

FBI Agent Lee and FD Agent Farnsworth watch the somber proceedings from a parked town car)\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I don't like funerals. I never know what I'm supposed to say.\nAGENT LEE: (reflective) There's nothing you can say.\nMRS. LEE: (graveside with Lincoln's father and colleagues) This isn't right. Our children aren't supposed to die before we do.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We are going to do everything that we can to find who's responsible and bring them to justice. I give you my word.\nMRS. LEE: Thank you.\nNINA SHARP: I'm rather unclear. In exchange for this reduced sentence, what do you expect from me?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I believe that David Robert Jones has a mole in the Department of Defense. Among other things, someone tipped him off bout the location of a prisoner transport, which allowed his men to ambush my team and kill my partner. So you're going to tell me who tipped off Jones. This is your last chance. One-time only offer signed by the Secretary of Defense. You're making a mistake. I will find him. And soon Jones and everyone who worked for him will find themselves rotting in a cell just like you.\nNINA SHARP: Well, you needn't worry about me, Agent Dunham. You see, I'm not gonna be here very long. It's your world you ought to be concerned about. Because as bad as you think things are now, things are going to get much worse.\nBRIAN BAUER: Can anyone here tell me what we are in the business of doing? (pauses) We are in the business of making money. Do you agree, Mister Delman?\nJEREMY DELMAN: (timidly) Yes, Mister Bauer.\nBRIAN BAUER: Can you explain to me why Hamilton and I had to cancel our flight to Baltimore this morning?\nJEREMY DELMAN: (stutters) Um, well, uh, because...\nBRIAN BAUER: ...because you and your associates failed to finish the presentation.\nJEREMY DELMAN: Yes, Mister Bauer.\nBRIAN BAUER: So you're telling me that this company has to forfeit on one of its largest accounts because you didn't do your job? Is that right?\nJEREMY DELMAN: Yes, sir.\nBRIAN BAUER: Well, then it should come as no surprise to anyone in this room, especially you, Mister Delman, you are -- (Bauer is lifted up by a force and held against the ceiling) what the hell is happening? What am I doing -- I can't move! Somebody get me down! (Bauer falls and crashes on the desk, killing him)\nWALTER: It's a miracle we made it in one piece. You drive like a daredevil.\nASTRID: For the eleventh time, Walter, I drive the speed limit.\nWALTER: Most automobile fatalities occur driving between work and home.\nASTRID: Yeah, so does most driving.\nWALTER: Ascot, look. It's my son and his girlfriend. I called your house last night, Peter. You didn't answer.\nPETER: That's 'cause I was out.\nWALTER: With Agent Dunham, I presume, making up for lost time.\nASTRID: Uh, you wanna let us know what we're in for?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, about an hour ago two men were killed in this building simultaneously. Witnesses say that they were both lifted several feet in the air and then driven back down to the ground by some unseen force. They died on impact.\nWALTER: Bones in the lower half of his body are completely shattered. Feel this.\nPETER: Oh, please, can I?\nWALTER: He's dead, Peter. You can't hurt him.\nPETER: Not really what I was concerned about.\nASTRID: I'm seeing similar injuries over here. How come out of this entire building, it only happened to these two?\nWALTER: The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all unrighteous men. Romans 1:18.\nPETER: That's the theory? The Hand of God reached down from the skies and punished these people for their sins?\nWALTER: One could argue that God kills us all. Although typically not in such a direct manner. Spinal column's crushed. Hip bone pushed up through his torso. All injuries consistent with impact.\nPETER: Yeah, sure, but from that height the fall couldn't possible have produced a velocity to do that.\nWALTER: No, you're right. His injuries would require much more velocity.\nOLIVIA: So tell me exactly what happened.\nJEREMY DELMAN: He was, um, yelling, and I thought for sure he was gonna fire me. He's yelled at us before, but not like this. I've never seen him so angry. And then all of a sudden, he was pulled up out of his chair by, like, this invisible hand or something.\nOLIVIA: Excuse me.\nPETER: What you got?\nWALTER: It's a laceration of some sort. Could you check the other victim's abdomen for abrasions, Dear?\nASTRID: Yeah, I got one here too. It's just above the waist. What do you think could have caused that?\nWALTER: I'm not sure yet.\nPETER: A seatbelt. Look at the way the laceration extends across the waist. If these people weren't in an office building, you'd swear they were in a car crash together.\nOLIVIA: We have a third victim. Broyles just called, and apparently they found a man who died in his apartment in Brooklyn. His injuries and time of death are consistent with the men here, and he was a pilot.\nWALTER: Yes, yes. Yes. The crushed spinal column, the broken femurs. These men's wounds are consistent with a plane crash. That's brilliant, Dear.\nPETER: Walter, how could these people have been in a plane crash if neither of them was in a plane?\nWALTER: Right. There is that. I might have an idea.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Sir, the other side was correct. There was a plane crash.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: When did it happen?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Approximately ninety minutes ago just after takeoff from an airfield in Teaneck.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Casualties?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Two men and the pilot.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You're just the person I wanted to see. Coordinate with NTSB to take possession of the wreckage and the bodies.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes, sir.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I've narrowed it down to 108 names.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: 108 names?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Everyone who had operational clearance and would have known about the prisoner transport. I want to initiate background checks and electronic surveillance.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You're talking about investigating our own people, many of whom work for DoD and outrank both of us.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sir, Jones has been a step ahead of us the whole way. He knew we were coming, and he moved his entire shapeshifter operation. When we were tracking him, he knew what frequency we were on. Someone inside tipped-off Nina Sharp and got Lincoln killed.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I understand. But this level of surveillance comes with a lot of red tape. I'll cut through it. In the meantime, I need you on something else. A charter plane crashed in New Jersey this morning, killing everyone on board. Apparently it also killed their counterparts on the other side.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How is that possible?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I don't know. But I want you to report to The Bridge and pick up members from the other Fringe Division. We'll be investigating this together.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yes, sir.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Agent Dunham, are you ready?\nOLIVIA: Uh, almost.\nWALTER: Always like to empty my bladder before a long trip.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you do realize that we're just walking through a door.\nWALTER: It's better safe than sorry.\nOLIVIA: We're ready Sergeant.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Doctor Walter Bishop?\nWALTER: Yes, that's me. Walter Bishop, Consultant.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Place your hand on the screen, please. Do you have a pacemaker?\nWALTER: No.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Have you ever been diagnosed with smallpox?\nWALTER: No.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Tuberculosis?\nWALTER: No.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Malaria?\nWALTER: No.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Are you on any medications?\nWALTER: Several. Mostly recreational.\nOLIVIA: It's okay.\nSECURITY SCREENER: Per Treaty Code 5891J, once you cross over, you will be subject to the same laws and regulations as any naturalized citizen of the other side. Do you understand?\nWALTER: I do.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Initiating scan. Scan complete.\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you sure that you don't want me to go with you?\nWALTER: I'm sure, Dear. Once Peter receives the bodies at the lab, he'll need your help to examine them. And when I've collected samples from the bodies on the other side, I'll return and we can compare the two. Besides, I'm sure you love birds could use a little time together.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: And thank you for trusting me. This is a really big step for me. Ah, my escort is here. And by 'escort', I don't mean 'prostitute'.\nOLIVIA: Good to see you.\nAGENT LEE: You too.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Shall we?\nOLIVIA: How is she doing?\nAGENT LEE: As well as can be expected considering she just lost her partner. She wants to find the people responsible.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I hope she does. She's lucky to have your help, Lincoln. Take care of Walter.\nAGENT LEE: I will.\nSERGEANT WHEELER: Agent Dunham.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Sergeant. These two are with me.\nWALTER: What is this?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's a list of hot spots where the damage was the worst.\nWALTER: I see.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's getting better, though. The Bridge is helping to heal our world.\nSERGEANT WHEELER: You're all set.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you.\nSERGEANT WHEELER: Oh, Agent Dunham, sorry to hear about Agent Lee. He was a good man.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you.\nWALTER: I wanted to bring a casserole.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Casserole?\nWALTER: Well, in times of grief, people need to eat. But apparently it's forbidden to transport perishables between universes.\nAGENT LEE: Doctor Bishop, do you have a theory as to how a plane crash in one universe can kill people in the other?\nWALTER: No, not yet. In all our years of researching the relationship between the universes, Belly and I were successfully able to transport matter from one side to the other. Even to merge tiny portions of both universes, but it never occurred to us that an event that happened in one universe would cause a reaction on the other.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: But do you think that someone could have caused this?\nWALTER: On purpose? Anything's possible, even Santa Claus.\nAGENT LEE: Why? You don't think Jones had something to do with this, do you?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's just Nina Sharp said that things were about to get a lot worse, and then about an hour later, this happened.\nWALTER: It's possible. But if Jones caused this, he's conceived of something Belly and I never did.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What are you looking for?\nWALTER: Not looking. Listening. You hear that? It's a perfect \"G\".\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: A hand.\nWALTER: I removed it from one of the victims on our side.\nAGENT LEE: You couldn't bring over a casserole, but a severed hand is okay?\nWALTER: Shh. That's a \"G\". That's incorrect. It should be a \"C\". You see, each universe vibrates at its own specific frequencies. Everything from this universe would vibrate at a \"G\", and everything from our universe at \"C\". Somehow the victims on our side were made to vibrate at the frequency of this universe.\nAGENT LEE: So you're saying that the doppelgangers were somehow linked across universes?\nWALTER: Yes, it would seem so.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: How? How were the bodies retuned?\nWALTER: That's a good question.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well, do you think maybe that's what killed them?\nWALTER: That's another good question, but I don't think so. I suggest it was the plane crash that killed them, not the retuning, as you call it. But it stands to reason that somehow the events were linked.\nAGENT LEE: Have you recovered the black box yet?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: What's a black box?\nAGENT LEE: From the plane. The cockpit recorder.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: We don't have that. But satellites record all communication in flight.\nIDLEWILD DEPARTURE: Two-Eight-Niner, Departure Radar has you at 8,000 feet. Maintain a heading of 2-2-0.\nAIRCRAFT COMMANDER: Idlewild Control, we appear to be running into some turbulence. Request permission to climb another - -\nPASSENGER: What the hell was that?\nIDLEWILD DEPARTURE: Say again, Two-Eight-Niner?\nAIRCRAFT COMMANDER: ATC, aircraft is coming apart. Systems failing! Vertical control is -- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! The wing!\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Would you like for me to play that again?\nAGENT LEE: No. That won't be necessary.\nWALTER: If my hypothesis is correct, whatever merged the frequencies of the two universes destabilized the aircraft. Whoever's responsible must have attached some sort of device to the craft.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, well, what if you're right? I mean, why? Doesn't feel like an assassination. So what, is it a threat? What are they trying to prove?\nWALTER: I haven't the slightest.\nJONES' OPERATIVE: Sorry that I'm late.\nDAVID JONES: No matter. Gave me time to enjoy my tea. I must say, Matcha is one of the few things I'm going to miss. How did our experiment with the plane go?\nJONES' OPERATIVE: Better than we expected. Do you have a preference for this next one?\nDAVID JONES: Surprise me.\nDIANE BROYLES: Hey, you.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Hey.\nDIANE BROYLES: How was the service?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: It was difficult.\nDIANE BROYLES: I'm so sorry.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: It's fine. How's Chris?\nDIANE BROYLES: He's good. Can't stop talking about some girl in his class. If only I could get him to pay half as much attention to his homework as he does to those girls.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Where is he?\nDIANE BROYLES: He's in the living room. We've been entertaining your friend.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: What friend?\nCHRIS BROYLES: Oh, hey Dad.\nDAVID JONES: Hello Philip. I'm just catching up with Christopher here. He really is a remarkable young man. It's a pleasure to finally meet him.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: We have protocols for making contact. Showing up in my home isn't one of them.\nDAVID JONES: I see where my showing up unannounced would be worrying. But I wanted to bring this to you - - personally. I understand it's a tad overdue. Christopher's responding extraordinarily well to treatment. It's hard to imagine that a few months ago he was in constant pain, His eyesight was gone, that he was --\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Dying.\nDAVID JONES: Every parent's nightmare.\nDIANE BROYLES: Christopher, come help me in the kitchen!\nDAVID JONES: I certainly don't envy what you've been through. I noticed the way your wife looks at him. It's as if she's witnessing a miracle.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: But there aren't miracles. That's what you're here to remind me about. Right?\nDAVID JONES: I'm sure you were dismayed after the unfortunate incident with Agent Lee.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I buried an agent today. A good man. And I\u2019m also well aware that Agent Lee isn't the first casualty of our... collaboration. Some day I\u2019ll have to account for what I\u2019ve done, but...\nDAVID JONES: But you can't lose your boy. Love makes us vulnerable. But it also makes us human, I suppose.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Is there anything else?\nDAVID JONES: No. Not yet. But I will be calling on you very shortly.\nJONES' OPERATIVE: Right here's fine.\nNANCY GUERRING: I'm going to Liberty Heights. What's that?\nCLERK: Did you find everything you were looking for?\nNANCY GUERRING (alt): Mm-hmm.\nCLERK: That'll be $18.47.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, we're here.\nPETER: According to the cops, the cab went over the bridge at exactly 6:37, the same time the victim died on the other side.\nASTRID: Hello. My team's online. We're just standing by.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I'm ready whenever they are.\nASTRID: It's nice to see you again.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes.\nASTRID: Um... I brought you something. Oh, no, no, it's okay. I got permission. You like it?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I never thought that I was going to taste this again. Oh, here they are. Hello.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Can you tell Agent Dunham that our victim's name is Nancy Guerring. According to her Show Me, she's from Malden, Massachusetts. Hey, there you are.\nWALTER: Domesticated badgers, really? As pets?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Come on, Walter. We need you.\nASTRID: Olivia, their victim's name is Nancy Guerring.\nOLIVIA: Same here. Nancy Elizabeth Guerring.\nWALTER: Ask if her left arm is broken.\nASTRID: Is her left arm broken?\nOLIVIA: Yep.\nPETER: Hey, Astrid, can you ask Walter what it is I\u2019m looking for? What this device might look like?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Doctor Bishop says that a device this powerful is probably rather large.\nASTRID: Uh, Peter, Walter says the device could be rather large.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Or it might be small.\nASTRID: Actually, I don't think he has any idea what it looks like.\nPETER: I got something.\nOLIVIA: Hold on. We found something. What is it?\nPETER: Amphilicite.\nOLIVIA: Jones.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Have we found a similar device at the crash site?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, but considering the wreckage, it could have been destroyed.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Doctor Bishop, do you have any idea what Jones is trying to do?\nWALTER: He's done it twice, originating once in each universe.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: So why? He must have a reason.\nWALTER: Of course he has a reason. Problem is I don't know what it is. I'm sorry.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: It's been a long day. Maybe after a good night's sleep.\nWALTER: I think you're right. Although the pillow I was given last night left me with a terrible crick. Apparently this universe hasn't discovered memory foam.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, Walter, you can stay at my place tonight if you like. I got a spare room.\nWALTER: I appreciate that. Thank you. And I shall refrain from sleeping naked.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Well that is good to know. Okay, I\u2019m gonna get my bag.\nWALTER: Colonel Broyles. I wanted to apologize.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: For what?\nWALTER: For snapping at you. It's not you I\u2019m angry with. None of what Jones is doing would be possible without the right conditions. I created those conditions by crossing over all those years ago. Had I not done that, we wouldn't be in this situation now.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Doctor Bishop. May I ask you something?\nWALTER: Of course.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: If you had to do it all over again, would you make the same choice?\nWALTER: If you'd asked me that question a few months ago, the answer would have been no. But now that I have met my adult son, got to know him, I don't know that I'd do anything differently.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Agent Dunham, I ran the names, all their cell records, electronic communication --\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm sorry, what?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: The list of 108 names that you gave to Colonel Broyles. He got clearance and asked me to look into them.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Did you find anything?\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: I ran the data twice. There is nothing to implicate any of them. Nothing at all out of the ordinary. Do you want me to run the information for a third time?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, it's okay. Thank you.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You wanna tell me what this is?\nDAVID JONES: No. All you need to know is what you're to do with it. Take it to Liberty Island, to what I believe you call The Bridge, and affix it to the control panel on the machine.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: You do realize that machine is healing our worlds?\nDAVID JONES: I do. Need I remind you who I am healing? No hurry. Anytime before sundown tomorrow should be fine.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: So your mother tells me you have some good news.\nCHRIS BROYLES: I told her not to say anything.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: She didn't. That's all she said. I'm waiting to hear it from you, so spill it.\nCHRIS BROYLES: Okay. So today at recess a bunch of the guys were playing hitball. And when they started picking the teams, I got picked first.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: That's great.\nCHRIS BROYLES: No Dad, you don't understand. I got picked first, me.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: So who won the game?\nCHRIS BROYLES: We did.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Now that's good news.\nCHRIS BROYLES: It gets better.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Really?\nCHRIS BROYLES: Yeah, so Stacy, this girl in my class, told Danny that she likes me. Can you believe that? Dad, no one's ever liked me.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'm glad you had a good day. Good night, Chris.\nCHRIS BROYLES: Good night, Dad.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Can't you sleep? Is the bed too hard?\nWALTER: No, I was sleeping like a baby. Sadly my bladder was not. You're a lot like her, you know? The other Olivia. She has trouble sleeping too when there's an open case.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: It's not the case. It's the evidence from Lincoln's murder.\nWALTER: I see. Are you looking for something in particular?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: A mole. The night that he died, we were transporting a prisoner, and someone must have let Jones's men know the location of our convoy. And then he sent his people into ambush us. I'm sorry, I don't usually drink, and my ex, Frank, he left this here when he moved out.\nWALTER: Are these the rest of Frank's belongings?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That's everything that Lincoln had left in Fringe Division. And I\u2019m supposed to give it to his parents, And I just can't face them, not until I got something more to tell them. And I thought this would give me some courage, but all it's done is just make me feel a little bit sick.\nWALTER: Well I have just the thing for that. Some people swear by hair of the dog, but I prefer nature's sponge, the egg. It won't be long.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I'm missing something. I know I am, Walter.\nWALTER: Then I suggest you sleep on it. Our brains are remarkable instruments. They can process evidence even when we're not conscious.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Yeah, but that's the thing, there is no evidence. I mean, there is absolutely nothing linking any of the likely suspects to the crime.\nWALTER: Then perhaps it's time to give some thought to the dog that did not bark.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I don't understand.\nWALTER: Sherlock Holmes. Fictitious detective. Penchant for cocaine?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No, not on this side.\nWALTER: The point is no evidence is evidence in and of itself.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay. So what if our mole is covering his tracks? Then it would have to be someone pretty high up on the food chain. I mean, someone with enough clearance to alter classified details.\nWALTER: How about Colonel Broyles?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: No. Broyles? No way.\nWALTER: You know him better than I do. But in the case of a mole, no one should be above suspicion. Frankly, I\u2019m still upset about Nixon.\nNINA SHARP: I don't suppose you brought me my breakfast. Is there a reason for the additional privacy?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I just wanted to tell you in person that we found our mole. We have Colonel Broyles in custody. He told us everything, so he won't be able to set you free anymore.\nNINA SHARP: You really have no idea. Philip is irrelevant. He's just another pawn. This changes nothing, Agent Dunham. I know Jones, And he will come for me.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Perhaps. Unless you're just another pawn.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: She just confirmed it's Broyles.\nAGENT LEE: For all we know, Nina Sharp is lying.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Why would she lie to me? What does she have to gain?\nAGENT LEE: Maybe she knew you were bluffing.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Agents, I\u2019ve been asking around. No one has seen Colonel Broyles come in today. I checked, and his subcutaneous tracker was disabled two hours ago. Should we be worried?\nBRIDGE SENTRY: Good morning, Sir. Your Show Me, please. Thank you. How you doing today?\nCOLONEL BROYLES: Fine, thanks.\nBRIDGE SENTRY: Sir... you are good to go.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, well, thank you, Diane. I'm really sorry to have bothered you at home. Bye.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Colonel Broyles's 'Show Me' was just swiped at Liberty Island.\nAGENT LEE: What's he doing there?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: The Bridge is there. The Secretary of Defense. He could be doing any number of things. Come on.\nBRIDGE SENTRY: Agent Dunham.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Did Colonel Broyles come through here?\nBRIDGE SENTRY: Yeah, about ten minutes ago. Hey, you haven't been cleared!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Come on.\nBROYLES: I got your message. Colonel Broyles just turned himself in. He told us everything.\nCOLONEL BROYLES: I'm sorry.\nWALTER: Well Dear, I guess this is it.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you for everything.\nWALTER: Don't judge him. No one can be certain exactly what they're capable of, how far they'll go to save the ones they love. I know this more than most. Keep an eye on this universe, will you? I've grown quite fond of it.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: See, I\u2019m surprised that you're not going back with him.\nAGENT LEE: I told you I'd help find the people who killed your partner. And mine. And until we do that, I'm not going anywhere. Look, it might not feel like it now, but it does get better.\nPETER: Walter, what's up? We got here as quick as we could.\nWALTER: I know why he did it twice. Jones, I think I know what he's doing.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWALTER: It was a test. The damage we saw was irrelevant. He was just taking readings.\nOLIVIA: Well, what kind of readings?\nWALTER: He wanted to find a common denominator, a frequency that could link both universes.\nPETER: Right, so that whatever he did over there, the same thing would happen over here. We already know that, Walter.\nWALTER: No. That was just a start. Had Colonel Broyles uploaded this device into the machine, it would make it possible for Jones to do something much worse.\nOLIVIA: Like what?\nWALTER: He could collapse both universes."

(greets the familiar face and allows her through the gated entrance)\n(the agent wanders through austere interior of the modernistic club and checks the faces of the bald male guests and their assorted friends)\nRICK: (to an Observer after he man-handles one of his 'employees') Excuse me. She's got next shift. You guys keep taking my girls, you're gonna put me out of business.\nNEO-OBSERVER: Get a new girl. (throws Kitty to the couch. provokes a punch in the gut from Rick)\n(Rick is restrained by uniformed Loyalists and a senior Observer steps-in to flex his authority)\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You seem to be quite... agitated. (only to receive a face full of spit from Rick. displeased at the overt defiance, Windmark focuses his telekinetic powers on Rick's cranium. as blood trickles from Rick's ears, the young Fringe agent knocks Rick to the ground, ending the telepathic assault) What are you doing, Agent?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (matter-of-factly) He's a native. My jurisdiction. Sorry he acted out, Captain Windmark. I mean, you could Wipe Him, sure, but then there's the inquiry, the paperwork. Club gets shut for two days, and I, for one, lose a hell of a lot of kickbacks.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: (attempts to read her thoughts as she rambles) I must say, Agent, you are always exactly what you seem.\n(outside the club, Bishop escorts her two associates from harms-way)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (to Rick) Can you stand? (to Kitty) Go home, Kitty. Take the rest of the night off.\nKITTY: Thanks, Rick.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (to Rick after they are alone) What are you? Stupid?\nRICK: (still in pain) What can I say? I'm a gentleman. I had to piss him off so he'd try and Wipe Me. Otherwise he would have Read Me. But he Read You. And you fooled him. How the Hell did you do that?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Just lucky, I guess.\nRICK: Lucky? They find out about you, they'll kill you. Hell, they find out there's anyone like you, they'll probably kill us all.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I love being 'Special'.\nRICK: (as they make their way back to his parked van) You're late. I said 6:00. It's 8:00.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: They added two new checkpoints Downtown. You said important.\nRICK: Oh, baby... you don't know the half of it. Remember all those times I said you were nuts? (opens the rear doors to the van) Looks like I was wrong. Go ahead.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Does anyone else know about this? (hops inside to check the cargo)\nRICK: No, of course not.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (uncovers the contents) Oh, my God. (touches her necklace) Where are the others? Were they ...\nRICK: ...yeah. Two more. Man and a woman. Younger. Right where I found this one. Heat was rising. Couldn't move 'em all at once.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Where?\nRICK: The city. Inside the old -- (a gunshot sounds and Rick's blood splatters the agent's face. the assassin runs down a sidestreet to avoid capture. eager to clear the scene, Agent Bishop grabs Rick's vehicle keys, closes the rear doors and races from the area)\nCITYWIDE BROADCAST: Attention. Curfew is now in effect. 'Natives', please return to your homes immediately.\n(clear of the area and still covered in Rick's blood, Henrietta Bishop parks the van and rechecks the precious cargo he delivered... the Amber encased body of Doctor Walter Bishop)\nSIMON FOSTER: (to subordinate agents gathered in the Situation Room) Loyalists hung a few resistance fighters from Copley Plaza Mall. We need to cut them down. We have two containment breaches in Back Bay. And curfews -- people are getting brave. Don't let them. (to Henrietta when she approaches) Where the Hell have you been, Agent?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Sir, I need \u2013\nSIMON FOSTER: (curt) Walk with me. Now. (heads for the elevator lobby) Late.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I know.\nSIMON FOSTER: Very.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Sorry... very. I need a coffee.\nSIMON FOSTER: I could use some air myself. (in a covered breezeway between buildings. downs a coffee chew tablet) I remember when you used to be able to drink this stuff.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (smart-alecky) You are old.\nSIMON FOSTER: So what's wrong?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Rick's dead.\nSIMON FOSTER: What?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Loyalist killed him.\nSIMON FOSTER: Damn it, 'Etta. Black market tech gets people killed. Even cops.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Black market tech replaced your eyes.\nSIMON FOSTER: I don't need a history lesson. You were gonna stop running civilians.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I had an open order with him. From the old days. I just never cancelled it.\nSIMON FOSTER: An order for what?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Any info on the missing team.\nSIMON FOSTER: (disappointed with her persistence) Really? Again? You've got to let this go.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Simon --\nSIMON FOSTER: It's a myth, 'Etta. The original Fringe team didn't vanish. They aren't missing. They died twenty years ago. They aren't coming back to save us from the Observers. They aren't in a desert or, Peru, or immortal.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You're right. They're in Amber. And I've got one of them right here.\nSIMON FOSTER: (standing in awe in front of the ambered nonagenerian) Well, I'll be a toe... on a foot... in a grave.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (looking at the tech device in Walter's hands) That's the Amber device. He did this on purpose.\nSIMON FOSTER: What could have been so terrible that he Ambered himself?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: And his team. Rick said the others were with him. Once we get Doctor Bishop out, he can tell us where they are.\nSIMON FOSTER: Let's not get ahead of ourselves yet.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Agent. (slowly strolls in, removes his hat and invites himself to sit)\nBROYLES: (refusing a sip from a flask) No, thank you.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Don't be rude, Phillip. Have a drink with me.\nBROYLES: It's water. It doesn't do anything for me.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: It hydrates you.\nBROYLES: Yes, I suppose it does.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: (places a small holographic imager on the desk and runs a playback recording) As much as I would have enjoyed eliminating him myself, native-on-native killing cannot stand. Not on my watch.\nBROYLES: I heard. And, no, we don't have any leads.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: This is the fourth this month.\nBROYLES: I can count.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: (softly. earnest) I like you, Phillip. But be assured... bite my hand and I will put you down. Your Division is in charge of Native crime. (menacing) Or would you rather I was in charge of native crime? I don't think you'd like my methods.\nBROYLES: (barely tolerant) I'll get you a suspect.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Good. (stands and dons his hat to leave)\nBROYLES: Windmark. What did you do up there in the future... to get yourself such a 'crap detail'?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: (amused at the interest) I like animals.\nSIMON FOSTER: Third generation Amber. No reverse protocols. Durable stuff, this.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: There's no way to revert it to its gaseous form?\nSIMON FOSTER: I didn't say that. (turns for a brief test on his bench equipment) Oh, dear.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (jokes when he turns back around with an index finger covered in solidified Amber) It's a good look on you.\nSIMON FOSTER: It looks like the Amber can only be reverted to its gaseous state momentarily. He won't have enough time to emerge safely. By the time he's aware enough to step out of it... the gas will have resolidified, capturing him again.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Couldn't we just push him out?\nSIMON FOSTER: Not unless you want to end up encased in that stuff yourself.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Hey.\nCLERK: Hey. (looks at the document she hands him) What is it for?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Hell if I know. You know Simon.\nCLERK: You know... not everyone trusts Simon. My friends \u2014\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Your friends in 'the city'?\nCLERK: Some think he's allowed the resistance to operate a little... too freely. He had better have a good reason for checking out old Level-Two tech. 'Cause my friends...\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (unimpressed with his name dropping) ...in the city?\nCLERK: They're gonna be watching. A girl like you might want to watch her \"P\"s and \"Q\"s. Wouldn't want to do the wrong thing.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I'll keep that in mind. (departs with a small carry-all)\nSIMON FOSTER: Fire in the hole! (activates the handheld device that was signed out of impound - blasting everything on the table off onto the floor)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Wow.\nSIMON FOSTER: Crowd control -- back before the Loyalists decided it was easier just to use bullets. (adds some buffers to the base of Walter's Amber coffin) I'm quite proud of these little beauties. (stands back with the control trigger) When I say.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (smartly) Really? I was gonna go before. (sarcastic)\nSIMON FOSTER: Okay, buffers are communicating. Ready? Three, two, one. (as she prematurely blast Walter from the Amber and throws him to the far wall) I didn't say \u2018now\u2019.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You were late!\nSIMON FOSTER: (injects a wrist) Doctor Bishop, my name is Agent Simon Foster. It is a great honor for me to meet you, sir.\nWALTER: (slowly gaining his senses) And you, young lady, you're very pretty.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: \u2018Etta. We just removed you from Amber, Doctor Bishop. You were inside twenty years.\nWALTER: Twenty years? It's no wonder I'm so hungry. Do you have anything to eat?\nSIMON FOSTER: This was -- is your favorite food. That's what they say. The stories, I mean.\nWALTER: Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! (munches his cherished red licorice) That's lovely, thank you.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Our records indicate that, after the invasion, you and your team discovered a way of getting rid of the Observers. (activates a small holographic imager on the table in front of Walter) These are the blueprints for the device you were working on. But we believe, before you could finish it, you and your team were -- were you all caught in Amber?\nWALTER: What do you call it?\nSIMON FOSTER: We don't know. We -- we thought it was some kind of Beacon.\nWALTER: No, no, no, you 'Silly-Billy' ...this.\nSIMON FOSTER: The same as you. we call it licorice.\nWALTER: Licorice. Licorice. Li-cor-ice. Who are you? You're quite pretty. Li-cor-ice. Do you have 'Ring-Dings' \u00a9? (seemingly not as coherent as his rescuers would have liked him to be)\nSIMON FOSTER: (later. after corralling Walter onto an examination table for a brain scan) Doctor Bishop, I need you to try and stay perfectly still. Walter.\nWALTER: Yes, I hear you, Peter. I will try not to move.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Here, try this. (hands Simon a heavy-duty fuse to gap the circuit in the large hospital-style scanner)\nSIMON FOSTER: His neuropathways have degraded. (studying the scanned skull of Walter) It looks as if he's experienced some sort of trauma. Probably because he was so close to the blast horizon of the Amber.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Brain damage.\nSIMON FOSTER: Mmm.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Well, how do we fix him?\nSIMON FOSTER: I don't know.\nWAITING OBSERVER: (sitting in the lobby) She'll be here in a moment. Your meeting. It's about to take place. (stands and leaves)\nNINA: (rolls forward in her wheelchair) You wanted to see me, Agent.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Yes, ma'am. We're still waiting on the touch screens for Headquarters. They've been back-ordered now for six months.\nNINA: Well, I don't know how to break this to you, Agent, but your Department's needs are the lowest thing on my list of priorities.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I understand that it's...\nNINA: ...or perhaps even lower. And how is it that you always manage to come during my lunch hour? Walk me to my car.\nNINA: (as they gather away from the building) I'm sorry. I can't hide my thoughts from them the same way that you can. Have you made any progress with Walter's device?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Well, yes and no.\nNINA: (turns and sees her decades old colleague) And the others. Are they..?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: ...unclear. If Doctor Bishop knows where they are, he's unable to tell us.\nNINA: And why not?\nWALTER: (after she approaches) Do I know you?\nNINA: Yes, Walter. It's Nina. Nina Sharp. We've known each other for many years. It's good to see you again.\nWALTER: (smiles heartily) In that case, it's good to see you too. (attention wanders to the riverside)\nSIMON FOSTER: So what do you think, Ms Sharp? Can you help fix him?\nNINA: Of course, you understand the risks - - of wanting to save the world?\nSIMON FOSTER: Well, they say he did it once before.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: He and his team.\nNINA: Yes, they did. But not without great consequence. I can't fix him. (as Walter begins to play at the nearby railing) But I have an idea. Massive Dynamic has long had a piece of Walter's brain that was surgically removed and kept in a locked vault. It's entirely possible that you could use that material to inspire Walter's brain to heal itself.\nSIMON FOSTER: They removed a piece of his brain?\nNINA: William Bell did. (matter-of-factly) It was at Walter's request.\nSIMON FOSTER: Why?\nNINA: I don't think he liked the person he was becoming.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: So can you go get it and bring it out here?\nNINA: Well, no, it's not as simple as that. The old brain tissue is very fragile. Neural matter can decay in seconds. You can't just carry it around in a Petri dish.\nSIMON FOSTER: (pensive) Why do I feel... like you're trying to bury the lead?\nNINA: The material isn't here. It's still at our old facility. In the city.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: That's 'wall-to-wall' Observers.\nSIMON FOSTER: We've done harder.\nWALTER: (fiddling with her roboarm) You really should get this fixed.\nNINA: (on phone) Hmm. Alright, Simon. (to Walter about the annoyance) Walter, stop it. (back on the phone) Uh, no, we've just been catching up. (listens) Yes. No, he'll be ready when you get here. (hangs-up) Walter. 'Etta and Simon got the transit passes. What on Earth are you doing?\nWALTER: Try it. (her repaired arm)\nNINA: Wha--? Oh. (delighted with his tweak)\nWALTER: I do hope we're going to the Circus.\nNINA: Heh. Walter.\nPUBLIC ADDRESS: Observers may proceed to Platform Six through Twenty-six for service.\n(with Walter in-tow, the trio enters the busy train station in an attempt to gain access to Manhattan proper)\nWALTER: Snacks. (scanning the many vending kiosks) Do you think they'd have any of that delicious lic -- (an Observer turns from the kiosk directly in front of him. angered) Monsters!\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Shh. (hoping to avoid drawing the attention and ire of the enforcer) It's okay.\nWALTER: (loudly) Monster!\nSIMON FOSTER: (softly. in damage control mode) We got to get him off the street.\nLOYALIST OFFICER: (a man in a authoritarian uniform with a tattoo ID on his face approaches) Hold up there. What seems to be the matter?\nSIMON FOSTER: (cordial) Fringe Agents. No matter. We're just heading Downtown.\nLOYALIST OFFICER: I see. I trust you have papers.\nSIMON FOSTER: Of course. (hands-over the documentation)\nLOYALIST OFFICER: (to Walter) What's your name, Prisoner?\nWALTER: (irate) Prisoner? I most certainly am not. Look at me! Do I look like --?\nSIMON FOSTER: (conciliatory) He's -- he's not a prisoner. He's her grandfather.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We're taking him to visit my grandmother's grave. Today's the anniversary of her death.\nWALTER: \"I am not a number. I am a free man.\" (loudly. then chuckles)\nSIMON FOSTER: (laughing along with the wackiness) As you can see, he's crazy. (whispering. looking for some slack) We just checked him out of the home for the day. But it was last minute, and we didn't have time to do the proper paperwork.\nWALTER: (monotone. selling the crazy) 'These aren't the 'droids you're looking for.'\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Heh, I'm sorry. I'm sure you can understand.\nLOYALIST OFFICER: (studies Walter's face. sees the crazy) Next time, I won't be so nice.\nSIMON FOSTER: (smiles kindly and gets his papers) Thank you.\nWALTER: (mocking) Move along.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (once alone. relieved at their success) Nice.\n(as trains pass into and out of the city, they cross a barren Central Park - now a huge air pollution generator)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (to Walter as Simon enters Nina's security code for a loading dock access door at the unoccupied former Headquarters of Massive Dynamic) You okay?\nWALTER: (exhilarated) Yes. Wonderful. It's quite the adventure, isn't it?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Yeah, I suppose it is.\nWALTER: Like 'The Guns of Navarone'. (Simon gains access and the trio enters and investigates the abandoned parking structure)\nWALTER: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What?\nWALTER: I feel like I've been here before.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You have. Many times, I imagine. Though that was a long time ago.\nWALTER: I hope it was cleaner then. This dust is revolting.\n(wary of the surroundings, no one manages to notice the laser trip wire for the security system as they step through it)\nAGENT ROMICK: (sitting in the Situation Room at Fringe Division, the breach alert catches his attention and he heads to the bosses office) Sir, there's been a break-in at the old Massive Dynamic.\nBROYLES: Massive Dynamic?\nAGENT ROMICK: Yes, sir. Underground parking garage.\nBROYLES: Are we sure it isn't a fault in the system? It's been buggy lately.\nAGENT ROMICK: I ran diagnostics. It's not a false alarm.\nBROYLES: (speed dials his phone) This is Agent Broyles. I need to talk to Captain Windmark.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (after Simon retrieves the missing brain pieces from a cryo-vault) How's it look?\nSIMON FOSTER: I can't say. I have no idea how it's supposed to look.\nWALTER: What is that? Monkey feces?\nSIMON FOSTER: That, Doctor Bishop, is your brain. (to Henrietta) We need an inactive medium to transfer the neural tissue. A mixture of saline and polysorbate 80. Three CCs of each.\nWALTER: Have you seen it?\nSIMON FOSTER: Monkey feces? No. I can't say I've had the pleasure.\nWALTER: I wouldn't say that it was a pleasure.\nSIMON FOSTER: First, I need you to take these pills. They're Diazepam, mostly. They'll put you into a deep sleep, for ten minutes, that will quiet your brain to allow the process to occur faster.\nWALTER: You're a clever boy.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Dare I ask?\nSIMON FOSTER: Synthetic neurotrophins. Growth proteins. If this process works, it should allow his brain to absorb the missing tissue in a matter of minutes.\nWALTER: I've eaten it once. It was sweeter than you'd think.\nSIMON FOSTER: Feces?\nWALTER: God, no. Brain. And LSD. I love LSD.\nSIMON FOSTER: Okay. Ready. Doctor Bishop, we're going to inject that solution into the base of your brain.\nWALTER: Oh, fun. What was your name, again?\nSIMON FOSTER: Simon.\nWALTER: Simon. Like in the game 'Simon Says'. I'm going to have to listen to you. Isn't that right, young lady?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Yes, he's a very smart boy.\nSIMON FOSTER: Okay, this may look scary, but--\nWALTER: I suddenly feel very tired, Simon.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Here.\nWALTER: Simon says, 'Go to sleep now, Walter'.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (later, as Walter sleeps in an examination chair) What if this doesn't work? Doctor Bishop?\nSIMON FOSTER: It has to. (reflective) When I was in my freshman year at college -- I'm at Stanford. And in the middle of the night, my roommate comes banging on my door. Tells me to wake up, come check out the TV. I tell him to go away. I... I have a girl in my bed. But he won't take no for an answer. So me and the girl... Emily... We get dressed, go to the common room. On the TV they're showing footage from... Chicago, L.A... London. Observers going from house to house and... dragging people out into the street.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: That was 2015. The Purge.\nSIMON FOSTER: I'm watching people... being dragged from their homes, led into the street, and being... put down like dogs. And suddenly... I knew. I don't know how, but... I knew. That's... why my parents sent me so far away for school. They were part of the resistance. They -- they sent me away to protect me. That was the night they were killed. And that was the night... I knew I wouldn't give up... until the Observers had gone.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You never told me that.\nSIMON FOSTER: I never told anyone that.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I was only four the last time I saw my parents. I can't even picture their faces anymore. (fondles her necklace in memory. Walter stirs from his rest) Doctor Bishop? Are you okay?\nWALTER: (full functional with his restored brain matter) I believe that's mine, young man.\nSIMON FOSTER: (hands over Walter's device) Agent Simon Foster. Fringe Division. Pleased to meet you, Sir.\nWALTER: What year is it?\nSIMON FOSTER: 2036.\nWALTER: And they're still here? The Observers?\n(Loyalist enforcers fan-out through the Massive Dynamic parking garage where the security tripwire was activated)\nNEO-OBSERVER: Assessment?\nLOYALIST OFFICER: Sir, I count three sets of footprints.\nNEO-OBSERVER: Ready weapons.\nLOYALIST OFFICER: Protocol?\nNEO-OBSERVER: Shoot first. I'll read them later. (the assault squad heads for the interior laboratories)\nTACTICAL RADIO: Sir, 12th Floor is clear.\nNEO-OBSERVER: Okay, proceed to the 13th.\nSIMON FOSTER: Can you build it?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter?\nWALTER: (remembering The Purge) They weren't all bad, you know. One of them even tried to help us. He was called September. What happened to him was... well, unexpected. He told me that, in the year 2609 A.D., they finally ruined the planet. (turns of the holographic device he was studying) They poisoned it -- the air, the water. And when it was fundamentally uninhabitable, then they traveled back through time, and took our planet from us. (resolves) Yes, I can build it.\nSIMON FOSTER: Okay, good.\nWALTER: It'll take some time.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: But it would be easier if you didn't have to do it alone. Wouldn't it? If you had your team with you to help you? You were trapped in Amber with them, right? Do you remember where that was? Do you remember where we can find the others?\nWALTER: (looks at her face closely. a spark of recognition) You.\nSIMON FOSTER: (as the lobby bell dings) Elevator.\nWALTER: Did you forget to disable the internal alarms? (angered) What are you people? Idiots? This way. (walks the opposite wall and opens a door to a secret passage) Neither Belly or I ever left ourselves only one way out of a room. Come on.\nLOYALIST OFFICER: (enters the cryovault and places his hand on the examination chair) Warm. They were just here. So how'd they get out?\nNEO-OBSERVER: Step back. (aims his pistol at the wall with the secret passage)\nWALTER: (racing through the sterile hallways with the others. stumbles) Keep going! Two lefts, then a right. (takes a quick turn away from the Fringe agents)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (at the exit door) How do we open it? (sees her concerned partners face) What?\nSIMON FOSTER: (notices that Walter has slipped away) Where's Bishop? (races to locate the 90 y\/o scientist as the assault forces march closer)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (finds him in a crowded backlab) Walter, come on. We've got to get out of here. They're coming.\nWALTER: (to Simon) Give me your watch.\nSIMON FOSTER: What?\nWALTER: Your watch. Now.\nSIMON FOSTER: What are you doing? What is this?\nWALTER: Resistance must take place at any opportunity. We are insurgents. And this is anti-matter. (places a large glowing canister in a bench instrument) You're smart -- you do the math. (leaving. now!) What are you waiting for? Come on!\nLOYALIST OFFICER: (as the trio clears the building through the service entrance they came in earlier) Sir, in here. (the assault team enters the sidelab vacated by Walter just a minute earlier. the bald man in the Fedora steps close to the device that Walter filled with anti-matter. he suddenly realizes what he is standing next to and begins to gasp)\n(outside in the public plaza. the insurgents join the general foot traffic and try to fit-in after their successful evasion)\nWALTER: I know where they are.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Who?\nWALTER: The others. My team. I know where we were Ambered. (the anti-matter device activates and the building formerly known as Massive Dynamic erases itself from the skyline a few hundred feet away) We should hurry. It's not far from here.\n(in an old storage area filled with archaic office equipment and an ancient typewriter, the duo waits for Walter in front of the Ambered team he left decades earlier)\nSIMON FOSTER: So... are you gonna tell me what that was all about? Back at Massive Dynamic. You and Bishop.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You see him. He's half a fruitcake short of Christmas.\nSIMON FOSTER: Yeah. Yeah, he is. Isn't he?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: The wand should be just about powered up. I'll check on it.\nBROYLES: And you're certain it was Agent Foster?\nLOYALIST OFFICER: (reporting on his encounter at the transit station) Yes, Agent Foster and a woman, and a man Foster claimed was her grandfather.\nBROYLES: But with a prisoner transport I.D.\nLOYALIST OFFICER: As I said, you may all play fast and loose up there in Boston, but here, rules and regulations matter. If you prefer, I can certainly take this up with downtown--\nBROYLES: No. I can handle my agents. (after the call. in the Situation Room) Agent Romick, activate Agent Foster's tracker and assemble a team.\nWALTER: (holds up a handmade piece of tech) You designed these yourself?\nSIMON FOSTER: Augmentation buffers. Yeah. One goes on either side, down by her feet.\nWALTER: Not bad.\nSIMON FOSTER: (remotivated) You know... I think you're just what we've been waiting for -- someone to show people that we don't just... have to accept our fate... that we can fight back, that we can use our will and our imagination to make a better world, a better life.\nWALTER: (snarky) In that case, a little more focus and a little less pontificating -- we might have the job done by now.\nSIMON FOSTER: Right. (to Henrietta) Ready? On three. One, two, three. (as Henrietta pushes the trigger on the control head...)\nASTRID: (comes flying out of the Amber into Walter's arms) Ooh.\nSIMON FOSTER: 'Etta, the injection.\nASTRID: (disoriented) Where am I?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You're okay. I'm 'Etta. I'm just going to give you an injection to help you breathe, okay?\nWALTER: (fatherly) Hello, Astro.\nASTRID: Walter.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter, where is--\nSIMON FOSTER: (standing nearby holding his fried circuitry) This is not good.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What?\nSIMON FOSTER: I think I broke the wand.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (later sitting at his workbench) Can you fix it?\nSIMON FOSTER: (soldering and tinkering) I can try. Set up the buffers and I'll see what I can do.\nWALTER: (standing near the Amber encased William Bell. to Astrid after he approaches) Shh. (holds up a laser scalpel from his pocket)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (monitoring the augmentation buffers mounted on the Amber near Peter's legs) It's not green. The activation light -- it's red. No, actually, it's going back and forth. Simon, something's wrong. (reads the remote control head) The buffers are having trouble communicating with each other.\nSIMON FOSTER: That doesn't make any sense. There's -- there's nothing here to interfere with the signal. And no phones, no radio waves...\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (as he looks at his forearm) What is it?\nSIMON FOSTER: My tracker. They must have activated it. (looks at the Ambered Peter) We need to get him out of here.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: But how would they know it's us?\nSIMON FOSTER: I don't know. (sense of urgency) But they know we're here. There must be enough of a signal down here to trigger the Amber.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (excitable) Okay, but even so, the wand is broken. How do we get him out of there?\nSIMON FOSTER: I don't know.\nWALTER: I hear sirens. We have to leave. We have to get him out of there now.\nSIMON FOSTER: Okay, I have an idea. Here, take this. When I say now... trigger the Amber.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: But -- (senses a noble act is about to deprive her of her partner)\nSIMON FOSTER: Three... Two... One. (nervous laugh) We need him.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Simon... (hesitant)\nSIMON FOSTER: Do it.... Now! (as she toggles the trigger)\nTACTICAL COMMANDS: (Fringe Division forces make entry into the Ambered storage area) Sub-level - Go! Three - Take Position. Let's Go. At The Stairs! Two Is Clear\nAGENT ROMICK: (to Broyles, as the men fan out through the multiple archways and chambers) Sir.\n(with his attention called to the Amber, Broyles finds Foster embedded in the golden mass, locked in the pushing position that allowed him to displace the previous tenant. on a nearby shelf, the remains of a red licorice stick suggests to Broyles the likely suspect)\nASTRID: (sounding disappointed) William Bell? You just left him there?\nWALTER: You remember what he did to Olivia. Even you can't be that compassionate.\nASTRID: But we need him, don't we? Well, otherwise, how are we going to get access--\nWALTER: It's okay. (removes the severed hand of Bell from his backpack) We have everything we need.\nPETER: (joins Henrietta as she frets at the back of the train) I'm sorry about your friend. We'll do everything we can to get him back. I promise.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (looks at his face closely and a spark of recognition fills her soul with hope. tentative) Do you... know me?\nPETER: (not making the connection) I don't know how I could. I've been stuck in that Amber for over twenty years, you barely look old enough (steam-rolled as the connection floods in) -- Henrietta?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (tears. huge smile. monster hug) Hi, Dad."

Don't know that you really needed a tie. WALTER: I thought it was appropriate.\nPETER: Well, you look great.\nWALTER: Thank you all for coming. I have asked you here because I believe that I have discovered David Robert Jones' true intentions. I believe that Jones is trying to collapse our universes in order to create a gravitational singularity. As our worlds contract... the force becomes greater and greater, and as matter and energy are compressed to a point, the density is so great hat it has no recourse but to rapidly expand outwards again... creating a Big Bang. Mutual destruction. Our side, and yours.\nOLIVIA: And he would do all this why?\nWALTER: To create another universe. His universe. A world in which the laws of physics and nature are designed and controlled by him.\nBROYLES: But how did you come to this conclusion?\nWALTER: I had a dream.\nBROYLES: A dream?\nWALTER: My subconscious mind was working while my conscious mind was at rest.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Walter... with all respect, maybe it was just a dream.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: If I have learned one thing, it's that anything is possible. And given what we know about Jones' actions so far, what Doctor Bishop suggests should not be overlooked.\nPETER: Okay. So let's assume Walter's right. How would Jones do this?\n(In Sydney, Australia, Sally Clark stops walking to check her map and timer watch. In Beijing, China, a blond man chased by begging little kids navigates himself in a crowded alleyway. He stops to check his map and his timer watch. He climbs up the stair, ignoring the warning sign. In the Himalayas, Nepal, a brunette woman runs through the grassy field, stops to catch her breath and checks her timer watch. In Manhattan, New York, Nick Lane gets out the cab and pays the driver through the passenger's window)\nNICK LANE: Keep the change.\n(Nick Lane continues to walk through busy street, checking his timer watch. Sally Clark looks through her compass. The brunette girl navigates using a similar compass. The blond man reaches his destination in a rooftop, checks his watch and closes his eyes. Nick Lane, Sally Clark and the brunette girl close their eyes too)\nANGERED DRIVER: Get out of the street! ANGERED CABBIE: Move! Let's go! Let's go!\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You lost me, Walter. How could someone destroy two universes and survive to see it?\nPETER: Westfield. Jones used the Amphilicite to destroy the town of Westfield in our universe and in yours. But when he was finished, there was one area is still standing.\nBROYLES: Meaning? WALTER: Meaning perhaps it was a test. A way to ensure his survival.\nAGENT LEE: So Jones is planning on what? Riding out The Apocalypse?\nWALTER: We already know that Jones has created new species. Now it's possible that he has built a safe zone where he and his creations could be protected. After all, he will have to populate this new world.\nBROYLES: Like Noah's Ark? Is that what you say?\nWALTER: Something like that, yes.\nAIDE DE'CAMP: Mister Secretary, I have a message from Command.\nBROYLES: In this scenario, would there be anyone that could stop Jones?\nWALTER: Short of killing him. I don't know.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Dunham.\nBROYLES: Broyles.\nOLIVIA: Dunham.\nPETER: You did great, Walter.\nWALTER: He can't even stay in the same room as me.\nPETER: No. He listens to you. They all did.\nBROYLES: Emergency Services are receiving multiple reports of earthquakes all over the world.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Uh... worlds. It's happening in our side too.\nWALTER: It's Jones.\nAGENT FARNSWORTH: Twenty-seven earthquakes. Most of them occurred nowhere near the major fault lines registering between five point seven and seven point one on a Richter scale. And they all started at exactly the same time. Eleven twenty-three A.M. Greenwich Mean Time. AGENT LEE: The locations are the same in both universes? AGENT FARNSWORTH: Yes. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: Nepal. Buenos Aires. Beijing. The synchronized earthquakes are all over the world, it must have a trigger. Presumably Amphilicite. AGENT LEE: I'll coordinate with the other side to begin a search. I wonder how you say Amphilicite in Mandarin.\nASTRID: What is he doing? (as Walter conducts a sniff test on an athletic shoe from an evidence box) OLIVIA: Uh, we don\u2019t know. He said that he\u2019s not ready to tell us yet. PETER: So why these twenty-seven locations? Assuming that it is Jones, it can\u2019t just be random. There must be a Pattern. OLIVIA: (studying Jones choice of locales) So \u2013 what? I don\u2019t know - another test? WALTER: (joining the groupthink) No. This is not another test. I think I am starting to understand. The items in this box were recovered from the epicenter of the earthquake in Manhattan. Now, as we have seen, everything from our universe vibrates at a frequency of 261.6 hertz. The key of C. And things from the other universe at 392 hertz, a G. But these things (from the evidence box) vibrate at 329.6 hertz. PETER: The key of E. (?) WALTER: Precisely. I think I know what he is doing now. Jones is trying to tune the two universes to vibrate at a common frequency. And it\u2019s these vibrations that are creating the earthquakes. And.. I suspect that we will see many more because\u2026 the vibrations are weakening, uh, the barrier between our two universes. (demonstrates on a preshoolers hammer-the-ice toy) If he does it enough times (hammering free time segments of the toy) \u2026 in the right locations (toy surface fails) \u2026collapse is inevitable.\nFD AGENT: Agent Lee. You have a visitor.\n(Lee looks up from his workstation and sees a man about his age walking toward him)\nNICKLAUS LANE: Lincoln. Hi. I\u2019m Nick Lane. I don\u2019t know if you remember me, but we grew up in the same neighborhood in Philly. I was a couple of years behind you in school. You went out with my sister Kendra. AGENT LEE: (feigning familiarity) Nick. Right. Uh, good to see again. (playing along with the man who obviously has him pegged as the now deceased Captain Lee) So. What can I do for you? NICKLAUS LANE: (ernestly enough) I\u2019m really sorry to ambush like this, but, I really didn\u2019t want to call the HotLine, and you\u2019re the only person I know who\u2019s an actual Fringe Division agent. (hesitates. then confides) I had a vision. I saw the earthquakes. I was standing right in the middle of it. But the thing is, when this happened, I wasn\u2019t even aware there was an earthquake. I hadn\u2019t turned on the news yet. How is that possible?\nASTRID: Hey you guys. Check this out. (video footage on her screen) This is footage of the epicenter in Sydney, Australia, taken with a cell phone camera. See her? OLIVIA: She\u2019s just standing there. ASTRID: While everybody else runs for cover. PETER: You think she caused this? ASTRID: Well, she\u2019s standing at the epicenter. Maybe whatever device we\u2019re looking for, Jones\u2019 trigger, maybe it\u2019s on her. WALTER: Hmm. She\u2019s pretty. OLIVIA: Is this the best angle that we have? ASTRID: Yeah. I\u2019m afraid so. OLIVIA: Could you try and get a clearer image? (answers ringing cell phone. clears throat) Dunham AGENT LEE: (calling from the other universe) Hey. It\u2019s Me OLIVIA: Hey. What\u2019s up. AGENT LEE: I got a guy on this side who had a vision of standing in the middle of the earthquake in Manhattan. The way he described it\u2026 I think he saw the earthquake on your side. In our Manhattan. I think he was somehow remotely viewing it from this side. He said that in his vision there were no Twin Towers. OLIVIA: Do we know who he is? AGENT LEE: A citizen. His name is, uh, Nick Lane. (waiting for a reply as she searches her memory banks) You still there? OLIVIA: I\u2019ll call you back. (returns to the video with a hunch) ASTRID: (about the stoic young woman on-screen) It\u2019s not much better, but I\u2019m going to run it through Facial Recognition and see if we get a hit. OLIVIA: Uh, no need, her name is Sally Clark. ASTRID: (calls up Clark\u2019s ID data) Oh, you\u2019re right. OLIVIA: We were in the Cortexiphan Trials together along with another boy called Nick Lane PETER: Nick Lane? What does he have to do with this? OLIVIA: I don\u2019t think Jones is using Amphilicite devices to trigger these events \u2013 I think they are the devices. He\u2019s using Cortexiphan subjects.\nWALTER: It's horrible and deranged, but you have to agree, it's really quite ingenious. Doctor Jones is using Nick Lane and the other Cortexiphan subjects' abilities to psychically link with versions of themselves in the alternate universe. Meaning Nick Lane and the others are drawing on their alternate's frequency to change the vibratory nature of the area that they're standing in, effectively, merging the two universes together. ASTRID: Which is what's causing the earthquakes? WALTER: And the eventual collapse of our world. This man... I'm afraid I underestimated him. Jones must have a remarkable mind to have devised a plan like this. PETER: Walter... could the connection between our two universes be what's facilitating this psychic link? WALTER: I suppose. PETER: So what if we severed it? WALTER: You're not suggesting that -- PETER: Yes, I am. ASTRID: Suggesting what? PETER: That we close the Bridge. We turn off the machine. It cuts the link between our Cortexiphan subjects and their Doppelgangers. ASTRID: Walter, would that work? WALTER: In theory, yes. But if we were able to shut down the machine, we may never be able to start it again. Our two sides would be separated forever. OLIVIA: The Bridge being opened is what's enabled the other universe to heal. So what would happen if we closed it? WALTER: Most likely, the healing would stop. Their world wouldn't get any worse, but it wouldn't get any better either. PETER: There's no other alternative, Walter. WALTER: Well, that's easy for us to say, Peter. OLIVIA: Well, there is one other option. We find Jones, and we stop the next attack. PETER: But how? OLIVIA: I think I have an idea.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Crossing over takes some getting used to. You know, it was weird for me too, the first time. NICKLAUS LANE: So how's this gonna work? ASTRID: This is gonna pinch just a little. NICKLAUS LANE: Will any of this stuff hurt me? WALTER: Shouldn't. In fact, it may not do anything at all. But if we're lucky, it may help Agent Dunham find the man we're after. OLIVIA: I knew Nick when we were kids. We shared an emotional bond. And I'm hoping that through you, we may be able to reconnect and find him. NICKLAUS LANE: And this makes perfect sense to all of you. AGENT LEE: I find it's best if you just go with it. PETER: Think of it this way. If it works out, you're the hero that saved two universes. BROYLES: Look, I appreciate what you guys have been doing to prevent closing the bridge, even if it's a long shot. The truth is I like coming over here. Especially after it rains. Wh -- when my world started to break down, the conditions in the atmosphere changed. And the light doesn't reflect through moisture the way it used to. We haven't seen a rainbow in over twenty years. OLIVIA: Oh, I didn't know that. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: As our world started to repair itself, I began to imagine that the people from my side would start to see them again. You know, something so beautiful. So perfect. I still find myself looking up after it rains. ASTRID: We're ready for you. PETER: You shouldn't have to do too much. Olivia's gonna do most of the work. WALTER: One more thing. Have you ever tried LSD? OLIVIA: It's... it's hard to make out. Everything is blurry. But... I see brick buildings. It's older, like it's outside the city. Okay, he's... he's passing a -- a train station. Newburyport, Rockport. ASTRID: Peter, he's in Salem. PETER: Alright. Let him know we're on our way. Salem. AGENT LEE: Let's move! OLIVIA: He has a map. He's looking for something. I can make out people. Young, in their early Twenties. Salem Bay University. He's on campus. ASTRID: Peter, he's on campus. PETER: Go to the university. BOLIVIA DUNHAM: We need more, Walter. It's a big campus. WALTER: What else can you see, Dear? OLIVIA: More brick buildings. Nothing specific. AGENT LEE: Fan out. Nonlethal force only. PETER: Agent Bates, with me. OLIVIA: He's looking at his watch. No, it's a--it's a timer, and it's counting down. It's gonna happen again. He's gonna trigger another earthquake. He's in the Quad. PETER: We got him. Nick Lane! AGENT LEE: Don't move! ASTRID: They got him. But we didn't stop anything. It's starting. Seismic activity in Tulsa, Vancouver, Florence, Bogota....\nBROYLES: On the News they're saying that increased solar activity has caused fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field. Though they're still baffled by so many quakes happening at exactly the same time. How does David Robert Jones convince twenty-seven Cortexiphan-kids to help him destroy the world? PETER: Well, I doubt that was the sales pitch. The tech in that watch isn't from here. Meaning our side. So it's safe to assume that Jones is the one that gave it to him. BROYLES: Perhaps we can trace the parts. It's a long shot, but maybe something will lead us to Jones. PETER: Sure. BROYLES: So I'll ask what we're all thinking. If this is indeed how Jones intends to collapse our universes, how many more quakes will it take to make that happen? WALTER: Frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't already. BROYLES: I've been called to Washington. They want to discuss shutting off The Machine. I've been inclined to argue that we still have better options, but suddenly I'm not so sure. OLIVIA: Well, I should be the one to interrogate Nick Lane. Maybe I can get him to tell us where David Robert Jones is. BROYLES: What makes you think he'll do that? OLIVIA: We knew each other. As children.\nOLIVIA: Hello, Nick. Uh, I'm Olivia Dunham. And we actually knew each other a long time ago. NICK LANE: Olive. I remember you. You're FBI. Of course you are. OLIVIA: Nick, for reasons that you may or may not understand, we don't have a lot of time. I need you to tell me where David Robert Jones is. NICK LANE: I can't do that. OLIVIA: Nick, I -- NICK LANE: I won't. Olive, I'm sorry. But you don't have to worry about him. OLIVIA: Why don't I have to worry? NICK LANE: Look, I know they're watching. But we're on the same side. OLIVIA: Who? NICK LANE: You and me. Remember back when we were kids? What they prepared us for? It's happening. OLIVIA: What is happening, Nick? NICK LANE: What they warned us about. The War. And Jones is on our side. That's why you don't have to worry about him. He's protecting us. WALTER: Oh, no. BROYLES: What? WALTER: I think I understand. OLIVIA: So you're -- you're defending our world, you and the others. NICK LANE: I don't have any contact with the others. We each only speak with Jones. It's funny. I'd thought of you. Think I assumed you were working with us. I guess you have been, in a way. OLIVIA: I don't understand. Creating earthquakes? How is that protecting us? NICK LANE: Well, every war... has a cost, Olive. Earthquakes are just collateral damage. And you've seen. They're not that bad. But the damage on the other side is far worse. It's almost over. Jones has one more offensive, and the other side will surrender. NICK LANE: Okay, listen to me, Nick. OLIVIA: Jones has lied to you. Everything that he said. There's no war. Our two universes are allies now. Our world is helping to heal theirs. But Jones wants to destroy us both. And he's using you to help him. Where is Jones?\nPETER: Hmm. AGENT LEE: What? PETER: This resistor is labeled. Might be the only piece of the watch that's not off-market. AGENT LEE: You're thinking it could be traceable? PETER: It's a shot. What's their take on it? Closing the Bridge. AGENT LEE: They want to survive. The recovery process will stop. What can they do? PETER: It's weird to think of never seeing them again. Knowing that they're right there, so close. It's not the kind of thing you forget. If the Bridge does have to be closed, at least everything goes back to the way it's supposed to be. Well, almost everything. AGENT LEE: You mean you. Because you're from the other universe, but you're gonna stay here. PETER: I've come to the opinion that home is where the heart is. AGENT LEE: Did you do that? PETER: No.\nOLIVIA: They're about to happen again. The quakes. The timer started counting down. Nick, I know what I'm saying is upsetting you, but just consider for a moment that I'm right. That means that in less than six hours, everything you know, and everyone you may love will cease to exist. Right now, you're the only one that can stop that from happening. NICK LANE: Everyone I love? You look good, Olive. You were always the strong one. Me... I wasn't ever strong. When my family moved away from Jacksonville, I started having bad thoughts. And when I went to college, it got worse. I thought I was going crazy. And I had to make it stop. But even then, I was a coward. I was afraid that it would hurt. But I had heard that cutting your wrist was... almost pleasant. Kind of like drifting off to sleep. I had a sister. Kendra. The night I was gonna do it, I had the knife in my hand, and my parents called. Kendra was dead. Slit her wrists in the tub. A reverse empath. That's what Jones told me I had become. That my emotions were contagious. That is what Walter Bishop and William Bell did to me. A couple years ago, Jones found me. He knew all the old words. He said the truce was broken, that the other side was coming over now, that he needed warriors. He taught me how to control my feelings so I wouldn't hurt any more people. OLIVIA: Nick -- NICK LANE: No! He taught me how to channel the untapped energy in my brain so I could help protect our world. OLIVIA: I know that what Jones told you helped you to make sense of your life, and of what you've gone through, what we have gone through... but, Nick, what he told you was a lie. I've been over there, I've worked with the other side, and they are not our enemy. Nick. Even if you don't help us - we still have a way to stop Jones? But that would mean we would have to sever ties with the other side. We would stop healing their world. Now think of the fate of all those people. All those innocent people. You're the only person that can help them.\nOLIVIA: This is all the intel we've managed to collect from Jones's operation, but none of this tells us where he is. WALTER: We believe he has a plan to survive when the universes collapse. OLIVIA: We believe he's going to create some sort of safe zone. The eye, the -- the center of the hurricane. WALTER: And I imagine he would need an incredibly powerful force field. NICK LANE: Jones usually came to me. He had me meet him in public places. Never the same place twice. Although... one time I did meet him at a warehouse. It was filled with a bunch of equipment. Machines I didn't recognize. OLIVIA: Well, do you remember where it was? NICK LANE: Yes. I can take you back there.\nOLIVIA: So what do you think, Nick? NICK LANE: This is it. I remember the frosted windows. BROYLES: All teams move. PETER: You hear that? OLIVIA: You think it's Jones's 'Safe Zone'?\nPETER: Walter did say he'd need to generate a powerful force field. AGENT TIM: Hey. It's okay. NICK LANE: No. They've been in there for too long. Something went wrong. AGENT TIM: You don't know that. NICK LANE: He lied to me. And I didn't even question it. Do you know how that feels? I'm pathetic. I should have just done it. I should have killed myself. I'm miserable. Worthless. You feel that, don't you? BRAVO COMM: Team Bravo, East Wing is clear. We've got nothing. TANGO COMM: Team Tango, clear. DELTA COMM: Team Delta, all clear as well. OLIVIA: There's nothing here. PETER: This is just an air conditioning unit. AGENT TIM: (on comm after Lane escapes) Agent Dunham, we have a problem. (when she gets to the car) I'm sorry. Suddenly I just got so sad, so mad at myself, I just wanted it to end. PETER: I need a Medic! Now! OLIVIA: It's Nick. He made Tim do it. It was all a lie.\nBROYLES: Washington has made their decision. They'll support whatever we decide in this room. OLIVIA: According to Nick Lane's watch, the next wave of earthquakes are due to begin in less than an hour. SECRETARY BISHOP: Okay. In that case... unless someone can think of an alternative, something we haven't considered yet...\nWALTER: No? I'm afraid we have to close 'The Bridge'.\nPETER: Ready for me?\nWALTER: Yes, we are.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: System overload initiated.\nPETER: So what happens now?\nWALTER: We wait for the power to surge. Then we shut it down.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at five percent.\nPETER: How long do you think that's gonna take?\nWALTER: Not long.\nPETER: I'll tell the others.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: This biomechanical interface of yours...\nWALTER: Peter and I figured it out. Back when we thought The Machine was the key to his returning home. Back to his timeline.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ten percent.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: He's really quite a remarkable boy, Peter. Man, actually.\nWALTER: Yes, he is.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Smart... Noble... Kind... all the things I would've wished for him.\nWALTER: Would you excuse me for a moment?\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at fifteen percent.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: I know what you're afraid of. It occurs to me, so I'm sure it occurs to you too, that if The Machine stops working, Peter may disappear.\nWALTER: I believe it may have brought him here. There's no reason it can't take him away.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Twenty-five years ago, you couldn't have made this decision. You didn't. I've come to accept that he's not ours. \"The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.\"\nWALTER: Marcus Aurelius.\nSECRETARY BISHOP: Philosopher King who survived a war, and spent the rest of his life working for the betterment of his people. Perhaps we will too.\nWALTER: We'll see.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety percent.\nPETER: Broyles. It's time.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety-one percent.\nPETER: Strange days, huh?\nAGENT LEE: Remember how you said, \"Home is where the heart is\"? This might be crazy, but...\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety-two percent.\nAGENT LEE: I think I found mine.\nPETER: It's been a pleasure working with you, Lincoln. And getting to be your friend.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety-three percent.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: You know, there's a lot of things about you that I wish I had. There's a lot of things about you that I admire.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety-four percent.\nOLIVIA: That's funny. I was about to say the same thing about you. Keep looking up. After it rains. Keep looking up.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: I will.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety-five percent.\nAGENT LEE: Thought you could use a little help. I'm gonna need you to help me find an apartment.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload at ninety-six percent. Overload at ninety-seven percent. Overload at ninety-eight percent. Overload at ninety-nine percent. Overload at one-hundred percent.\nWALTER: That's it.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload. Overload.\nWALTER: It's time.\nSYNTHETIC VOICE: Overload. (voom)\nWALTER: I think I shall miss them... more than I imagined."

Cafe Mocha, one percent, no whip?\nNEAL: That's it.\nBARISTA: Jill, can you get that started? That'll be Four-Eighty. (after he Wi-Fi's his payment) Enjoy.\nPASSERBY: Are you okay? (as Neil collapses just outside of a main entrance to the building, as he starts venting steam and smoke. after a dozen others collapse and die within a few seconds) What's happening to them?\nINFESTED WOMAN: (freezing in position) Don't move. I think when they move, they die. (to those still alive) Nobody move!\nPETER: (laying in bed going through the Real estate section of the newspaper) Medford?\nOLIVIA: (resting her head and listening) No.\nPETER: Holliston?\nOLIVIA: Uh, only if I am being punished.\nPETER: Wayburn?\nOLIVIA: (jokingly) Only if I'm dead.\nPETER: Alright. (flips page) How about Lexington? Three beds, central heat and air, dog run. Did you know that I had a Lab when I was growing up?\nOLIVIA: No, I thought you were allergic.\nPETER: I was, but Walter made him non-allergenic. It's got a working fireplace in the bedroom.\nOLIVIA: Nursery?\nPETER: (perks-up) Nursery?\nOLIVIA: (tantalizing) Nursery.\n(a tender kiss never follows as both of their phones activate simultaneously)\nWALTER: (to Astrid) What's he doing? (directing technicians in protective gear as they examine the dead) No! o-- over by the second woman! The one that's still smoking. No, you ninny. The next one over!\nASTRID: Walter. {buttons his jacket. distracts his coaching) You are going to freeze, gawd!\nWALTER: (snippy) Why must you always mother hen me? I'm quite capable of looking after myself.\nASTRID: (caring) I know, but just humor me. Maybe I like doing it.\nHAZMAT TECHNICIAN: (approaches. removes helmet\/hood) We're good. No airborne toxins.\nWALTER: Thank you. (rushes under the barricade tape)\nASTRID: Walter! Don't forget your--\nWALTER: (returns to Astrid) I need my kit.\nASTRID: (has the kit waiting) Yeah.\nINFESTED WOMAN: (timidly. as Walter infiltrates the mass casualty environment) Please, do something. Help us.\nWALTER: (spots cell phone on ground and examines it) Maybe the deaths are associated with this mobile transaction.\nASTRID: No, Walter, this is just how people pay for things now.\nWALTER: Hmm?\nASTRID: (spots the toppled beverage nearby) Uh, he probably just bought that coffee.\nWALTER: Huh. What will they think of next?\nBROYLES: (walking through the interior promenade of the building with Olivia and Peter) All we know so far, at Three Twenty-three P.M. more than two dozen people experienced some kind of spontaneous human combustion.\nPETER: You know that's a myth, right?\nBROYLES: There are survivors. Remaining still seems to have halted the ignition process... for now.\nPETER: Do have any idea what's caused this?\nBROYLES: I'm hoping Doctor Bishop can help shed some light on that.\nWALTER: (examines a still smoldering corpse inside the facility. natters to the deceased) Okay, my friend. Let's see what secrets you hold. Hmm. I -- I had a watch similar to this once. My uncle gave it to me. Uncle Heinrich. He loved rhubarb. He was always...\nJESSICA HOLT: (frustrated at the lack of action to rectify her immobilized state) ...am I gonna die?\nWALTER: (caught off guard by the inquiry) I -- I can't answer that. Not yet.\nJESSICA HOLT: What are you?\nWALTER: (disconnected from the reality of her plight) What am -- I'm human. What are you? Is this some sort of alien invasion? Are you part of a strike f...\nJESSICA HOLT: (clarifying to stop his prattling) No, I mean -- I mean, what are you doing here? Are you a doctor?\nWALTER: Oh, no. I'm a scientist. Uh... May I take a blood sample? The discomfort will only be momentary.\nJESSICA HOLT: (dark flirt) That's what all you men say.\nWALTER: (appreciates her bluster) You are very brave.\nJESSICA HOLT: (surrenders. worried) Go on, then.\nWALTER: (as he draws blood from her arm) I'm sorry... um, where did you get this smudging on your fingertips?\nJESSICA HOLT: I don't know. (looks around) The escalator, maybe?\n(later, as the scene is being processed, the ashen removed, and the surviving grow tired of their motionlessness. Astrid runs the blood sample through a high-res microscope)\nASTRID: Her blood definitely shows signs of a foreign incursion at the cellular level.\nWALTER: Viral?\nASTRID: We're gonna have to get it back to the lab to be sure.\nWALTER: (holds-up the vial of blood for contemplation) What sort of virus are you? If you were aerolized, you would have infected everyone, not just those on the escalator. If you were harbored on a water tap or a doorknob, the first few contacts would have wiped you clean. What would have kept you fresh and so infectious, my lethal friend?\nTECHNICIAN: (to Astrid, summoning from the base of the escalator landing) Agent, I think we found something.\nWALTER: (studies the odd tech device attached to the handrail assembly) Oh, dear. This is not a virus at all.\nASTRID: Well, then what is it?\n(to the entire team once Olivia and Peter have their briefing from Broyles)\nWALTER: The escalator is infested with nanites.\nOLIVIA: Nanites?\nASTRID: They are microscopic self-replicating robotics. There's a machine that's generating them.\nWALTER: (approaching Jessica) Despite their itty-bitty size, each of them is capable of storing a tremendous amount of energy, and it would seem they can be overloaded by the bio-kinetic energy stored in the cells of anyone infected.\nPETER: You mean, these people's movement is what's activating the nanites?\nWALTER: (snippy) That's what I just said. And the longer they are in the bloodstream, the more sensitive they become, so that the slightest exertion can trigger the overload.\nPETER: Causing them to spontaneously combust.\nWALTER: (fatalistic) Like a soda pop bottle after shaking.\nOLIVIA: (trying to facilitate) Okay, so who would do this, and how do we stop it?\nWALTER: I don't know. I need my lab.\nASTRID: Well we can't move them, Walter. How are we gonna get one of these people to your...\nWALTER: (earnest) Very carefully.\nOLIVIA: Walter, we can't risk it.\nWALTER: I don't know how long they have left, even without moving them. I can't be certain.\nJESSICA HOLT: (interjecting) Do you have any kind of insurance? I mean, if I volunteer for your experiment and something goes wrong, what happens, you know, to my next of kin?\nASTRID: (matter-of-factly. reassuring) The Bureau takes care of you. Everybody that we work on is fully-covered. It's in the regs.\nJESSICA HOLT: Okay. (surrenders her fate) You can use me. Whatever you need.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry, what's your name?\nJESSICA HOLT: Jessica Holt.\nOLIVIA: Do you know what you're saying, Jessica?\nJESSICA HOLT: (gulps in hesitation) Yeah, I do.\nWALTER: (summons nearby support personnel) I need a solid-board stretcher, uh, and some ice packs and a blanket.\nOLIVIA: (to the Walter's volunteer guinea pig as she fidgets on the gurney) Must seem a little bizarre, huh?\nJESSICA HOLT: Well, I'm an E.R. nurse. Night shifts on Fridays, that's bizarre. (nervous laughter)\nOLIVIA: If there anything that I can do to make it a little more pleasant, please let me know.\nJESSICA HOLT: Actually, there is. Um, could you get my phone for me, please? It's in my handbag.\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nJESSICA HOLT: (when she gets her phone) Thank you. (calls out) Mike, it's me. No, I know. Um. yeah. listen, I, um, I need you to pick up Sarah after school for me, please. No, I -- I know it's not your day, um, but, you know, please, Mike. Um, I'll explain it to you later, okay? Okay, bye. Thanks.\nOLIVIA: Of course.\nJESSICA HOLT: Olivia, how long until this antidote is ready?\nOLIVIA: I'll just check with Walter. How close are we?\nWALTER: We're starting to see first results now.\nOLIVIA: But how long is it going to take?\nPETER: At this rate, it's gonna be at least a couple of more minutes.\nASTRID: Hey Walter, her temperature's rising rapidly.\nWALTER: How rapidly?\nASTRID: Uh, two degrees in the past twenty-three seconds.\nOLIVIA: What about an ice bath?\nWALTER: No, that won't help. just try to keep her calm.\nOLIVIA: Jessica? Jessica, I just want you to focus on me, okay?\nJESSICA HOLT: Okay.\nWALTER: Peter, grab the Ammonium Nitrate.\nPETER: You want to speed up the condensation?\nWALTER: Not unless you have a better idea.\nASTRID: Walter, she's at one hundred four degrees.\nWALTER: Uh, we need sixty seconds more.\nASTRID: We don't have sixty seconds.\nJESSICA HOLT: Oh, my God. Get away from me!\nOLIVIA: Oh, here. (takes her hand) Jessica, just focus on your breathing.\nASTRID: Walter!\nWALTER: Forty seconds more!\nJESSICA HOLT: (as Olivia concentrates and relieves the stress of her overheating nanites) How are you doing that?\nASTRID: Her temperature's dropping. (all of the electrical power in the lab drains temporarily) Oh.... She's okay.\nJESSICA HOLT: (feeling much better) How did you do that?\nOLIVIA: (just as amazed) I have no idea.\n(after the crisis has abated and they prepare to release Holt)\nPETER: (injecting the anti-nanite serum into her arm) This should permanently remove and neutralize the nanites in your system.\nJESSICA HOLT: Thank you. I can breathe now.\nPETER: You and a lot of other people.\nOLIVIA: (privately) Walter, do you have any idea what just happened to me?\nWALTER: I could make an educated guess. Cortexiphan has given you certain kinetic powers. Moving molecules so quickly that you can create spontaneous combustion, yes? Well, perhaps in this case, you slowed the molecules down, causing her to cool down.\nOLIVIA: (no clue) But how did I do it?\nWALTER: I'm afraid I have no idea.\nOLIVIA: I should get her home.\n(outside the lab. walking across the busy campus to a waiting taxi)\nJESSICA HOLT: You'll let me know what happens with the others, then?\nOLIVIA: I will, but now that the antidote's been synthesized, they'll all be fine, thanks to you.\nJESSICA HOLT: Thank you. I don't know how you did it, but you did.\nOLIVIA: You know, not everybody would volunteer to be Walter's guinea pig.\nJESSICA HOLT: It wasn't really for me. I've got a four-foot-tall redhead at home who's constantly in dire need of Mac and Cheese and help with her math. And her father's an idiot. (giggles at the girl talk) Well, if you ever need help getting to the head of the line in an E.R...\nOLIVIA: And listen, if you find that you have any more symptoms, give me a call. (hands over her business card)\nJESSICA HOLT: I will. (upbeat over her new friendship)\nOLIVIA: Thank you.\nJESSICA HOLT: Thank you.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nBROYLES: (calling from office) We know who's responsible for the nanites.\nBROYLES: (talking to the big screen footage once Olivia and Peter have joined him) This was taken ten minutes before the first victim was reported. (footage of David Jones tinkering in the escalator maintenance bay) Another camera picked him up leaving the scene, but we lost him after that.\nPETER: Well, at least we know Jones is in our universe.\nOLIVIA: So what does infecting a bunch of people with nanites have to do with ending the world? I mean, everything Jones has done has been in service of collapsing our two universes in order to create a third.\nBROYLES: But destroying The Bridge ruined that plan.\nOLIVIA: As far as we know.\nBROYLES: You think he found another way to create his own universe in place of ours?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nPETER: But we do know Jones. We know he's not gonna just give up.\nWALTER: That can't be. (studying the nanites in a microscope) A chimeric structure in nanites. I don't believe it.\nASTRID: (returning from inner office) That was Olivia. David Robert Jones is definitely behind this. (sees the concern on his face) Walter, what is it?\nWALTER: A hundred different ways to design a nanite, and he chose this. It's inconceivable. Not by chance. Jones isn't smart enough, not by himself.\nASTRID: Wait, what are you saying?\nWALTER: Jones didn't create these nanites. They're not his design! There's only one person who would construct this particular pattern.\nASTRID: Who?\nDAVID JONES: (enters the admiral's lounge) I have bad news, sir. Agent Dunham has stopped us again.\nWILLIAM BELL: (turns from the porthole) Don't be so sure.\nDAVID JONES: Olivia beat us today. Clearly, you don't seem concerned.\nWILLIAM BELL: Don't confuse a winning move with a winning game.\nDAVID JONES: (looks at large chess table) This board never changes. How long do you take between moves?\nWILLIAM BELL: Since the last move... about twenty years. In this game, the skill one must have above all else is patience. The board changes, but very slowly. The art of chess -- the art -- is knowing when a piece is most valuable, and then, in that very moment, being willing to sacrifice it. For in the vacuum created by the loss of what is most precious, opportunity abounds, influence is maximized, and desire becomes destiny. For example, on this board, the most valuable piece is the Bishop. (picks-up the game piece) Therefore, for the game to be won...\nDAVID JONES: ...the Bishop must be sacrificed. I'll attend to it.\nWILLIAM BELL: Promptly.\n(standing amid the packing boxes as Massive Dynamic leaves the former joint facility)\nWALTER: (emphasizing to Nina) He's alive. I'm telling you, he's alive I knew that Jones's plan was too ingenious, too remarkable, that it had to have come from Belly. He's alive, Nina. The 'nanotech' that Jones used on the escalator, I've examined them. They were built by Belly. I -- I'd recognize his work anywhere. His methodology was all ov...\nNINA: Jones had access to many projects at Massive Dynamic. He could simply have copied William's research..\nWALTER: (adamant) Nina! It was the work of a master, not an imposter! I know the difference.\nOLIVIA: Walter said that Bell died in a car accident on New Year's day seven years ago?\nNINA: Yes. I went to the hospital. I saw his body. But it wasn't New Year's, it was Christmas.\nWALTER: (not processing the discrepancy) I -- I always thought that he died on New Year, because he came to visit me the night before to say goodbye.\nOLIVIA: Walter, what are you talking about?\nWALTER: When I was in Saint Claire's, Belly came to visit me.\nWALTER: It was New Year's Eve, 2005. (angered) They gave me additional shocks that day just to celebrate, so I can't remember what he said. Nina, I know you loved him --\nNINA: (frustrated) Oh, Walter, just stop it! The car crash wasn't an accident. William had Lymphoma. He'd been trying to fight it, but... (gets emotional) I think he didn't want me to see him that way anymore. He didn't want to be vulnerable. He wanted to go out on his own terms, and he did.\nWALTER: It's still possible --\nNINA: (still frustrated) Oh, Walter, anything is possible, but the man I knew wouldn't try to destroy a universe. That doesn't sound like William.\nWALTER: (resolved) Fine. I'll prove it to you. If my son is not too busy monitoring my cure, I'd like him to meet us.\nOLIVIA: Where? (as they leave)\n(from three hours south-south-west of Boston to an hour's drive north-north-east of Boston. Walter sits in an holding cell and studies the equations scribbled there. nostalgia is the furthest thing from his mind)\nORDERLY: (mopping in the hallway, as Walter solemnly leaves his old stomping grounds) Well, well... Wally Bishop. Hey, Doc, you just visiting, or are you coming back to stay for awhile? (the noire humor terrifies Walter)\nPETER: (waves as he locates Walter) Good news. The Administrator can see us now. Everything okay?\nWALTER: Fine. (decidedly not)\nDOCTOR BENLO: (sitting at her desk as she briefs the seated science team) I'm sorry, we're still transitioning to a more up-to-date record-keeping system. Federal funding isn't all it used to be. In fairness, I'm told it never was particularly good, so, technically, it never was what it used to be. I guess now it's just worse. But I'm confident these are all the visitor logs during the period of Doctor Bishop's...\nWALTER: Incarceration.\nDOCTOR BENLO: I was going to say 'treatment'. It has a nicer sound, and I like to think is more reflective of what we do here.\nWALTER: Would you, now?\nPETER: (breaking the tension Walter generated) What about your surveillance archives? Uh, security cameras?\nDOCTOR BENLO: I'm afraid our current mainframe storage capacity is limited. The institution doesn't keep anything older than two years.\nWALTER: (brewing) Convenient.\nOLIVIA: (diffusing his ire) Walter, Doctor Benlo has been cooperating fully. Now do you see anything in those that suggests the logs have been doctored?\nWALTER: No. Matter of fact, they're perfect. Very thorough. Every single individual logged in and out.\nPETER: And? No William Bell.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you said you had been having a lot of shock therapy. Do you think perhaps he could have been a hallucination?\nWALTER: No. No. My hallucinations were rarely biped and never men. (begins huffing. smells, then tastes the log book)\nDOCTOR BENLO: Doctor Bishop, are you --\nWALTER: Crazy? No. May I borrow this? (the log book)\nDOCTOR BENLO: Uh, um, Well, those records have already been digitized, I -- I --\nWALTER: Thank you. Let's go. (bolts from chair)\nOLIVIA: (low key and apologetic) Thank you.\nWALTER: (quickly sticks his head back in the office) I must say, you're much prettier than your predecessor.\nPETER: (returning to the kitchen) I still don't know why Walter needed that log book, and he's not telling me, and he won't back off that Bell thing, either. Oh, man. Oh. one, second, hold on. I got it.\nOLIVIA: (clips her fingertip with a chef's knife while prepping dinner) God.\nPETER: (rushes the first-aid) Oh, that's got to smart. That's what happens when you drink and mince.\nOLIVIA: (about the first-aid) Thank you. (sighs. distracted by life)\nPETER: What's the matter? You worried about Walter too, 'cause honestly, you shouldn't be. I'm sure he's --\nOLIVIA: No, I'm not thinking about Walter. I was thinking about that girl, Jessica. Oh, one encounter with us and her child almost becomes an orphan. And we deal with this every day. (emotional baggage grows heavy) We're playing the odds, Peter. I mean, what do you really think our chances are of having a normal life?\nPETER: (assuring) Olivia, I know you're scared about what happened in the lab yesterday.\nOLIVIA: I don't know what's happening to me. What I'm becoming. I've got this -- this power inside me that terrifies me because I don't understand it, (stifled by new burden) and I just -- I just want it out.\nPETER: Okay. (pinky swear) So we'll figure it out. Together.\nOLIVIA: Is that a personal guarantee? (receives guarantee signed & sealed with a tender kiss)\nPETER: (close. lovingly) After all we've been through, I will not lose you again, Olivia. I'm starving. What's a guy got to do to get a good home-cooked meal around here?\n(both migrate to the window to check-out the light show filling the urban skyline. Broyles catches the event as he returns to his parked vehicle. a substantial beam of light focuses a destructive path through a large building as it descends from high Earth orbit)\nWALTER: (on comm from the lab) Where are you now?\nOLIVIA: (driving quickly through the urban streets toward the powerful beam of light) We're just passing Kenmore Square. Now, what do you mean, it's the Sun?\nWALTER: Well, even though we can't see it, it's still there in the sky. Jones must be reflecting the light off of something, like one of those disco balls, and then focusing it, like we do with a magnifying glass.\nOLIVIA: Well, how is he doing that?\nWALTER: Well, I'm not sure yet, but I have my suspicions.\nASTRID: (on separate cell phone call from her workstation in the lab) Yeah, Farnsworth. Agent ID: J-H-1-1-2-4-0-2.\nOLIVIA: And why is he doing it? Seems like he's trying to burn a hole to China.\nWALTER: It's a myth. Technically, it would be India, but I doubt it.\nPETER: What does this have to do with nanites? And how do we even know it's Jones?\nWALTER: So you are now prepared to concede that this may well be the work of William Bell?\nPETER: Not my point.\nASTRID: Okay, thanks.\nWALTER: Satellite imagery?\nASTRID: Yeah, I just got access to the system.\nWALTER: Radio waves.\nASTRID: It's coming online right now.\nWALTER: I need geological data on Beacon Hill.\nASTRID: Walter, which one of these do you want me to do first? (really needing priority for his multi-tasking)\nWALTER: (nonchalant) All of them. Uh, you said that Agent Broyles was on-site? Is he evacuating the area?\nOLIVIA: (on comm from SUV) Yes, one square mile from the center of the beam.\nASTRID: Okay, Walter, the geological is printing.\nWALTER: (studies the print-out) Oh, no.\nASTRID: Oh, no, what?\nWALTER: I knew I'd read something about this. Three months ago, a subterranean oil reservoir was discovered below Beacon Hill.\nASTRID: What does that mean?\nWALTER: (to Astrid) Imagine putting a match to a can of lighter fluid. Unless we stop this soon, the sunbeam will essentially set Boston on fire from below. (over comm link) Uh, Peter, you should alert Agent Broyles. Tell him that he'll need to evacuate an area, uh, with a radius much wider than one mile.\nPETER: Well, how much?\nWALTER: All of it.\nPETER: All of what?\nWALTER: Boston.\nPETER: (raised eyebrows to Olivia) We'll call you back.\nASTRID: (studies her computer screen) Walter, you're right. There is a radio frequency that's not owned by the government that's transmitting in the S-Band.\nWALTER: What's the frequency?\nASTRID: 2-2-0-2 point 5-1-8 Actually, there's two frequencies.\nWALTER: What?\nASTRID: Also point 5-2-0.\nWALTER: Of course. You brilliant bastard, Belly. Quick, give me something to write on.\nOLIVIA: (answers new call from the lab) Dunham.\nWALTER: Turn around, head South! (plotting coordinates on dry-erase board) Towards Beech Street, on the edge of Chinatown.\nPETER: Why? What's there?\nWALTER: I believe that's where Jones is commanding the satellites from.\nPETER: What satellites, Walter?\nWALTER: I think Jones has commandeered two private satellites, or maybe he'd launched them, and they're the disco balls that are bouncing the sunlight around the planet. In any case, I have triangulated the signals, and they appear to be coming from the 1600 Block off Beech Street. (grumpier than usual) Interrupt the signals and you shut off the Sun. Well, you know what I mean.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we're on our way.\nWALTER: Ah! Get me a knife. My lemon cake's ready.\nASTRID: Walter, if you were hungry, I could've gotten you something.\nWALTER: This is not about food, Athos, this is about Bell. Where's the knife? Please, quickly?\nPETER: (as they park and look to the rooftops. pea coats buttoned) Hoo. Alright. This is the 1600 Block. See anything?\nOLIVIA: Peter, look. (points to a roof) That antenna. Do you think that's what's controlling the satellites?\nPETER: Could be. (turns and point to a second rooftop) There's the other one. (retrieves tactical radios from trunk of car) Okay, I'll take this one, you take the other one.\nOLIVIA: Okay, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\nPETER: We got to turn them off. We'll figure it out when we get up there.\n(a man sits in a parked vehicle at the end of the dark alleyway between the two antennae. David Jones watches and selects his quarry as Peter and Olivia enter separate buildings)\nASTRID: (returns with the requested knife) Oh, my God, that smells terrible. What is it?\nWALTER: Lemon cake, laced with pig brain. (as he slits open the top of the taste treat)\nASTRID: What?\nWALTER: Hmm? Lemon cake is the perfect incubator. (taps the cake out of the mold and removes the papery contents) And I thought it was easier to get pig brain on short notice than a human specimen.\nASTRID: Is that from the -- the log book at Saint Claire's?\nWALTER: Just the relevant page. I first tried scraping it, hoping Belly left some DNA behind, but he was too clever for that.\nASTRID: (doubtful) Or maybe he was never there in the first place.\nWALTER: I know none of you believe me, which is why I have conducted this little experiment. The pig brain is activating a little-known side effect of Cortexiphan, which is temporary tissue regeneration. Heated between ninety and a hundred degrees, the Cortexiphan I have added to the pig brain should cause at least partial regeneration of all biological matter on the sheet of paper, and voil\u00e0, fingerprints! (studies the newly generated bio-pattern) Although... identifying Belly's prints from these smudges may prove impossible, after all.\nASTRID: (points at a smudge) What is that brown mark?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nASTRID: Walter. (as the slit on the cake surface re-seals itself)\nWALTER: As I said, Cortexiphan is regenerative. You shouldn't eat it, though. (smells, then tastes the logbook extract) Almond oil. I knew it! Chilean almonds!\nASTRID: Almonds?\nWALTER: Belly was obsessed with them. Even had an agreement with the importers. They sold them to him wholesale. He must've had the oil on his fingertips.\nASTRID: (follows as he races to his office to change jackets) Walter, what are you doing?\nWALTER: I'm going to find Belly. A-1 Imports, down by the Seaport.\nASTRID: Walter, would you stop? This is nuts.\nWALTER: I am not crazy. At least I'll be able to confirm that he's still alive. Would you excuse me?\nASTRID: Oh. What about Olivia and Peter?\nWALTER: They're doing everything they can. There's nothing we can do to help them.\nASTRID: What do you think you're gonna find there? (follows him to the exit) Walter. Walter!\nWALTER: I know this is a 'wild goose chase', a fool's errand, and I'm a fool, but no one is asking you to join me, Alex. It's my hunch, and I'm quite capable of pursuing it on my own, so peace out. (leaves the lab. returns a few seconds later after Astrid has grabbed her jacket and keys) I don't...\nASTRID: ...drive. Alex?\nWALTER: (humbled) I was on a roll.\nASTRID: Mm-hmm. (heads for the parking lot)\n(maintaining radio contact a few hundred feet apart on separate rooftops)\nOLIVIA: (snaps the access panel open at the base of her uplink tower) Got it.\nPETER: You found the control panel?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Now find the dial... marked 'transmission amplitude'. That's the one that needs to be tuned all the way down.\nOLIVIA: Okay, got it. (finds the dial with her flashlight and starts to execute his instructions)\nPETER: But not yet! Not--not--not yet. Sorry. We have to do it together. If we don't, the beam could go off-kilter, cut a swath across Boston. It'd be sort of like don't cross the streams, just, you know, in reverse.\nOLIVIA: (fails to comprehend his movie trivia reference) You know I have no idea what you're talking about.\nPETER: Yes, I know.\nOLIVIA: Okay, tell me when.\nPETER: Okay, in Three... Two... One... Go. (rotating gauges in unison. the amp gauges drop to zero and the towers cease broadcasting. the focused light beam piercing Boston dissolves back into the night) We did it. Good job. (Peter turns and receives a shot to the side with a heavy bar) Oh! (Jones offers up one of his waffle-stompers next)\nPETER: (as Jones continues his ambush attack, Peter catches another heavy blow from the metal bar) Oh!\nDAVID JONES: (as Peter connects with a blow of his own) Ooh!\nOLIVIA: (draws her weapon, but hesitates shooting from so far away) Jones!\nPETER: Oof. Ah!\nDAVID JONES: Ah!\nPETER: (takes another whack from the heavy bar. this one dislocates his shoulder) Ooohhh!\nSECURITY #1: (private uniformed guards draw their pistols and point them at the intruder on their roof) Hey! Security!\nOLIVIA: I -- I'm FBI.\nSECURITY #1: Drop your weapon!\nOLIVIA: I -- I can show you my badge. (wanting to cooperate)\nSECURITY #1: (unwilling to let the armed intruder retain her weapon) I said, drop it! Now!\nSECURITY #2: (as Olivia tosses her pistol down a few feet off to her side, she telekinetically, and unexpectedly, commands the guards to discard their weapons too. just as surprised as she is) How did you?\n(realizing Peter is losing his struggle one rooftop away, Olivia gathers her composure and focuses on delivering whatever assistance her newfound ability can offer. first. get Jones off of Peter)\nDAVID JONES: (as Olivia helps Peter deliver a sharp elbow strike with his good arm) Oh!\nPETER: (second. tough love. time to get that shoulder back in the socket. as Olivia rotates her shoulder and projects the same action for him) Aah! Aah! (in horrific pain)\nDAVID JONES: (third. payback. time to wail on Jones as Olivia commands Peter through a series of uppercut and roundhouse punches) Aah!\nPETER: (tackles Jones into the electrical array) Ugh!\n(victorious in the tag team match-up, Peter turns to visually check Olivia standing on the next building over. other than his damaged shoulder, both seem well enough. laying on the ground and fading fast, Jones realizes his role in Bell's life-long chess game)\nDAVID JONES: I got it wrong. I was the sacrifice. (turns to make eye contact with Peter as the nanites in his bloodstream do their job) I was the Bishop. Ugh. (as the smoke and steam escape his soon-to-be corpse and half his skull sloughs off in a pile of crematorium-quality ashes)\n(the Bishop Vista Cruiser, with Astrid at the helm, finds it way to the damp, dark docks. this particular warehouse with the tramp steamer tied-up next to it is the place Walter remembers Bell satisfied his almond addiction)\nASTRID: (as they park the station wagon and head for a door to the warehouse) Tail fins?\nWALTER: Yes. Tail fins, whitewall tires, two-tone paint jobs. Oh, sure, by today's standards they're terrible for the environment, but, oh, there's something to be said for style. A-1 Imports. Come on, Dear.\nASTRID: Walter, they're probably not even -- (as he opens the unlocked door)\nWALTER: Ye of little faith. It's just as I remember it. (moving through the large, empty storage area) I used to accompany Belly here on his visits. Not a smell you forget.\nASTRID: It smells like sweat.\nWALTER: Exactly.\nTOM: Hello?\nWALTER: (politely to the longshoreman) Hello, sir. My name is Walter Bishop. I'm sorry to trouble you so late. I was hoping to speak with Ms Weisberg.\nTOM: I'm sorry, who?\nWALTER: Lynn Weisberg. Uh, lovely woman, yea high. Nice laugh.\nASTRID: Walter, I don't think he knows her.\nWALTER: Hmm? She's the owner. Or she was. I -- I -- I was hoping to ask her about a particular customer.\nTOM: Oh, I think I get it. You're talking about that import-export company. Well, they went out of business, three years ago. (demands Astrid's wariness when he unintentionally exposes the holstered pistol under his jacket) WALTER: Oh, I see.\nRADIO CALL: Tom, do you copy?\nTOM: (transmits) Yes, I'm here. Coming right now. (to his visitors) Look, I have to go.\nASTRID: Um, thanks for your help. Sorry to have bothered you.\nTOM: No bother. (moves to another part of the warehouse. leaving the duo to find their own way out)\nWALTER: Maybe we should ask around. maybe someone else --\nASTRID: Walter, he had a gun.\nWALTER: What? (rationalizing) Well... it's a dangerous neighborhood.\nASTRID: Whatever the reason, there are no almonds here.\nWALTER: (a faint roaring sound wafts from the far side of the warehouse) Did you hear that?\nASTRID: Yes. Walter!\nWALTER: (quietly) Come on. Come on. (scurries to investigate)\nASTRID: Walter. (hesitantly follows)\nWALTER: (as forklifts and longshoreman move storage containers around in a sequestered part of the facility) What are those? (looking at the assembled strangeness) One of them sounds almost like a rhino, but more nasal.\nASTRID: (to Tom as they are surrounded by armed men) I'm sorry. We were leaving, and then we heard a noise.\nTOM: (confronts the intruders he just left. to an accomplice) Go and tell him we have visitors.\nASTRID: Sir, I'm with the FBI. You're making a mis--\nARMED GUARD: Stop! Hands where I can see 'em.\nASTRID: Look, this is all just a misunderstanding. (as she karate kicks the man and grabs Walter to flee)\nWAREHOUSEMAN: Aah! (falling from the martial arts strike)\nASTRID: Walter, come on! Oh.\n(dodging bullets. Astrid returns fire and drops one pursuer. others converge and begin to block in Team Fringe. Tom is the first to isolate the runners. doing all she can to protect Walter in the gunfight, Astrid collapses when a single round from Tom's pistol catches her in the gut)\nWALTER: Whoa! oh! oh. (rushes to side of his best friend) Oh! oh! no! no! (nearly in tears, he looks up and sees the man he was hoping to encounter, only under much less violent circumstances)\nWILLIAM BELL: I'm not sure I ever thought I would see you again. (saunters closer) Hello, old friend."

It's taken me considerably longer. Beautiful. Isn't it? (the pastoral scene evaporates when he clicks the remote and the advanced 3-D imaging in his state room fades) Well, I can't wait for you to see the real thing. It's going to be magnificent. As soon as I finish making it.\nWALTER: William, you can't do this. You can't.\nWILLIAM BELL: It's done, Walter. The final piece has been set into motion. I couldn't stop it now if I wanted to. And I don't. (professorial) As scientists, we're taught that fate is nothing more than the convergence of a set of probabilities into one potential outcome... that there's no such thing as Divine Intervention. And yet I\u2019d be lying if I said that the circumstances that brought you here to witness this with me, my trusted colleague, my dearest friend, didn't feel like the Hand of God.\nWALTER: There was nothing divine about it. I found you.\nWILLIAM BELL: Yes, you did. After all these years. That's what I said. Providence. (maniacal delight)\nPETER: (just returning to the lab) Hey, Walter. Walter? (starts looking through offices as Olivia places a cell phone call)\nVOICE MESSAGING: (recording) You've reached Astrid Farnsworth. Please leave a message.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, it's Olivia. Can you call me when you get this?\nPETER: (finds what is left of the pig brain lemon cake) Whatever Walter was baking, it didn't turn out too hot. You think maybe they went out for breakfast?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nPETER: Speaking of breakfast, I put on a pot of coffee. You want a cup?\nOLIVIA: Sure. (studies the room) Here. Please, let me. (helping her shoulder-impaired soulmate with the complex task of coffee preparation)\nPETER: Yes, ma'am. (resigns) Do you want to talk about it?\nOLIVIA: Talk about what? (knowing full well what he wants to 'explore')\nPETER: The Jedi Mind Trick you pulled on me back on the roof.\nOLIVIA: I can only attribute it to Cortexiphan.\nPETER: But, Liv, suddenly you're able to do things that you were never able to do before. First, you saved Jessica, and now my shoulder.\nOLIVIA: Look, I don't know how I did it. I just did. Here you go. (hands over coffee cup)\nPETER: Liv. When Walter gets back, I'd like you to let him run some more tests.\nOLIVIA: You got it. (answers cell phone) Dunham.\nJESSICA HOLT: (exasperated) Olivia, it's Jessica Holt.\nOLIVIA: Jessica?\nJESSICA HOLT: Thank God you picked up. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn't know who else to call.\nOLIVIA: It's okay. Just calm down. Tell me what's wrong.\nJESSICA HOLT: (from a residence) I think someone's following me.\nOLIVIA: Following you?\nJESSICA HOLT: Ever since I left Harvard. Ever since I met all of you.\nOLIVIA: Okay, where are you now, Jessica?\nJESSICA HOLT: Um, I\u2019m at home. I sent Sarah to stay at her dad's flat. (a bald man stands two rooms away and listens to the concerned nanite victim)\nOLIVIA: Alright, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to lock all the doors and stay inside. We're gonna be right there.\nJESSICA HOLT: Okay. (still flustered) Thank you, Olivia.\n(as she moves away from the front door, The Observer follows her movement through the house. he stops and stays flypapered in-place when he steps onto abstract symbols embedded in the flooring)\nOLIVIA: (as they make entry in response to the worrisome call that came to the lab) Jessica? Jessica? Jessica? (notices the abandoned personnel items on a table) Her purse. Her phone and her wallet are still here.\nPETER: (finds a gaping hole in floor of the utility room) Come here and take a look at this. She mention anything else to you on the phone?\nOLIVIA: No, just that since she left us, she felt like she'd been followed.\nPETER: (worried that she is obsessing) Liv? You didn't put this woman's life in danger. You're the one that saved her.\nOLIVIA: (answers cell phone) Sir?\nBROYLES: (on speakerphone from his office) I need you to meet me at Boston General. Agent Farnsworth was just brought in with a gunshot wound.\nOLIVIA: Wait, what -- when?\nBROYLES: The only information I have is that an anonymous call was placed to 9-1-1. When the ambulance arrived, they found Agent Farnsworth.\nOLIVIA: Well, how is she?\nBROYLES: She's out of surgery and reported in stable condition.\nOLIVIA: Okay, and what about Walter?\nBROYLES: You should bring him with you.\nOLIVIA: We aren't with him. We thought that he was with Astrid.\nASTRID: (propped-up in bed. weary) Where is Walter?\nBROYLES: Right now, we don't know.\nOLIVIA: Do you remember the last time you saw him?\nASTRID: At the warehouse. We were looking for Bell. Walter thinks he's still alive.\nPETER: What warehouse?\nASTRID: By the waterfront. Where I got shot.\nBROYLES: You weren't found at the waterfront.\nOLIVIA: Well, somebody must have moved her.\nPETER: And called 9-1-1. Which means they didn't want you dead. (holds her hand)\nBROYLES: Do you know who shot you?\nASTRID: There was a crew of armed men. And they probably took Walter. (tearing with guilt) Peter, I tried to protect him, but I couldn't get him out of there.\nPETER: I know you did. You said you were by the waterfront?\nASTRID: The corner of First and Effie. Right down by the docks. And there was something going on there. We heard strange noises, animals that I didn't recognize.\nOLIVIA: (to Peter) Well, they're probably gone by now. I mean, they must have realized that, as soon as she regained consciousness, she'd tell us where she was.\nPETER: Still. Maybe we can find something. (leaves the private room)\nOLIVIA: (to Broyles) You know, BPD's got all the information on Jessica Holt.\nBROYLES: I'll let you know if we find anything.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nASTRID: (to Olivia as she leaves to follow Peter) Hey. Be careful.\nOLIVIA: (after parking almost exactly where Astrid parked the Vista Cruiser the night before, the conversation from the car continues as they walk along the now empty dockage to the A-1 Importers door) ...but even if Bell is responsible, what does infecting people with nanites and using the sun's light to ignite an oil reserve have to do with collapsing two universes to create a new one? I mean, how are they connected?\nPETER: I have absolutely no idea. Maybe Walter did. (enters the warehouse then rushes forward to meet a familiar face) What are you doing here?\nTHE OBSERVER: (standing on the missing piece of flooring from Holt's residence) I am not here of my own volition.\nJESSICA HOLT: (ingresses from hiding with her pistol leveled at the intruders) Step back from him. (to Olivia) Set down your weapon. Slowly.\nOLIVIA: (aiming right back at her) What are you doing?\nJESSICA HOLT: I'm sure many things are racing through your mind right now. But none of them are as important as what I\u2019m about to say. If you ever want to see Walter again, put down your gun.\nOLIVIA: (places her pistol on the floor and slides it fifteen feet to Jessica) You work for Bell.\nPETER: (angry. to the Observer) You're here because this is important, right? So why don't you do something?\nJESSICA HOLT: (to Peter) He can't. The Stasis Runes at his feet keep him stuck right where he is. (to The Observer) Unfortunately for you, this was a future you didn't foresee. (to Olivia) It seems he's very concerned about the events in your life. And Doctor Bell said that, if we put you in harm's way, he'd appear.\nOLIVIA: That day you were infected, that was intentional. (sees the deception) You never had a daughter.\nJESSICA HOLT: (smug) I hate kids. Now let's see how concerned you are about him. (fires pistol three times at The Observer. all three projectiles are easily caught, then discarded. to Olivia) They can operate at hyper-attenuated time. To us, it almost looks like magic. It's not, though. It's just tech that essentially lets them move very, very fast. (unholsters new pistol and aims it) Now this gun is an invention of Doctor Bell's. Shoots faster. (fires weapon and strikes The Observer, with the round passing through his palm and left shoulder. blood erupts from the injury)\nOLIVIA: Okay, what are you doing? I mean, what do you want? (as Holt prepares to fire again) Please, could you just put the gun down and talk to me?\nJESSICA HOLT: He feels no emotion. (callous and cold herself. morally indifferent) Perhaps no pain. This won't upset him. But it appears to upset you. (prepares to fire)\nOLIVIA: Damn it, stop. Just -- just tell me what it is that you want. (catches three rounds from the advanced pistol and redirects them back to their source... clipping Holt in the torso and killing her)\nOLIVIA: Here. (rushes to help the injured man) Can I stop the bleeding? Can you sit down?\nTHE OBSERVER: I cannot.\nOLIVIA: Huh?\nTHE OBSERVER: It is impossible right now.\nPETER: (on cell phone) We're in the warehouse. Hurry. (ends call) EMTs are on the way. September, what is this thing? (that has his feet trapped and zaps energy)\nTHE OBSERVER: I am surprised they knew of this methodology. It is beyond them. (after Peter retrieves a board and scrapes the symbols off of the flooring, he collapses) Oh.\nOLIVIA: Will you let me check the wound?\nPETER: Walter... Doctor Bishop. Do you know where he is?\nTHE OBSERVER: No. I do not.\nOLIVIA: At least now we know how you got shot. (greeted by an inquisitive stare) I've seen you shot before just like this. You came to me at the Opera House. You said, in every version of the future, I would have to die.\nTHE OBSERVER: I did not. Or I have not yet. I suspect I understand now. The conversation you are referring to has not yet happened for me. I must investigate the future and find out what I meant. (stands to leave) I hope... I get back to you in time. (turns and walks through an S-brane)\nOLIVIA: Well, what are we gonna do about finding Walter? Our only lead is dead.\nPETER: (moves to Holt and starts preparing her for an ambulance ride to Walter's lab) That doesn't mean we can't still question her.\nPETER: No, no, no. Not there. (as Olivia starts to inject the corpse in the arm) Right here. Right in the thinker. (taps his temple) That wasn't so bad, was it?\nNINA: (enters with back-up technicians) How long has she been dead?\nPETER: About twenty-five minutes.\nNINA: Quickly. Use the Negative Prongs first or she'll short out. Start with a trickle of DC and let it calibrate. No more. (admires the corpse) Pretty. (fires a spike from a nail gun into the corpse's temple. to Peter) There'll come a time when I\u2019ll ask you how you knew about this technology. (nails the other temple an electrical node) Maintain her body temperature at roughly eighty-five degrees.\nPETER: I'll get the ice packs.\nNINA: (to a concerned Olivia) If she knows anything about what happened to Walter, I assure you we will too.\nOLIVIA: Well, she took a chance on dying at that office building for whatever her mission is. She was counting on me to save her. They used Jessica to play on my sympathies, and then they used my feelings for Peter, my fear that Jones would kill him.\nNINA: William always talked a lot about the powers Cortexiphan children might have.\nOLIVIA: But why is he activating me now? Why is he doing this?\nNINA: (maternal pride) My Dear... you may have a different set of memories now, But, at heart, you're still the same girl I knew. You've always had incredible compassion. It was your capacity for feeling that made William and Walter so sure that you were the perfect candidate for The Trials. And I don't know what it is, but William must want -- no, he needs something from you. Something only you can provide.\n(underway on the open seas in the bright midday sun. old friends converse in the admiral's lounge)\nWALTER: Why, William? Why would you do this? What could you possibly hope to gain by destroying both universes?\nWILLIAM BELL: Walter, this was all your idea. Peter died -- twice. You hated God. \"What kind of God would cause so much suffering?\" That's what you said. So much pain. You decided to create a universe that would operate by your rules. And then, when you realized that you were smart enough to do it, you got scared. You asked me to cut out a portion of your brain.\nWALTER: No.\nWILLIAM BELL: Yes, Walter. We cut those ideas out of your head to literally put 'the Genie' back into the bottle. Then I grew older. I grew cynical. I grew cancer. Then I realized that dosing myself with Cortexiphan would slow it down. But slowing is not stopping. For me, it's just a matter of time. The clock is ticking. Tick, tick, tick, tick. And that's when it occurred to me. You were right, Walter. Walter, you were right, right, right. Every rant you ever went on made perfect sense. Suddenly, I understood not just you - but everything. (profound reflection) God made us in his image. If that is so, if we are capable of being Gods, then it is our destiny to do so.\nWALTER: No. No, William.\nWILLIAM BELL: My dear friend, even if you deny it now, you have always been playing God. - - I am.\nPETER: (hailing Nina and Olivia from their private conversation on the other side of the lab) Guys, we're ready. (throws the electrical switch on the freshly dead Holt) Jessica, can you hear my voice?\nJESSICA HOLT: (almost entirely motionless, her eyes manage to rotate and blink independent of one another) I can't -- I can't feel my arms. Can't feel my legs. Oh, my God. (panic sets-in) Why can't I feel anything?\nPETER: (demanding) Where is Walter?\nJESSICA HOLT: What did you do to me? (drifts from her temporary awareness)\nPETER: What just happened there? Did she faint?\nNINA: No, no, that's not possible. She's not alive. She can't faint.\nJESSICA HOLT: (regains awareness. chameleon eyes return. incoherent train-of-memories) Mum? Mummy? Mummy. Where are you, Mummy? Mummy, where are you?\nOLIVIA: Jessica, we need you to tell us where William Bell is.\nJESSICA HOLT: (concentration drifts back to childhood) Ding, ding, ding. My bicycle. My bicycle is blue and has a little chimey bell on it. Ding, ding, ding. My bicycle is blue and has a little chimey bell. I left it in the rain, and it rusted.\nNINA: (miffed) Jessica! Jessica, look at me. William Bell. Where is he?\nJESSICA HOLT: Mm-hmm. He's all wet I expect. (cryptic) And a bore. \u266aA man must be blind or be out of his mind to go out to sea once more.\u266a\nPETER: (decrypts the message for the group) He's on a boat. It's probably close to where he shot Astrid. This is taking too long. (to the corpse) Jessica! Is William Bell on a boat?\nJESSICA HOLT: (suddenly focused) William Bell is a great man. A brilliant man. But not just a man. (ideologue) Birth to a new world born of the collapse.\nOLIVIA: Jessica, how is he going to give birth to a new world if we closed the bridge between the two universes?\nJESSICA HOLT: (checks the monitor and notes the electrical stimuli in Holt fading rapidly) I'm afraid we don't have much longer.\nOLIVIA: (adamant) How is he going to collapse the two universes?\nJESSICA HOLT: (wonky eyes. coy smile) He needed an energy source.\nOLIVIA: What energy source?\nJESSICA HOLT: We're all expendable in the wake of creation.\nOLIVIA: Jessica, how is he going to do it?\nJESSICA HOLT: (rhetoric) Noah was a righteous man, and he brought onto The Ark every creature to populate the new world. Two by two.\nOLIVIA: (peeved. grabs the corpse by the shoulder) Damn it, Jessica, what energy source? (unintentionally short circuits the electrical fusing in the lab... and the electrically re-animated corpse)\nOLIVIA: What... what just happened? (amid the acrid waft on fried components) Did I just do that?\nNINA: Does Walter have a Gauss Meter?\nPETER: Yeah. (starts to look for it)\nNINA: I think I know what's happening here.\nOLIVIA: The new energy source? It's me. Bell's going to try and use me to collapse the two universes. That's why he's been activating me.\nNINA: (after scanning Olivia with the Gauss Meter) The ElectroMagnetic energy you're giving off is extraordinary. But, if William is using the energy you're generating, I believe I may know how to find him.\nAGENT #1: (to Broyles, as he arrives and joins what is left of his science task force) A general cargo freighter left Boston Harbor at Ten Twenty-two this morning... the Talos. It fell off radar fifteen minutes later.\nPETER: That's six hours ago. It could be two hundred miles off the coast by now.\nBROYLES: (to Nina, specifically) Talk to me.\nNINA: It's not good. Olivia is giving off an exceedingly strong and specific ElectroMagnetic field. Now I know how it sounds, but I believe she was activated to power the universe collapse.\nOLIVIA: Lucky me. (mock enthusiasm)\nBROYLES: And I assume... you can't turn her off.\nNINA: No. But we can use her to find Walter and William Bell. The frequency at which Olivia is resonating will also be the frequency at the epicenter of the dimensional intersection, meaning we should be able to identify the exact location where the two universes are overlapping. Now, assuming Bell wants to survive the collapse, that's where he'll be. The 'calm at the center of the storm', as it were.\nBROYLES: And how long will it take?\nNINA: The satellites are almost online.\nBROYLES: We'll find Bell.\nTECHNICIAN: We've got NavStar. (as global graphics of the Western Hemisphere fill the large display screens)\nNINA: Task the satellites at 392.6 hertz.\nAGENT #2: (holding the phone at his workstation) National Weather Service is reporting a squall approximately eighty miles offshore - due East of Boston.\nAGENT #3: (from his monitoring position) Three microquakes -- Albany, New York, Waterville, Vermont, and Worcester, Massachusetts, all within seconds of each other.\nNINA: (growing worried) It's started. The universes are colliding.\nBROYLES: (to his harried staff) Narrow your search to the area of the storm.\nOLIVIA: (sitting and reflecting when she is joined by her favorite guy) Did you find Bell?\nPETER: (enters and joins her) Not yet.\nOLIVIA: I wonder what he has in store for me now.\nPETER: (sits and delivers a 'who-loves-you?' pep-talk) It's gonna be okay.\nOLIVIA: You know, for the first time, I don't think that it is. I remember being in that lab in Jacksonville when Walter and William were doing the Cortexiphan Trials. (visualizing her childhood) I remember how it smelled, how I felt, how scared I was, how all alone I was. And now, you know, years later, nothing's changed. I'm still that little girl, and William Bell is still doing experiments on me. I'm just still being used.\nPETER: No. Something has changed. This time, you're not alone. (a comforting hug promises a safe outcome)\nWILLIAM BELL: (scanning the horizon through the porthole) You have to see this. Oh, don't look like that. If nothing else, for pure scientific curiosity. Trust me. (demonstrative) You've never seen anything like this. It's marvelous.\nWALTER: (abandons display case with pistol for porthole observation with Bell. astounded at the coalescing maritime environments) How?\nWILLIAM BELL: Olivia. You were right, Walter. She truly is a remarkable girl. (as the forces of nature from two universes begin to encircle the tramp steamer)\nTECHNICIAN: (announces, once satellite coverage highlights the overlapping frequency and null zone between universes) Got it. Eighty-four miles due East of Nantucket.\nBROYLES: (to aide) Call upstairs. Tell them we need choppers. (to Olivia and Peter) Get suited-up.\nWALTER: William, William... please. Don't do this.\nWILLIAM BELL: You may be sad now, Walter, you may be frightened, but you'll see. (growing irritated) We deserve this.\nWALTER: (quietly. disappointed) No.\nHELICOPTER PILOT: (on headset to his passengers as his three-ship of light utility helicopters arrive on target at \u2248500'ASL) These are the coordinates, ma'am, but I've got no visual.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, it's not here. Can you check the uplink? Maybe they're jamming us.\nPETER: Are you kidding me? It's right there. (points to left ten o'clock low position)\nOLIVIA: I don't see anything.\nPETER: Nina?\nNINA: (baffled) No, nothing.\nPETER: Am I losing my mind here?\nHELICOPTER PILOT: Still no visual contact, sir.\nNINA: (rationalizing) No, I think I know what's happening. If William is trying to collapse the universes, it stands to reason that the fabric between the universes is growing thin here where his ship is.\nOLIVIA: But there's nothing here.\nNINA: No, not in this here. The ship has already phased entirely out of sync with our universe. No one here can see it, but Peter...\nPETER: ...I\u2019m from the other side, so I resonate at a different frequency.\nNINA: Yes, from the other side, the ship is visible. For how much longer, we can't be sure.\nPETER: But if it's already crossed over into the other universe, there's no way for us to get to it. Even if we had the time, the bridge is closed.\nOLIVIA: There is a way. Me.\nNINA: Yes, Olivia now has as much activated Cortexiphan in her system as the Olivia from the original timeline. Now, if what you both have told me is accurate, Olivia can jump between worlds. You, Peter, you can see it. Olivia, you can reach it. But it will have to be done together.\nOLIVIA: What if I can't do it?\nNINA: You have the most extraordinary gifts, but the only one you were denied was knowing it. You've had the power all along.\nPETER: Are you ready? (opens the left cargo door after she nods in the affirmative)\nOLIVIA: Alright. If you've lost your mind, now would be the time to tell me.\nPETER: (yells back in to the pilot) Take it to Port about three yards. (to Olivia) Now! (they fall towards the ocean surface, then fall through the brane into the alternate universe and onto Bells' freighter. Peter nearly bounces overboard with his damaged shoulder still limited by a sling. Olivia manages to grab his good arm and help haul to safety) It worked.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, are you surprised?\nPETER: Yeah. (removes a pistol from his jacket) It was the pilot's. You can't be the only one who always gets to carry a gun.\nOLIVIA: (looks at the menagerie below decks) What is this place?\nPETER: I think this is his Ark.\nWILLIAM BELL: (pontificating in his stateroom) \"I will arise and go, now, and go to Innisfree, and a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made. (reciting with his eyes closed as Walter examines and loads a .41 cal Luger from a display case) Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee, and live alone in the bee loud glade.\" Do you know it, Walter?\nWALTER: Yeats. (just as Peter and Olivia make armed entry into the state room)\nOLIVIA: Walter, are you alright?\nWILLIAM BELL: Well, this is unexpected. You know I was not planning on having any humans. What a troublesome species we can be, after all. I had assumed that Walter and I would die off and my new universe would thrive unencumbered by the savage whims of Mankind. But I see I was wrong - look at the two of you. Humans abide. They persevere. They survive. You have earned your right in the new order, a final breeding pair. Amongst all others, you will be the new Adam and Eve.\nPETER: Stop this. Turn it off now.\nWILLIAM BELL: Shoot me if you like, young Peter. I cannot turn it off. There's no escaping the inevitable. The chain reaction has begun. Olivia is a living uncertainty engine. Every breath she takes brings us closer to Nirvana. Every beat of her heart tears the world from its hinges. She is 'The Redeemer. Go ahead. I will not be the first God to be martyred for creation.\nWALTER: Forgive me. (shoots Olivia in the forehead)\nPETER: No! (rushes to his fatally wounded soulmate) No! (the vessel re-syncs with this universe and the helicopters remain directly on target) No. No. (to Walter) You killed her.\nWILLIAM BELL: (to Peter) Yes, indeed, he did. (to Walter) Very clever, old friend. If that's what you consider learning a lesson from the past (rings his ship's bell)... you paid a steep price. (as he phases from sight. evaporating into the ether) We could have all been so happy together.\nPETER: (distraught) You killed her.\nPETER: (trying to cradle his corpse of a girlfriend in his arms. seriously miffed) Don't touch her.\nWALTER: Peter, this is no time for emotions. Time is of the essence. We have to move rapidly if we're going to save her.\nPETER: Save her? She's dead.\nWALTER: (all business) You know very well that hasn't always stopped me. Peter! Listen to me! (slaps his cheek to gain his attention) Now, go over there to the table, get the letter opener, and clear everything else off the desk. Do it now, Peter. (Peter starts his tasks as Walter preps Olivia for combat surgery) Her brain is currently saturated with Cortexiphan. The brain tissue is regenerative, so, if I can get the bullet out before the Cortexiphan wears off and the non-regenerative tissue calcifies, I'll be able to save her. It's like my lemon cake.\nPETER: Whoa. Whoa. (as Walter begins to carve into the back of her brain stem with the letter opener) Stop. What are you doing?\nWALTER: I need an exit wound. There isn't one. (goes bullet fishing in the front of her skull with a briefing pointer)\nPETER: How much time do we have, Walter?\nWALTER: Not long. Any damage I do should repair itself... if I can get the bullet out. I'm so sorry, Olive. (drives the slug out of the freshly carved exit wound in the back of her head with a sharp rap on the pointer)\nPETER: (despondent at the questionable results) Walter?\nWALTER: (as Olivia's vital signs return) It worked.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: (sitting in office with his guest) Despite full international cooperation, there remains no sign of William Bell. The biological materials from Doctor Bell's Ark have been cryogenically quarantined for future study. Your team will of course have full access if you so desire.\nBROYLES: Thank you.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: The committee would like to acknowledge the work you and your team have done in protecting the welfare of the people of this nation and the world. As such, we would like to grant your request for significant funding to upgrade your operational and scientific divisions. And thank you, Phillip, for keeping us all safe at night.\nBROYLES: You're welcome, Sir.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Well, that will be all... General Broyles.\nBROYLES: It's Colonel, sir.\nSENATOR VAN HORN: Not anymore. (proud handshake) Congratulations, General. You've earned it.\n(outside. after the promotion)\nNINA: How'd it go?\nBROYLES: Better than expected. Fringe Division now finds itself with a fully-funded Science Division and no one to run it. Nina... you want a job? (the offer makes her giddy)\nWALTER: (sitting and waiting for information on Olivia's condition) You know, Peter, I\u2019ve been thinking. Due to the intense energy utilization, Cortexiphan levels in the body should be almost negligible.\nPETER: Meaning what, Walter?\nWALTER: Well, meaning that she won't be able to run around setting things on fire or doing superhuman things. Excuse me, Miss. Is that Lemon Jell-o?\nORDERLY: These are urine samples.\nWALTER: Oh, well, in that case, no, thank you. I'm more peckish than thirsty.\nPETER: So you're saying Olivia's normal now?\nWALTER: Well, the treatments did leave a biological signature, so I suppose some abilities could one day emerge, but, for all intents and purposes, yes, I believe she may be.\nASTRID: (leaves her room to join her colleagues) Is she out yet?\nPETER: (shakes head no) How you holding up?\nDOCTOR: She's all done. She's ready to go home. (Peter relocates to Olivia's room)\n(Astrid parks in the warm seat Peter left behind and unsheathes a quiver of red licorice whips for both of them to share)\nWALTER: (gladly accepts the tasty treat) Thank you, Astrid. (curious as to her whimsical stare) What?\nASTRID: You just called me by my real name.\nWALTER: Did I?\nPETER: I found one. (enters her room as she finishes dressing. plops down the real estate section of the newspaper) It's perfect. Brookline. Center Hall. Two stories.\nOLIVIA: Peter...\nPETER: I just figured, after everything that we've been through in the last couple of days... well Hell, the last couple of years... I thought we deserved a little bit of normal.\nOLIVIA: It's... it's perfect.\nPETER: I suppose that he was right. The Observer. That in every version of the future, you had to die. But I never want to lose you again. (after an extended hug) What? (foreboding) You're okay, right? I mean, the doctor didn't tell you anything else.\nOLIVIA: Actually, he did.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: Peter, I\u2019m pregnant.\n(Walter and Astrid stand in the doorway, admiring the couple after having caught the tail-end of the announcement)\n(delighted at the news, Walter bounces around the lab later that night in his comfy clothes, whistling a lullaby and prepping peanut butter and jelly on toast. his tone changes when an unannounced guest appears a few feet away)\nWALTER: I don't suppose you're here for a sandwich.\nTHE OBSERVER: We have to warn the others. They are coming.\nWALTER: Who's coming?"

    "Script":"1 Prologue 2 ACT II Henrietta's Apartment - Liberating Olivia 3 Act III Napean Building - Interrogation Intensified 4 Act IV Napean Building - Clearing Security 5 ACT V\n(In a sunny urban park on an idyllic day, a young girl picks a dandelion and blows the seed pods into the wind. nearby, her parents, Peter and Olivia lay in the grass and watch with stoic delight as their progeny plays and explores. without warning, a bright flash above the downtown skyline sends those in the park into a panic and running for safety. the young girl seems unaware of the pending danger as Observers begin stepping into this dimension from thin air. Peter rushes to grab his daughter... then regains his awareness searching a triage tent for...)\nPETER: Olivia. Olivia!\nTRIAGE NURSE: It's okay. She's just resting.\nPETER: And where's my little girl?\nTRIAGE NURSE: No children were brought in.\nPETER: She was with us. Where are they keeping the kids? \u2018Etta! \u2018Etta! (Peter bolts awake from his nightmare in a panic. it's early morning in his daughter's apartment and he has spent the night on her couch. the invasion events from decades earlier haunt his dreams. as Walter slumbers on an adjacent couch, Peter decides to quickly check on his fully grown daughter)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Dad? You alright? (as he sneaks a look into her bedroom as she rises)\nPETER: Yeah, I'm alright. I was just checking up on you. (leaves the bedroom) (Henrietta recovers her necklace with the spent bullet from the bedding then leans back to reflect. Walter stirs from his sleep and checks out the window. 2036 is still as bleak as when he went to sleep the night before)\nPETER: (to Astrid as she sits in the kitchen playing a holographic board game) What time is it?\nASTRID: It's around seven. I made some tea. And I found these in the fridge. They're called Egg Sticks.\nPETER: My gawd. (holds up what looks like a pasty white 'Slim Jim') What is that -- punishment food?\nASTRID: (sardonic) Welcome to 2036.\nCOMPUTER GAME: The word 'naugahyde' not found.\nASTRID: Naugahyde was a very popular premium pleather. American patents...\nWALTER: Peter, you let me oversleep. We should be on our way by now to find Olivia.\nPETER: (to the man in boxer shorts) Nobody wants to find Olivia more than I do, but you're gonna need some pants, Walter.\nWALTER: (grumpy) I'm aware I'm not wearing pants, Peter. I'm not an idiot. The last time I spoke to her, she was in that location -- Columbus Circle, 2015.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (joining the group. dressed to go) She was in New York?\nWALTER: She called me the day she disappeared. I could hardly hear her. The line went dead.\nPETER: Do you understand that conversation was twenty-one years ago? She could be anywhere now, in this city or not.\nWALTER: She had a piece of the puzzle... a crucial piece. (activates the holographic blueprint for the anti-Observer device) This is just one part. What I sent her to get will unlock the whole.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Unlock the whole what?\nWALTER: Plan to defeat the Observers, of course. September and I worked on the plan he provided in a unique way. After we completed each component, the information was scrambled in my mind as a precaution against being read. He told me that when the time came to implement the plan, I had to retrieve something from Grand Central Station, and that then all would be clear. And that's what I sent Olivia to get. She was on her way back when she vanished. She never returned. A few days later, I Ambered us. (gobbles down a mouthful of the breakfast staple) Good gawd. (spits it out) What's that?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's an Egg Stick.\nWALTER: What a miserable future. Aspen, help me find my shoes. There's no time to waste.\nPETER: (privately to his daughter) We have to believe she's still alive. I know you're doubting that right now.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: How could you know that?\nPETER: 'Cause how could she be, after all these years? What are the odds of getting all of us back? If she's still alive, Henrietta, we're gonna find her. Columbus Circle - Amber Clues\nWALTER: So this is what's left of Columbus Circle. A travesty... a travesty.\nPETER: What did they do to the park?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: They paved it to build machines that pump carbon monoxide into the atmosphere.\nASTRID: Why?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: There's one on every continent. The air here, it's too oxygen-rich for them. A few more years, and the effects will be irreversible. It'll reduce the average non-Observer lifespan to somewhere around 45.\nWALTER: Well, somewhere around here she called me. She was running. That much I could ascertain, and then the connection was suddenly cut.\nASTRID: Walter.\nWALTER: Yes, Olivia could be trapped in there. We had already discussed the possibility of using Amber as a last resort should we be at risk of being caught by the Observers. I'd already given her an Ambering device. I would have given one to you too if you hadn't abandoned us.\nASTRID: (scolding)\nWalter. (gently to Peter) He didn't mean it.\nPETER: Sure he did.\nWALTER: Oh, no.\nASTRID: What are all those holes? Everyone's gone.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Fourth Gen Amber removal -- they were taken recently.\nPETER: So the Observers have Olivia?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: No. Amber Gypsies.\nWALTER: What on Earth are Amber Gypsies? Act I Gypsy Town - Black Marketing\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: The black market thrives here.\nWALTER: (to a silent Geisha as she sits and rocks) Hello, there. I fell in love in Japan once. I almost married her.\nPETER: Come on, Walter.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Okay, go down three halls -- the first area on your right.\nPETER: You're not coming?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Fringe Division shakes these guys down all the time. Someone will recognize me.\\\nPETER: Walnuts?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Deal closer. That's almost $3,000. If they tell you any different, they're trying to rip you off.\nPETER: Excuse me. We're looking for someone who was cut out of Amber not far from here. We're not loyalists... just concerned family members.\nAMBER GYPSY: Freshest cuts are on the left.\nWALTER: I still can't believe my eyes -- what you've grown into. Of course, you must understand for me it's only two months ago that I took you to the pier. You loved the horses.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Carousel.\nWALTER: You remember?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: No. I wish I did. It's just what they call them, right -- carousels? They used to anyway.\nWALTER: To me, you will forever be a little girl.\nPETER: The woman I'm looking for -- she's a blonde.\nAMBER GYPSY: So's my sister. Those are the cuts.\nPETER: This one would be hard to forget.\nAMBER GYPSY: Yeah. Information's expensive.\nPETER: She would have had an electronic device in her hand.\nAMBER GYPSY: Huh. Late twenties, black leather jacket?\nASTRID: Yeah.\nAMBER GYPSY: She was sold.\nPETER: She was sold? Sold to who? Markham's Apartment - Recovering Olivia TELEVISION: (a 70 year-old western) Your stage is waiting for you, Maverick. You selling tickets? No, but you're buying one. I am? Yes, indeed. You being an understanding soul. And one that don't like violence. Let's get out of here, Maverick. You don't want any trouble. You're right, Doc, not that kind.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: (responding to his front doorbell) This apartment is Sanctioned. I have invoked Native Rights Statute 23-D. Go away.\nPETER: Markham?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Markham is dead. (racks his shotgun) He died a hero's death. People were sad. He gave his life saving a bus full of small children and -- (after Peter breaks the door open and relieves the mighty warrior of his weapon) you're alive.\nPETER: Where is she?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: All of you.\nPETER: Where is she?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Why haven't you aged? How did you not age?\nPETER: We know you bought her.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: I love her... from the first time she came into my bookstore. I never meant her any harm.\nPETER: How'd you get her in here? You had to use a dolly or something.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: It's not supposed to happen this way. She's supposed to wake up and see me as her savior, when I figure out exactly how to wake her up.\nASTRID: A gurney. Peter, here.\nWALTER: This place is a treasure trove of literature.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: She's supposed to overlook my height issue and realize that I'm really good for her and that I love her. I have gone into substantial debt over this. Gypsy Town - Ratted out\nLOYALIST HOTLINE: You have something to report?\nAMBER GYPSY: I got some information to sell.\nLOYALIST HOTLINE: Is it Level Four?\nAMBER GYPSY: Yeah, it's good. Some people I saw on Reward Wire. I want three times the vouchers for my loyalty.\nLOYALIST HOTLINE: Proceed. Markham's Apartment - Losing Walter\nPETER: What's taking Walter so long? I want to get her out of here.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I'll go check.\nWALTER: Isaac Asimov. May I?\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Who cares?\nWALTER: I tried my hand at science-fiction writing once. Once.\nNEO-OBSERVER: Resistance is futile.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I feel like I\u2019ve heard that before. (shoots the intruder) Walter, run.\nEDWARD MARKHAM: Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.\nPETER: \u2018Etta. Are you okay?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I'm okay. I'm okay.\nPETER: Where's Walter?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: He should be here.\nPETER: Go. go, go.\nASTRID: (as the leaves the area with Olivia's encasement) What are we gonna do about Walter?\nLOYALIST ENFORCER: (as Walter flees through the halls of the building) Don't move!\nPETER: Okay. You ready? Three. Two. One. Olivia. Olivia. Breathe - breathe. You're okay. You're okay. Breathe Olivia - breathe. Breathe. There you go.\nOLIVIA: Oh, Peter. Where am I?\nPETER: You're in the year 2036.\nOLIVIA: I Ambered myself.\nPETER: I know you did. We all did. I found her. More to the point, she found us. Olivia, I want you to meet 'Etta. Kiddo, come meet your Mom.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Hi, Mama.\nOLIVIA: You're beautiful.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: So are you.\nOLIVIA: The last time I saw you, you were three years old.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: All this time I thought I was four.\nOLIVIA: No, you were three years, one month, and five days. There was not one moment that I didn't think about you. Where's Walter?\nPETER: He was captured this morning.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: By Observers.\nPETER: Walter had worked out a plan to defeat the Observers -- one that he worked out with September. He said that you had something he needed, something you were gonna give him.\nOLIVIA: From Grand Central Station. Here.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What is it?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. I was on my way to Walter when I triggered the Ambering device. So where did they take Walter?\nPETER: We're working on that. Napean Building - Interrogation Begins\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: We have been looking for you... and your friends. I am very interested in you. I don't know why you're alive. Ah, you're trying to think of music. You miss music.\nWALTER: There's not a lot of it here.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: We tolerate it. But it's merely tones, rhythms, and harmonic vibrations. I don't understand.\nWALTER: Mostly it amazes me. Music helps you shift perspective, to see things differently if you need to.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: See things? Like hope?\nWALTER: Yeah. Very much like that.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: But there is no hope... for you. Nothing grows from scorched Earth. You seem much more interesting as a human being - than as a vegetable. But, quite frankly, all things being equal, I don't mind which one you end up. The choice is yours. The Bronx - Resistance Central\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (to her parents outside the entrance) Wait here. Anil?\nANIL: 'Etta.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What happened?\nANIL: Elias was shot this afternoon coming out of The Square.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I need your help.\nOLIVIA: We didn't save the world.\nPETER: Not even by half. She's still trying, though. How long do you think it's been since they made one of these? 'cause I could sure use one right now. I never thought I'd see you again, Olivia. I know what you thought of me... when I wouldn't leave Boston to come to New York with you... when I left you alone.\nOLIVIA: No, Peter, we lost our child. And... in the grief, we just... weren't able or were incapable of -- of being what we needed to be for each other. And that was all it was.\nPETER: You were stronger than me. You could do something that I couldn't do. You saw that the world needed us, and you went to help. And I just -- I didn't have the will to give up searching for this -- this perfect little soul that we made. Out here for all these years... fighting for these people, defending them. And at the moment that she needed her father to protect her, I couldn't do it. And I wanted more than anything for that not to be true. And in the state-of-mind that I was in... that meant at all costs... including us.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Come with me. (once inside) This is Anil.\nANIL: It's an honor to meet you. What we have here is a Transilience Thought Unifier, Model-11.\nPETER: So what's it do? Turn it on. Can we access its information?\nANIL: No, that's not how it works. It accesses your information.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean?\nANIL: It retrieves specifically marked thoughts in your mind and unifies them.\nASTRID: For what purpose?\nPETER: To keep them hidden from prying eyes until you want to access them.\nANIL: Exactly. But it doesn't seem to work any longer.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: That's what Walter meant. \"all become clear\" when he gets this.\nPETER: It has to be the plan. It was fragmented and hidden on Walter's hard drive by September.\nASTRID: You guys. We found Walter.\nANIL: This is from across the street from where Doctor Bishop was taken. We'll track him with traffic cameras. This is two blocks from here.\nASTRID: Can you do that across the entire city?\nANIL: I haven't lost many people doing this, but I have lost some, so no promises.\nPETER: This thing is crucial to Walter's plan. But it is conceivable he could give them that information.\nKLOPINSKI: If he hasn't already. And who's to say what else? Does he know you're a Fringe Agent?\nNapean Building - Brain Squeeze\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Who freed you and your team from the Amber? Why did they free you? What do they expect to get from you? You're partitioned. Someone gave you information out of sequence. They did this on purpose... to protect something.\nWALTER: Aaah!\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: How did you learn to fragment your thoughts like that? Was it an Observer, as you call us, who partitioned you? No one else would know how to do that. The ideas are disparate but part of a whole. Put them together for me, please. Put them together for me. What plan? To defeat us? What are the elements of this plan? Let me organize them for you, please. You are fighting much more than I would have thought possible. Walter Bishop, if only I had a Unifier, I could unify these thoughts. I could go through the trouble to get one, But it would take weeks to break the biology key specific to your encryption. But... that doesn't mean I will not get the information out. It will make it harder to get to it, but it will come out. Who's the little girl? Who's the little blonde girl? She's helping you -- the little blonde girl. How can this small child be helping you? What is her name?\nThe Bronx - Resistance Support\nOLIVIA: She's amazing,\nPeter. There's just so many things that I want to tell her and so many things that I want to ask her.\nPETER: You will. It's like living this beautiful dream... inside of a horrible nightmare.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Got him. That's the Napean Building. They took it over a couple years ago. It had to be that one.\nPETER: Anyone ever gotten in there?\nANIL: No, but...\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What?\nANIL: We've been working on this tech.\nKLOPINSKI: Anil, it's not perfected yet. But it could work.\nPETER: So what is it?\nANIL: It's tech which will make our bodies appear dead -- impossible for the baldies to detect any life force.\nKLOPINSKI: But we've been saving it, because after we use it once, they know we'll have it.\nPETER: Sort of like reusing the Trojan Horse.\nKLOPINSKI: We could kill hundreds of them with this tactic. We could get in anywhere, including their Headquarters. Why save one man with this?\nOLIVIA: The future.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I believe that whatever his plan is to defeat the Observers, it will work. Please.\nANIL: Killing our enemies is one thing. Saving the world is another. Okay. let's do this. Come with me. Napean Building - Breaching Security\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Windmark wanted the bodies of these Resistance fighters brought in.\nFRIENDLY GUARD: I was wondering where you've been. It's always brighter when you're here.\nFRIENDLY GUARD: You hear what happened?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What?\nFRIENDLY GUARD: I was raised to Level Six. Did I tell you?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: That's great.\nFRIENDLY GUARD: Hey, if I share something, you promise you won't tell?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Yeah.\nFRIENDLY GUARD: They found Agent Foster in Amber. Your superior was a double agent. He was working with the Resistance. He was with someone named William Bell.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What did they do with him?\nFRIENDLY GUARD: That's above my pay grade. Ask Windmark yourself. He'll certainly want to talk to you about it. Napean Building - Interrogation Continued\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: These physics in your mind, they are also above your comprehension. What are the stones utilized for?\nWALTER: I don't...\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You must try. What are the stones? What is your plan to defeat us? Let down the walls. I am your ally. Napean Building - Morgue Delivery\nSECURITY ESCORT: Nice watch. And I want his boots too.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Hey.\nPETER: What happened to him?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Occupational hazard.\nPETER: That's my girl.\nOLIVIA: What, they need this to breathe?\nPETER: Apparently. This one's only temporary. They're building a more permanent one in Central Park. They don't like clean air. Alright, it's always the red wire. Unless it's the white wire. That did it. Let's go. Napean Building - Interrogation Termination\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Clearly, we are done here. I must say, your brain will make an excellent specimen.\nSAFETY KLAXON: Air control malfunction. Air control malfunction. Air control malfunction.\nPETER: Walter.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nSAFETY KLAXON: Air control malfunction.\nPETER: Walter.\nOLIVIA: Is he okay?\nPETER: I don't know.\nSAFETY KLAXON: Air control malfunction. Air control malfunction. Air control malfunction. Air control malfunction.\nOLIVIA: Over here. Peter.\nPURSUER: To the front gate! ASTRID: Oh, my gawd, Walter.\nWALTER: Afro... do you have any music?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: (later. reviewing Henrietta on his holographic security recording) Hello, little girl.\nHenrietta's Apartment - Failed Plan\nWALTER: Olivia. I am so happy you're alive.\nPETER: Walter, do you recognize this? It's what September wanted you to find. It's called a Thought Unifier. Or at least it was. This one's long since dead. He must have designed it specifically for you.\nWALTER: What's it used for?\nOLIVIA: Well, it's meant to collect and make sense of the scrambled plan that September put in your mind.\nWALTER: What plan?\nPETER: You told us that you knew all the parts of the plan, all the elements. You just weren't sure what they were supposed to be used for.\nASTRID: Walter, do you remember this?\nWALTER: Whose hand is that?\nASTRID: It's William Bell's hand.\nWALTER: You're out of your mind. Why would we have William Bell's hand?\nASTRID: You said we needed his handprint so we could get access to one of his storage facilities.\nWALTER: I don't remember it. I don't remember any of it. I've failed myself, and I\u2019ve failed the world. What is wrong with me? What has happened to --\nOLIVIA: -- Walter.\nWALTER: I can't do it. I can't even recognize myself.\nOLIVIA: It's like there's nothing left to unify. All the parts are gone.\nASTRID: Or they took them.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's more likely they were destroyed when he was fighting it.\nOLIVIA: Will they ever heal?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: No. The plan is gone."

Come on, Kiddo. It's time to go home.\nCROWD PANIC: Come on! Stay in the car, right now! We gotta go - - grab her! Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Grab her for me!\nPETER: \u2018Etta! \u2018Etta, come here now! I got her!\nCROWD PANIC: Over there! Come on! Stay in the car! Right now!\nOLIVIA: What happened?\nMEDIC: You were caught in a blast. You're safe now.\nPETER: She was a... little girl.\nOLIVIA: Peter?\nTRIAGE NURSE: I'm sorry. No children were brought in.\nPETER: That can't be right. She was standing right in front of me.\nTRIAGE NURSE: People are lost all over the city.\nPETER: She's around here someplace. Where are they taking the kids? \u2018Etta!\nOLIVIA: Peter!\nPETER: \u2018Etta!\n(Olivia jolts awake from the nightmare she was envisioning)\nPETER: You're okay. You were dreaming about her? You said her name.\nOLIVIA: I'm still trembling.\nPETER: For us, it's like it all just happened a couple of months ago. But it didn't. She's here, and we're here. We're okay now.\n(joins the group gathered around Walter and the TTU interface)\nPETER: Good morning.\nASTRID: Not for Walter. Something's wrong.\nPETER: Why? What's up?\nWALTER: Not the thing working can't it's not.\nASTRID: The Thought Unifier's having adverse effects. He's talking out of sequence.\nWALTER: Two hours ago the Christmas Tree Macy's Sale to have a nap.\nPETER: Get that thing off of him.\nASTRID: Okay.\nWALTER: I'm not an amateur, Peter. I need this contraption if I am to retrieve the plan to defeat the Observers from the depths of my memory.\nPETER: We don't know if there's anything left to retrieve - and - we don't know what that thing is doing to you.\n(as Walter utters a few Scandinavian phrases)\nPETER: Swedish?\nASTRID: He was speaking Portuguese earlier.\nOLIVIA: (joins the group) Good morning.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I hope the floor wasn't too bad.\nOLIVIA: Oh, no, I slept well. Thank you. Thanks. So how's it coming?\nPETER: So far we know that, at some point in the past, Walter knew both Portuguese and Swedish. Other than that, nothing.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you've always documented things. So are you absolutely sure that you didn't write anything down?\nWALTER: I can't remember, but anything's possible.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Even if there were files, you can't go back to Harvard. We can't get in.\nPETER: Why not?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It was taken over by Observers five years ago. Some kind of base or... no one knows exactly. The entire four-mile radius is a No-Go Zone.\nWALTER: What's wrong? Why can't we get into Harvard?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's been taken over by Observers, Walter.\nWALTER: Well, that's not a problem for someone who's done acid.\nOLIVIA: So are these barriers around Walter's Lab checkpoints?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Yeah. No one gets in without paperwork.\nWALTER: Tunnels.\nPETER: We don't have time to dig tunnels, Walter, or the manpower.\nWALTER: We don't have to dig them. They're already there. Steam tunnels.\nWALTER: Right beneath us, two and a quarter miles of tunnels that house the steam pipes that heat Harvard. They stretch from the Cambridge Electric Company plant on Western Avenue, to Soldiers Field, to the Law School, to the science labs. They made sure the entrances were well-hidden. Few have seen the mysterious passageways. (steps and hears a hollow metallic sound under the soil and overgrowth) Peter. (after clearing the debris, lifts and opens the access door to find a metal ladder down to the tunnels) Yahtzee.\nSECURITY: (above ground. Observers make there way around the 'privatized' Harvard campus) Your papers are in order. Please proceed.\nWALTER: (as the team makes its' way through the steam tunnels to the Kresge Building and Walter's Lab) The temperature in the tunnels usually hovers around one hundred degrees, sometimes as high as one-twenty. You might want to take that coat off, Dear. Sometimes Belly and I would wear swim trunks and Speedos.\nASTRID: What was that?\nWALTER: Quick, out of the way! (spots an artistic drawing of a dragon on the wall) Hey. I've been looking for you. This way. (after he knocks open a grating vent and the team climbs through. they cross the hall into his dark and dusty lab) Oh, my. (looks and the glowing golden mass that covers a quarter of his lab) I must have Ambered it.\nPETER: Why?\nWALTER: To protect it, I imagine.\nOLIVIA: What is it?\nWALTER: It's my BetaMax recorder on a tripod. Look where it's standing. Look at the blast pattern. This is the Amber point of origin. I must have been standing right here When I Ambered this lab. I don't think I wrote anything down. I think I was making a video.\nASTRID: The question is, is the tape still in there?\nWALTER: There's only one way to find out. (looks at the licorice whips on the countertop embedded in the Amber) When did I switch to Grape? (a door down the exterior hallway closes and the team goes into alert mode)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (levels her weapon at the bearded security man that wanders in) On your knees.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: (as the science team surrounds him) Who are you people?\nPETER: What are you doing here?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: He's a Loyalist. He's not gonna tell us anything. (as Olivia cuffs and searches their new prisoner. reads the documentation he was carrying) Gael Manfretti.\nOLIVIA: (searches the backpack he was carrying) Nothing but bread crumbs.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (snarky) Baldies feed you well, Gael?\nPETER: (later. once their prisoner has been fully secured) Maybe this was part of his patrol.\nOLIVIA: Why would he have come here? I mean, the place is abandoned.\nASTRID: For all we know, we tripped some silent alarm.\nPETER: Either way, someone's gonna notice him missing sooner or later.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We need to stay. If that camera's the key to helping Walter remember, we have to get it.\nWALTER: I need the laser.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What about the device I used to free you with?\nWALTER: No, it won't work. The Amber's too thick. It'll probably push the camera further in. I need a proper laser.\nOLIVIA: Well, Walter, could you make one?\nWALTER: Where there's a will, there's a way.\nPETER: (as he and Olivia examine a nearby junction and fuse boxes) There's no power. At all.\nOLIVIA: All the Ambering must have blown everything.\nPETER: Yeah, Walter, I think it's blown all the way back to the Campus Sub-station.\nWALTER: Well, a laser needs power, Peter.\nASTRID: The substation's in the basement of the Science Building. That's the only way we're gonna get power.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We can get there using the tunnels.\nASTRID: Well, wait a minute. We don't even know if it's the Science Building anymore. We have no idea what's in there or what could be waiting for us.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We don't. (looks at her prisoner) But he does. I'm sure he knows plenty. (joins her prisoner alone and closes the door for privacy)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You don't seem to talk much. I'm gonna give you one more chance. What do you know about the Science Building? (getting a stonewall stare back at her) You're a real open book. It's okay. (steps to the far side of the office and brings out a small device from her pack) I'm good at opening books.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Where did you get that?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (as she activates the device and attaches it to her Loyalist prisoner's extremities) It's not important. What's important is that I have it. (after she steps back and prepares to trigger the device) What do they use the Science Building for?\n(a 'no reply' reply gets the man in his late-30's a ten second electronic joyride from hell. he convulses so violently that he appears to shift in and out of sub-atomic phase. now gray and harried, the security drone looks to have aged at least a decade in the last twenty seconds)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (menacing) I don't think you want to waste any more precious time.\nWALTER: Criterion Collection, forgive me.\nASTRID: Walter, it's just a laser disc player. We need the laser. Peter.\nWALTER: No, no. No, it should be me.\nASTRID: Walter, I don't think this laser disc tube can generate enough power. We need a better gain ratio.\nWALTER: Flying vermin. You'd think after twenty-one years the Observers would have found a way to get rid of them first. Or at least found a use for them. Maybe freeze-dry them and hand them out to the poor as sustenance. We're gonna need a helium-neon mix. There should be one or two canisters...\nASTRID: ...in the storage room off my office.\nOLIVIA: (points to the office) I'll get them.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I\u2019m gonna ask you again. What do we need to know about the Science Building?\nOLIVIA: \u2018Etta? What are you doing?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's called an Angel Device. It stirs up and destabilizes every atom in his body. Full-charge steals around twenty-five, thirty years. But this is a long way from a full charge. He's so disorientated by the process he loses the will to lie. Or he holds out until his heart fails. But most of them give us what we need to know. And if they don't? What are you doing?\nOLIVIA: I\u2019m giving him water.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You want to kill him, go ahead. That's how you'll do it. He can't have water yet. Not for another three hours. He's not worth a single tear. Loyalists sell out their own kind like rats. I know you just woke up, but look around you, Mom. Can't you see what the Observers have brought? This is war. And we're losing.\nWALTER: (from the main floor) \u2018Etta!\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I'll be right back. Just don't get too near him. (in the lab) Walter, what's up?\nWALTER: Don't you wear a necklace?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: The clasp was loose. I took it off to try to fix it. Why?\nWALTER: Then you won't mind me melting it down.\nPETER: Don't worry. We just need the silver for solder.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: How do I look?\nOLIVIA: Like you're in pain.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: You know, my absence won't go unnoticed.\nOLIVIA: I don't believe that anybody's coming to look for you. See, I don't think that you're here because we were seen or because we triggered some sort of alert. I think that you came here to feed the birds. Look, I\u2019m guessing you're probably not even supposed to be in this building, so even if you are missed, this would be the last place anybody would look. You need to tell her what she wants to know - now. You need to tell her before you get worse. You've already lost years of your life. Now come on. You must have something to live for. I'm trying to help you.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: You don't have the authority to do that. Do you?\nOLIVIA: Well, what authority do I need?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: You know a Loyalist just doesn't walk away when they've been captured by the Resistance.\nOLIVIA: How can you be so sure?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Where are you from?\nOLIVIA: Why?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: You're new to the Resistance.\nOLIVIA: I've been around a lot longer than you may think.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Look... I'm not gonna survive this. And I\u2019m not afraid to die, so I will tell her what she needs to know if you will go and tell my son I'm not coming home... And that I loved him very much. I don't want him to keep looking for me. I don't want him hoping he'll see me again. I've seen that too many times, people waiting for people who never come home. (as his captor returns and prepares another charge from the Angel Device, he gets a contractual nod from Olivia) Everyone has an access code. You can't get in without one.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: And what's in the building?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: The main power grid is still there. Other than that, I don't know. I don't go below the First Floor. We don't ask. Rumors mainly.\nOLIVIA: What kind of rumors?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Experiments.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: On what?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: On everything. My access code is a two-part code. The first part is 0-1-0-5-6-7.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: And the second part?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Me.\nOLIVIA: Can we beat an ocular scanner? We have his code to access the building, but there are scanners at every point.\nPETER: Well, that didn't take long. What's wrong? (after his daughter has joined the group) Where did this come from?\nWALTER: Barbaric. What has the world come to? How could the Resistance create such a device?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We didn't. The Loyalists did. It's old Second-Gen Observer Tech. It was designed to prepare Observers for time travel. But, as you can see, the Loyalists figured out a new way to use it on us. No reason we shouldn't use it on them.\nOLIVIA: (checks the noise outside) It's just a transport truck. We're okay.\nWALTER: Well, as far as ocular scanners go, the only surefire way is to bring him with you.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's impossible. Look at him.\nWALTER: I'm gonna look at your eye. And, if you can't bring him with you, there's only one way. (checks Manfretti's pupil dilation)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I agree.\nOLIVIA: Walter, you can't.\nWALTER: Of course I can. Rather easily in fact. Astril, I\u2019m gonna need a sharp scalpel and my long-handled stainless spoon.\nWALTER: (sitting over a dusty work bench, he attempts to surgically manipulate a single eyeball with the optical nerve hanging from the back of it. To Astrid) I'll need another. Pay attention to the texture. Make sure it's spongy. (to everyone) You know, the Viet Namese consider pigs' eyes to be a delicacy.\nASTRID: Even ones that have been sitting in formaldehyde for twenty years? (returns with next eye)\nWALTER: Yes, that should do nicely.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Are you sure this will work, Walter?\nWALTER: \"In a pig's eye.\" I wonder what the origin of that term - -\nASTRID: Walter.\nWALTER: Certainly. An iris is like a fingerprint. Each has its own unique pattern. And, if we can mimic that pattern, we can trick the scanner into thinking that this pig's eye is our tattooed friend there.\nPETER: (in a separate part of the lab getting a fake tattoo stenciled on his right jowl) The world has changed so much. It can be difficult to understand it.\nOLIVIA: I'm not sure I want to understand it.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (sees the fake tattoo) Not bad.\nPETER: Yeah?\nOLIVIA: (to Henrietta) You're next.\nPETER: How's he doing?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: He's getting there. (to Olivia after Peter leaves and she settles in for stenciling) Thank you.\nOLIVIA: For what?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: When I said it was logical for me to go turn the power on instead of you. That I know protocol if something goes off track and that Peter should go because he's the engineer. I appreciate you respecting my experience. 'Cause I know you'd rather it be you. I know you like to be in control. So do I. (gaining a look of respect from her long lost mother)\nWALTER: I did my best, but it has to be exact.\nPETER: (holds-up the eye that Walter altered) Well, is this exact?\nWALTER: We'll find out.\nPETER: (to the Observers standing in the elevator lobby after being visually scrutinized while he waits with Henrietta. casually polite) Gentlemen.\nOLIVIA: Why does someone join the Loyalists?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Pain. There were Resistance Fighters near my building. They were gonna blow up a city bus full of them.\nOLIVIA: Invaders.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: My children were outside. One of them was killed. My oldest boy.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. I know something about losing a child.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: So, after that moment, I just wanted to be safe. You know, I was angry at the Resistance because... it's hopeless. So I do this job. They give us a safe place to live, get taken care of, they look after us. And I don't have to worry, at least about my boy. I'll never understand you people. You can't win. The world would be a much safer place if you just stopped trying to fight them.\n(Henrietta and Peter stroll confidently through the interior of the Science Building headed for the Medical Wing. She gets to the cipher lock door and enters the access code Manfretti gave her. He holds out the eye that Walter duplicated to fool the retinal scanner needed to confirm the security access. none is granted)\nLOYALIST GUARD: (as he watches tracking signatures and access requests from around the campus on a monitor) What's Manfretti doing in Building Four? That's not his sector.\nLOYALIST RADIOMAN: Manfretti, come in, over. (Olivia grabs the radio. very concerned) Manfretti?\nOLIVIA: (to her prisoner) Answer it. We had an agreement. Now answer it. (holds-out the tactical radio so he can talk into it)\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Hey, there. What's up?\nLOYALIST RADIOMAN: The Hell you doing accessing the Medical Science Wing? You're supposed to be in Sector Seven.\nOLIVIA: Tell them that you needed to change a fuse.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: A fuse blew. I went to fix it.\nLOYALIST GUARD: Since when does Security change fuses? Who asked you to do that?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Number 19.\nLOYALIST RADIOMAN: Big Guy 19, really?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Yeah. Really.\nLOYALIST GUARD: Change your stupid fuse and get back to your post.\n(after a worrisome delay, the locks to the Medical Wing security door unlatch and Peter and Henrietta enter unchallenged)\nOLIVIA: (to her prisoner) You knew if they went to that area they wouldn't be cleared.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: No, I didn't. I've never been anywhere I wasn't supposed to be.\n(the walk towards the electronics bay they need to access to restore power to Walter's lab is unsettling. in one of the medical bays, a bald female sits in an examination chair wearing a patient gown. another bay contains a bald scientist in a lab jacket with multiple beakers of bubbling liquid. another room has a single container with the head a single human attached to electrodes. he opens his eyes and blinks)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Simon? (recognizing her fellow Fringe Division agent and best friend)\nPETER: (trying to stop her as she draws her weapon and prepares to rain down hell on the scientists that beheaded her trusted colleague) \u2018Etta? \u2018Etta, no, no, stop, stop. What are you doing? We have to keep on moving. (forcibly holding her back) Think of the tape. Think about what's on it. Think about your future. There will be a time for vengeance and a time for grieving, but it is not now. Stop. Stop. (earnestly) They'll pay for what they've done. (as she submits to reason, though her rage continues to well) I promise.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Do you really think you can win?\nOLIVIA: Well, we have to win. So that all the people that died, including your son, didn't die for nothing.\nPETER: (to Henrietta) Now. (she throws the Master panel breaker to close the re-energized circuit)\nWALTER: (as his lab comes alive with electronics that were left on so long ago) Let there be light.\nASTRID: Walter, we have to turn them off or someone could see us.\nWALTER: Wait. Let's see if this still works. (twice claps his hands loudly. much of the electronics power-off) Yes. (to Astrid) You ready?\nASTRID: Yeah.\nWALTER: (grabs the freshly powered laser at starts blasting the Amber from around his video camera) Invigorating. (offers the laser wand to Astrid) You want a go?\n(Peter and Henrietta return through the steam tunnel access. someone is in a mood as Henrietta heads straight the prisoner in one of the inner offices)\nOLIVIA: (privately) Peter? (concerned) What happened? (learns about what was witnessed and joins her daughter) \u2018Etta. I'm really sorry about Agent Foster.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (to Olivia) Freedom has its costs. Simon knew that. (to Manfretti) Get up. You're traveling.\nOLIVIA: Where are you taking him?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: He's useless to us now. I'm turning him over to the Resistance.\nOLIVIA: He says no one ever comes back.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: And Resistance Fighters don't come back when they're taken in by Loyalists. HQ will get whatever else they can from him and dispose of him, and the world will be a tiny bit safer.\nOLIVIA: Look, I know you're upset right now, but he did give us the code.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Yeah, of course he did. It's natural human instinct. To live as long as possible. It's the same quality they use to turn us into slaves.\nOLIVIA: He joined them in order to protect what was left of his family, you know, his son.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: He's a liar. That's what they're trained to do. He has no son. He gave you the code because he saw in your eyes a weakness. He saw in your eyes that you could be manipulated, that maybe, maybe he could convince you to let him go. But that's not gonna happen, Sweetheart.\nOLIVIA: \u2018Etta, I understand how hurt you must be.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You don't know my world.\nOLIVIA: You're right. I don't know your world. But I had hoped for you that, wherever you were, you weren't hardened by what had happened to you. And it's not that I don't see what the Observers have brought, I do. But what concerns me more is what they've taken away.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: This is The World. It is what it is. (to her prisoner as she steps out for a minute) Don't move.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: (to Olivia once they are alone) 143 Dunstable Street. Number Seven. His name is Oscar.\nOLIVIA: I keep my word.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: I know you do.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter. I need a sedative.\nWALTER: That can be arranged.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (gives Olivia a handheld device) That's a comm device. If Walter needs anything else for the laser, I'll be able to get it for him. (leaves with Manfretti)\nPETER: (as he reaches into the chasm in the Amber left by the laser and extracts the camera locked inside by Walter) There you are.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You don't have a son, do you?\nGAEL MANFRETTI: No. I was hoping, right up until the last minute, that she could somehow convince you. You were right about me. I became a Loyalist because I\u2019m a coward.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Get out of here.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: I'm gonna fight. For the Resistance. I want you to know that.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You don't have to lie anymore. I already let you go.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Well, that's why this time I'm hoping you believe me. I mean, this can come in useful. There aren't many Resistance Fighters with an active Tat I.D. You said 'I saw something in her eyes'. You were right. There was a certainty that I've never seen before, and I don't know how to explain it other than to say I felt... for the first time... that we were supposed to win. Why are you letting me live?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Something that I saw in her eyes as well. Pity.\nGAEL MANFRETTI: Pity for who?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: For all of us.\nWALTER: Got it. (as he free the cassette tape from the camera)\nPETER: It looks like the heat from the laser might have damaged the PVC.\nASTRID: It might have damaged the tape. (to Walter) I told you we should have gone slower.\nRECORDED WALTER: Whoever you are, if you found this tape, you've retrieved it from Amber. If you are watching this, then you know very well that the Observers have invaded. I am most probably dead, and unfortunately my plan to stop them has failed. I have documented all the parts of the plan on videotapes. You must recover each tape and follow the instructions on each of those tapes to retrieve all the parts of the plan. Once you do so, what you need to do will be clear to you. If successful, this plan will restore us and rid the world of the Observers. You were chosen for this. This is your destiny. I understand if you're frightened. It will not be easy, but I trust that the same will that brought you here will keep you going. It - - (disappears into static as the tape tracking fails)\nWALTER: Gentle, Peter.\n(Olivia receives a videolink of her daughter letting her prisoner go and the message)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I'm on my way back.\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nPETER: Here we go.\nRECORDED WALTER: ...but I trust that the same will that brought you here will keep you going. It is important that you follow the tapes. You must begin this journey right away. You are Humanity's only hope! Now you must retrieve the first tape.

Suddenly you have all the finesse of a butcher.\nASTRID: Walter, do you want me to do this or not?\nWALTER: This work requires a surgeon's touch.\nASTRID: I'm more than happy to let you take over.\nWALTER: Fine. Proceed. But it's on your shoulders.\nASTRID: Not even warped from the heat. Not bad for a butcher.\nPETER: Walter. Got some more fuel for the van.\nWALTER: I have Tape Number One.\nOLIVIA: Have you watched it?\nWALTER: No. I\u2019ve only just liberated it. Shall we have a look? I had a prescription. It was medicinal.\nRECORDED WALTER: Welcome to Tape Three of my plan...\nOLIVIA: What happened to Tape One and Two?\nPETER: Walter, you stored the tapes out of order.\nASTRID: Shocker.\nRECORDED WALTER: These videotapes must be retrieved. This tape will explain one of the most crucial elements that you will need. You will need to find your way to Pennsylvania... latitude and longitude coordinates forty-*ne degrees, twenty minutes, two seconds North, seventy-nine degrees, twelve minutes and thirty-two seconds West. Now, when you arrive - -\nASTRID: Really?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: See if you can rewind the coordinates.\nOLIVIA: Uh, forty-one degrees, twenty minutes, two seconds North, seventy-nine degrees, twelve minutes, thirty-two seconds West.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Are you sure?\nPETER: She's sure.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter. Do you recognize the location?\nWALTER: I'm sorry. I - if I\u2019ve been there, it's been wiped from my mind, along with the other pieces of my plan to beat the Observers.\nPETER: Hmm. The entire area is undeveloped. There's nothing around it for miles. How are the roads in and out of Pennsylvania these days? Do you think we can get all the way out there safely?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We'd need to avoid checkpoints. I mean, it's a long way to go, considering we don't know what we're looking for.\nOLIVIA: Or if it's still even there - - whatever it is.\nPETER: Hey, Walter, you think we might be able to jog your memory - -\nWALTER: I - I don't think I should travel. My feet are swollen from standing in front of the Amber all day. I'll stay here for a bit... and... regroup. What?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter, you alright?\nWALTER: I'm fairly certain I have a blood clot, because somebody wouldn't stop at Scranton to let me stretch my legs.\nPETER: Walter, we're fugitives. We can't stop every five minutes to keep you limber.\nOLIVIA: This is it?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Uh, yes... this is exactly where we're supposed to be.\nPETER: So what were you doing out here twenty-one years ago? Is that what we're out here to find?\nWALTER: I\u2019m telling you. It was a wicked Tree Dwarf.\nPETER: And I\u2019m telling you, it was a kid. I saw him. He looked right at me.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You know, I used to imagine this - - going on a mission with you. You have no idea how many battles we won together.\nOLIVIA: You know, it's a lot to live up to.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: No, you're... even more than I imagined.\nWALTER: Definitely not Dwarves.\nWALTER: Don't touch them. They could be communicable.\nMUELLER: Stop right there.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Doctor Walter Bishop. The three of you... you haven't aged a day. You were supposed to be dead a long time ago.\nWALTER: We were trapped in Amber for twenty-one years.\nEDWIN MASSEY: My name is Edwin. You were exposed when you got here.\nWALTER: I'm supposed to retrieve something here, Edwin, something very important. You seem to know me. Have we met here before?\nEDWIN MASSEY: No... at least not in the way that you think.\nEDWIN MASSEY: It's electromagnetic discharge.\nWALTER: What is this place?\nEDWIN MASSEY: You're looking at history.\nWALTER: Whose?\nEDWIN MASSEY: Ours... yours, mankind's. These are data cubes. Stored on them... are accounts of every major historical event from the day of the invasion onward.\nWALTER: You have files on us.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Of course. You're relevant. We gather important information from around the world, and then we record it. You have a healthy lore about you. My son, River, is something of an expert on the Fringe Division. We were - - we were a group of refugees from the cities. My father started this historical record. He believed our history, like that of all other conquered races before us, would be rewritten by our oppressors. Someone has to survive to tell mankind's story.\nWALTER: What happened to all of you - - your skin? You said we've already been exposed.\nEDWIN MASSEY: We noticed it after we settled. Small patches at first, and then over time, it spread. It has something to do with this area. We thought it was the drinking water or the soil.\nWALTER: Why didn't you evacuate?\nEDWIN MASSEY: What we do here is important. Even after we became afflicted, we couldn't leave. It's all here, everything. we can't move it. We can't travel. The way we look... we don't want to draw attention. We just want to be left alone to record history. No one wants to come here... which is perfect for us. You're the first in a very long time. But you and your team should leave, unless you want to look like us.\nWALTER: We can't. There was a plan to defeat the invaders. I mean, there is... a plan to defeat the invaders. And I believe it will be successful. But I don't remember it. But I know that I am supposed to get something from here. I've been here before. I must have.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Search... Bishop, Walter. If you've ever set foot in this camp before, it would be documented.\nRIVER MASSEY: Hi.\nOLIVIA: Hi. What's your name?\nRIVER MASSEY: River.\nOLIVIA: Wow. Where did these come from?\nRIVER MASSEY: I made them. Can you sign them?\nPETER: These are really good.\nRIVER MASSEY: You fought them when they came. You didn't hide like we did. You're heroes. I have a lot of different editions from stories I\u2019ve heard. A lot of them I even made up. I wish I was around during your time, when there were real heroes.\nPETER: Well, Kiddo, you're my hero - for giving me a nice, strong jawline.\nRECORDED WALTER: ...and thirty-two seconds West. Now, when you arrive at the designated place, you will need to locate - - When you arrive at the designated place, you will need to locate - - ... place, you will need to locate... ... a mine. ... to locate ... a mine. ... locate a mine.\nOLIVIA: Hello?\nASTRID: Olivia, I need to speak to Walter.\nOLIVIA: Sure. Walter. It's Astrid.\nWALTER: Yes, what is it?\nASTRID: Did you find anything in the archive?\nWALTER: Nothing. There's absolutely no record of me being here whatsoever.\nASTRID: Okay, well, I found something. Walter, is there a mine where you are?\nWALTER: - Mime. The only mime that I know of is Marcel Marceau. What's he got to do with any of this?\nASTRID: No. a mine. You said mine - - m-i-n-e - - on the tape. Walter, whatever you're supposed to find, It's in a mine.\nWALTER: Do you have a mine - - m-i-n-e - - here?\nEDWIN MASSEY: Yes. It was a gold mine.\nNEO-OBSERVER: These men have something to report.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Where?\nLOYALIST GUARD: Rural Pennsylvania.\nWALTER: In 1923, a mine collapsed in Peru. The trapped survivors were forced to nourish themselves on the dead.\nPETER: Thanks for that, Walter.\nWALTER: Oh, but I\u2019m sure that won't be the case here.\nPETER: Finding gold in an abandoned gold mine's not gonna be easy.\nWALTER: We don't know that it's gold. Whatever it is, it's in here.\nPETER: I\u2019ll climb down. Is that secure?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: There's something on the other end of this rope. Can you give me a hand?\nPETER: Yep. People have been coming in and out of this mine for twenty-one years. I doubt it's just gonna be waiting for us. Nothing is that easy. Whoa - - oh, oh. It snagged on something. It looks like he was trying to climb back up.\nWALTER: Same bark-like growth as on the people here.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: But worse.\nWALTER: I'd assumed what was afflicting these people was some sort of fungus, but I was wrong. These tissues show signs of calcification. Perhaps whatever was causing the condition of the people in the camp is emanating from this mine. And the closer one gets to the source, the more intense the reaction is. No one can survive down there. Until I\u2019ve conducted an analysis, we have to turn back.\nANIL: This is Anil.\nHOLDEN: I have something for you. Something important. \u2018Etta and her team have been located.\nPETER: Thank you. Is anybody else starving?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Here.\nPETER: What's that?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's an apple.\nOLIVIA: No, thank you.\nPETER: Yum, yum. Do you remember that amazing apple pie we had just after the invasion? We were in Boston. Someone had told us about the shelter for lost children. We were looking for a place to eat when we found that dingy little restaurant with a cook who was a mad genius. What was that guy's name?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nPETER: You don't remember?\nOLIVIA: Nope.\nPETER: Well, that's a first.\nPETER: I can't believe I don't remember the guy's name. It was the name of the restaurant. It started with a \"D.\" it was like... Dante's or Dominic's or something like that. You really don't remember?\nOLIVIA: No. I really don't remember.\nPETER: Air sample is ready.\nWALTER: I think I know what happened here. This man died of asphyxiation. Every pore on his body is completely sealed. His body was trying to protect itself against the airborne corrosive. Somehow, its pH has been radically altered. and apparently, It gets much worse the deeper one goes into the mine.\nPETER: Could whatever we're looking for have caused this?\nWALTER: Quite unlikely. If I had to theorize, it's high levels of CO2 and other gases introduced into the atmosphere by the Observers.\nPETER: From those machines that they were building in Central Park.\nOLIVIA: Well, how would that affect Edwin and his people?\nWALTER: Well, they're far enough away from the source, receiving only incremental doses. However, prolonged exposure has created a drastic immune response. Well, imagine an extreme form of Psoriasis. But not as extreme as our unfortunate mine friend here.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Doctor Bishop, I found an entry I think you'll want to see.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Five weeks after the invasion, a man came here and went down into the mine and gathered several rocks, it says here, with a reddish hue.\nWALTER: Was this man called September?\nEDWIN MASSEY: No. My father has it recorded as a man, late 30s, dark hair. His name was Donald. He says he was waiting for a scientist from Boston. I was thinking perhaps that was you.\nWALTER: I don't know any Donald.\nOLIVIA: Well, maybe you just don't remember. If he was part of the plan that you lost, then it stands to reason - -\nWALTER: No, no, no. I - I don't understand. Why would you record this? A man collecting rocks - - why is it important?\nEDWIN MASSEY: It was recorded because of what happened to him. He was taken away against his will by two invaders.\nPETER: So they weren't happy that he'd taken those rocks.\nWALTER: Why the hell would I want rocks?\nOLIVIA: Your hand, Walter. It's on your skin.\nWALTER: Yours too.\nWALTER: We're lucky. It hasn't rooted into the dermis yet. But I\u2019m afraid that won't last.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, how long until it isn't removable?\nWALTER: Until it isn't.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Doctor Bishop.\nWALTER: Oh! Good, good, good. excellent, excellent. Over here. Thank you very much. I am going to build a suit that will allow us to go into the mine. According to the arm, we would need skin 300 layers thicker than a rhinoceros to enter the mine, so I\u2019m trying to ascertain a metal or an alloy that we can use for the suit's lining. And in the meantime, I need you to go back to the van because I need the weather stripping.\nOLIVIA: Sure.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Hey, Anil.\nANIL: I got a call from one of our operatives. The Loyalists are tracking you. You've got to move.\nPETER: Did I upset you? Earlier when I was talking about the restaurant, it seemed like you were upset. I know you don't forget names.\nOLIVIA: Donovan's. That was the name of the restaurant. It's not that I can't remember. It's that I can't forget. Do you remember when we couldn't find her that day, you drew a plan on a napkin?\nPETER: Yeah. Of course I do.\nOLIVIA: You were talking about going up to Maine to this refugee camp that you'd heard about. And I was looking at you and nodding, and in my head I was thinking, I can't go. Behind you - - you couldn't see it - - but there was a wall of missing-person flyers. You know, with every day, the odds of finding our little girl the way we wanted to find her were getting worse, and we didn't talk about it. I mean, I... I couldn't put it into words then, but... I felt responsible.\nPETER: Responsible how?\nOLIVIA: I wanted so much to be a mother, but... I just... didn't think that I was programmed that way. That I was... destined for something else. Ever since I was a kid, ever since the Cortexiphan Trials, I just... I was at odds. So how could I have this incredible little girl? So, when we lost her, I felt like that was my punishment... my punishment for being too conflicted to appreciate her when we had her. And that day at the restaurant... I knew that I had to go back to New York because I didn't want to... find... what I knew we were going to find. I just... I just believed so strongly that she was dead, and I didn't want to see it. And you thought I went back because of my strength, and she said that she admired me today.\nPETER: Olivia. I saw how you were with our little girl. I know how much you love her. And I\u2019m not telling you to forget it, but... the past is the past. Don't let it get in the way of this. I don't know why it's happening, But our family got a second chance. So I\u2019m gonna take it.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Hey, guys. We have a problem. The Observers are tracking us.\nWALTER: Hand me the sealer.\nOLIVIA: Walter, how long until the suit is finished?\nWALTER: I'm going as fast as I can. Why?\nOLIVIA: The Observers know that we're in the area. They saw us on the highway when we stopped. Near Route 11.\nEDWIN MASSEY: You need to leave.\nWALTER: I need one more material - - copper.\nEDWIN MASSEY: There's only three roads you could have taken after - -\nWALTER: Jonathan here says there's an encampment down the mountain which trades metals.\nEDWIN MASSEY: No. You're not listening. We have until morning, at best, before they find us. They'll destroy everything. All of our work will be lost. You need to go now.\nWALTER: No, no, if we can just get down to the camp - -\nEDWIN MASSEY: Forget that camp. Those men are dangerous, and they won't trade with anyone they don't know.\nRIVER MASSEY: You know them. You've talked to them on your radio.\nOLIVIA: You have contacts in that camp?\nEDWIN MASSEY: I've communicated with them on my radio. But only when it suits them. They don't even know who I am. And they certainly don't want people going into their quadrant - - that much I do know.\nPETER: The way I see it, you're our only chance. They don't know us. Look, I\u2019m armed. I\u2019ll go with you. We can barter together.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Barter with what? What do you have to offer them?\nWALTER: I've got some antibiotics, medicine.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Go back to Boston, make the suit there, and then come back when it's safe.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: The baldies took away this Donald person when he went into that mine to get the rocks. If they read you and find out that we're looking for the same thing, they'll seal it permanently.\nEDWIN MASSEY: You don't even know what the rocks are for. You're putting all of us at risk. I want to help you. I do, but... what happens if I don't come back? You may be used to facing death all the time, But I\u2019m not. These are bad people. We may never make it back from their camp. I have a lot to lose, you know.\nPETER: I know you do. But the rocks in that mine are important. And it's true - - we don't know what they do. But Walter will figure it out. And when he does, we're one step closer to defeating the invaders.\nEDWIN MASSEY: I'm not afraid to die. I just don't know how to say good-bye to my son. Alright. What do you need me to do?\nPETER: Get on your radio. Tell them we're coming.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Break, break, break. Kilo-Alpha Forty-two. Come in. Looking to barter. Over. Kilo-Alpha Forty-two. Is anyone out there? Over.\nKILO ALPHA: This is Kilo-Alpha. What's your business?\nEDWIN MASSEY: I need copper.\nKILO ALPHA: We don't have copper.\nEDWIN MASSEY: Let me speak to Ivan.\nLOYALIST SCOUT: Tire tread. Matches the make and model of the van they were in.\nHOLDEN: Where does this road lead?\nLOYALIST SCOUT: Higher into the mountains.\nEDWIN MASSEY: River? Look at me, Son. What you saw back there in that tent... there's a lot more to the word coward and the word hero than you think. It's complicated. You're not a coward if you're frightened. That's not what it means. You're a coward if you know what needs to be done and you don't do it. I was telling that man out there that I have a lot to lose - - our work, the life we have here... you. I told him I love you so much, I wouldn't know how to say good-bye. When your mother got sick, I promised her I'd protect you no matter what. But I\u2019m conflicted. There's a time for recording history, and there's a time for making it. We don't get a lot of opportunities up here to make it. I've decided to help them... to do my part.\nRIVER MASSEY: I don't want to lose you.\nEDWIN MASSEY: I don't want to lose you either. But protecting you... means making sure there's a world out there that you can thrive in. I love you so much.\nRIVER MASSEY: It's okay, Dad. I understand.\nEDWIN MASSEY: No. You don't. But you will one day... when you have children of your own.\nRECORDED WALTER: (forwarded on videophone from the lab) The mineral you are looking for is a crystallized form of Quartz that contains in perfect proportion... they will unlock its potential and create a powerful energy source. I will explicitly outline these refining methods in Tape Six... or Seven. Without this energy source, we will not be able to implement the final phase of our plan. To my best calculations, we will need at least eighteen kilograms of the crystals. That is about forty pounds in Imperial measures.\nASTRID: Did you get all that?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. Thanks, Astrid.\nWALTER: Hopefully the suit will be strong enough to bring up forty pounds?\nPETER: Hey, you contact the camp? Yes. They found copper, and they're willing to trade.\nWALTER: How much copper?\nPETER: Two kilos.\nWALTER: That's plenty! Too much, even!\nOLIVIA: Okay. Let's go.\nEDWIN MASSEY: I can't. You're looking for Ivan. You can give him these for the copper. They're schematics for our solar technology. I'm not coming with you. I'm sorry. They'll trade for those. They're valuable. This'll get you to the camp. Good luck.\nPETER: Don't worry about it. We'll be back soon.\nWALTER: Wait! Be careful.\nPETER: I don't understand. This is exactly where he told us to go. He said he knew where their camp was.\nOLIVIA: Well, why would he send us here?\nPETER: Maybe he never wanted us to find the camp.\nELDER BARSKMAN: Edwin?\nWALTER: What was that?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's the mine.\nELDER BARSKMAN: There was no copper. When he called their camp, they didn't have copper. It was the only way to get what you need. You got what you came for. Now leave... before the invaders find you here.\nRIVER MASSEY: A hero died today, sacrificing himself in order to get the Fringe Team resources they need to save our world. Edwin Massey, the Recorder of History, made history.\nLOYALIST SUPERVISOR: Where did you get this vehicle?\nBEARDED THIEF: I found it on the side of the road. The keys were in the ignition. I didn't steal it!\nRIVER MASSEY: He will be greatly missed. Like other great men before him, he gave his life selflessly in pursuit of freedom... and a better future.\nWALTER: Ahh... now, this is a ride."

Looking to barter?\nPETER: No. Not tonight.\nSTORE CLERK: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plan. It's been there for a while. Guess it hits a little close to home.\nPETER: Yeah. Man... I had one of these when I was a kid\nSTORE CLERK: I'll give you a good deal, man.\nPETER: Actually, what I'm looking for is a --\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: ...This is what you are looking for\nPETER: Yup. That's it.\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: It will look good on her, the young, blonde woman. What is baseball?\nPETER: Excuse me?\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: You were thinking of the Red Sox. What is baseball?\nPETER: It's a sport - - or was anyway. How much?\nSTORE CLERK: What do you want to give me for that?\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: I am upsetting you. You do not like to be read.\nPETER: Who's upset? I've got nothing to hide. What's to be upset about? That take care of it?\nSTORE CLERK: Blood clot, man. I haven't seen one of these in years.\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: You are trying to confuse me.\nPETER: I don't know what you're talking about, Pal.\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: Who is the young blonde woman? You are protecting her.\nSTORE CLERK: Are you sure? Do you know what this is worth?\nPETER: Yeah. Keep the change.\nCITIZEN OBSERVER: There is something wrong. Detain him.\nLOYALIST ENFORCERS: Freeze! Stop right there!\nLOYALIST GUARD #1: Now! He's down there.\nLOYALIST GUARD #2: The last time I went under, I got bit by a rat.\nLOYALIST GUARD #1: He is a rat. Bite him back.\nPETER: Aaahh.\nVAGRANT BOY: Is that a real gun?\nPETER: Where am I?\nVAGRANT BOY: You came out of that storm drain. There. You're bleeding.\nASTRID: (recovers videotape from Amber) Come to Mama.\nOLIVIA: How does this one look?\nASTRID: A little less warped than the others. Hopefully it'll play better.\nWALTER: It took hours.\nASTRID: Walter, this is about as fast as we can go without too much heat damage.\nWALTER: Fast as a snail. At this rate, we will save the world in another twenty-one years.\nASTRID: I'm gonna clean this up.\nWALTER: And you know how old that will make me. I don't even want to do that math.\nOLIVIA: Peter, what happened? it's -- it's alright.\nPETER: It's just superficial. I was trying to get gas for the wagon. I got read by an Observer. He pulled thoughts out of my head like cards out of a deck.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What did he get from you?\nPETER: He did get an image of you. But at this point you're as much a fugitive as the rest of us, so, unless you can think of a reason why that would hurt us --\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Did he give any indication that he pulled anything else?\nPETER: No. I did what I'm supposed to do, keep a bunch of random thoughts in my head, but then he knew I was doing that too, so I just got out of there. These guys, they out-move us, they out-think us. They're always two steps ahead. More, if they focus. I don't know how we're gonna beat 'em.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: We beat them one-by-one. Instinctively, you did the right thing. You just have to create a labyrinth of planned thoughts, keep them preoccupied.\nPETER: Yeah. Trying to block that reading was exhausting. I couldn't do it. It's impossible.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: It's not impossible. I've taught others. It just takes a really long time.\nPETER: Well, teach me.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I plan on it. I'm teaching you all.\nPETER: In the meantime, I want you to consider this a down payment on my first lesson. You had to give up your necklace so we could work on the laser. I wanted to make sure you got a new one.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Thank you.\nPETER: Worth every bump and bruise, Kiddo.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Well, you know the expression. No good deed goes unpunished.\nPETER: Living proof.\nBROYLES: You wanted to see me?\nRECORDED PETER: You do not like to be read. Who's upset? What's there to be upset about? I got nothing to hide.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: This is what he purchased - - an alloy of gold and other metals, minerals, Argentite, and Chlorargyrite. What is its purpose?\nBROYLES: Its purpose? You wear it. You put it around your neck.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: He is a fugitive. Why put oneself at risk in this quadrant for something so unexceptional? These fugitives are confident enough to walk freely. I think they receive information. The Resistance is protecting them.\nBROYLES: You mean they're being tipped off?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: To our movements, yes. Two days ago, one of the men in your Division failed a Security Test. I believe he is with the Resistance. I think you will be able to get information about the fugitives through him.\nBROYLES: Why didn't you tell me about the Security Fail?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I could ask you the same question.\nBROYLES: I didn't know about it.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: That is my point.\nBROYLES: I'll look into it.\nRECORDED WALTER: Welcome to Tape Two of my plan to defeat the Observers. Before we begin, first and foremost, you must accept the reversibility of all phenomena... particles have their speeds reversed, then the changes - - found a measurable effect. Let me be crystal clear - - understanding of these scientific concepts, we will not be fighting in the same field. These are the plans that we must follow to the letter - - imperative that these plans be retrieved.\nOLIVIA: Astrid, it's impossible to tell what he's talking about.\nASTRID: This is as clear as I can get it.\nRECORDED WALTER: I have hidden them as I would my most prized possession. Funny story actually. When I was a boy, my mother would take me on what she called Manhattan Mystery Tours. We would catch the first train that came to the station, and then we would venture into the city... ... and get off at the first - - I'll never forget - - inspirational.\nASTRID: The tape is ripped. It got caught on a fleck of Amber.\nWALTER: I've heard enough. I know where the tube is.\nOLIVIA: You do?\nWALTER: Mmm. The subway platform beneath Newark-Penn Station in the wall.\nASTRID: How do you know that?\nWALTER: Because, as a boy, my most prized possession was my collection of detective comics. And, like everyone, I was terrified that the Pinkos would attack. So I thought that a subway platform would be the safest place to hide them. Because it was underground. I was ten.\nPETER: And that's where you hid the plans?\nWALTER: Yes.\nOLIVIA: Under Newark-Penn Station?\nWALTER: I am sure of it.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Every major access point to Manhattan has an Observer checkpoint. That includes train stations.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we have to take out the guards.\nPETER: Are they Observers or Loyalists?\nOLIVIA: Both.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Both. I don't even know if we can get close enough to effectively take them out without being detected.\nOLIVIA: Well, we need to create a diversion.\nPETER: I think we're gonna need a lot more than a diversion.\nWALTER: Peter. I'm going to want to get to that rolling cabinet in the Amber.\nASTRID: Walter, there's nothing in there except lab equipment and your Easy-Bake Oven.\nWALTER: I'm not after what's in it. It's what's under it. Astrif... prepare the laser.\nASTRID: Walter, why won't you tell us what's down there?\nWALTER: (opens the hatch to a subterranean storage area) Because I'm not sure that what's down there is worth talking about. I'm not sure what's left. Here. Use some of this. All of you. It's Mentholatum. Not as bad as I thought.\nOLIVIA: Walter, is this what I think this is?\nWALTER: My cold storage of all the Fringe Events we have ever encountered, dormant for twenty-one years. If we are going to find a diversion to get into the railway station, we'll find it here.\nPETER: What do you suggest, Walter?\nWALTER: There was a time when we solved Fringe Cases. Now I think it's time we created a few of our own.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: So this is every Fringe Event?\nWALTER: Documented and preserved to the best of my ability. Oh, look, Olivia, my Porcupine Man.\nOLIVIA: You really had no idea that he was doing any of this?\nASTRID: I wouldn't have slept at night if I did.\nWALTER: Some secrets are meant to be kept. For two reasons - - Number One: Because they're mine. And Number Two: I have a healthy distrust of the government. These items were safer with me. Oh! (to Henrietta) Put that down. You'll Amber us. It's an Ambering Device. Put it down gently. Hair trigger, if I recall correctly.\nPETER: There has got to be a better option for getting us into that train station than a portal that lets us see into another universe.\nWALTER: I suppose you're right. We'll have to go through all this to see what's still viable. The answer is here somewhere. Oh, my goodness.\nASTRID: What is it?\nWALTER: It's my old doughnut hole. Jelly. It's still spongy. It's still good.\nHOLDEN: Why am I still here?\nINTERROGATOR: Two days ago, you failed a security test. That's why you're nervous.\nRECORDED INTERVIEWER: So you are a recent graduate of The Academy?\nRECORDED HOLDEN: Yes.\nRECORDED INTERVIEWER: And your date of induction?\nRECORDED HOLDEN: April 25th, 2033.\nRECORDED INTERVIEWER: Were your parents proud to see you in uniform for the first time?\nRECORDED HOLDEN: My parents are deceased.\nRECORDED INTERVIEWER: Did you think of them during the ceremony?\nRECORDED HOLDEN: I missed them being there if that's what you mean, yes.\nRECORDED INTERVIEWER: What was the weather like?\nRECORDED HOLDEN: What?\nRECORDED INTERVIEWER: That important day, what's the weather?\nRECORDED HOLDEN: It was sunny.\nMUELLER: On April 25th, 2033 in Boston, rainfall began approximately at 10:20 AM and continued steadily well into the evening. You were never at The Academy.\nHOLDEN: No, you're mistaken. I was Class 58693-Tech-A.\nMUELLER: You are a member of the Resistance. Someone forged your paperwork to be installed in your position. You cannot conceal it. I can see it. Right... there. What do you know about the fugitives? Where is Peter Bishop? Where did he go? Where are the fugitives hiding? You overheard Anil say something? What did you hear Anil say? Forget about him for a second. I saw something else... that interests me. The Dove. Who is The Dove? Hmm? What is his real name?\nHOLDEN: I don't know! Nobody does.\nBROYLES: What did you discover?\nMUELLER: He is a low-level operative. His information is limited. I found bits and pieces, but not everything.\nBROYLES: We've heard the name \"The Dove\" three times now. What else?\nMUELLER: When I said the name Peter Bishop, he recalled a moment when he overheard Anil mention a lab in Sector-B. I think you know this as the old Harvard University. I thought you would recognize it. You had a relationship with these fugitives that I thought we would call upon.\nBROYLES: Now how did you know that? That I had a relationship with them?\nMUELLER: Captain Windmark told me. He said he was going to ask you about it. He did not?\nBROYLES: I knew them, but that was a long time ago.\nMUELLER: According to this man's knowledge, they are in the lab. I will make my report.\nWALTER: Pull.\nASTRID: Walter! Technically this is a Weapon of Mass Destruction.\nWALTER: So is the mosquito that carries the West Nile. This will do beautifully. A perfect delivery system.\nOLIVIA: Looks like there are more Loyalists. What was the count before?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Three, four.\nOLIVIA: Now it's seven. It's not going to be easy getting into this subway station. Where'd you get that? (spent small caliber round)\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I found it... at our old house on Quincy Street. I wanted to remember things. I don't know. I just wanted to be there. It made me feel closer to you. It was looted. The entire block was. Upstairs in your bedroom, what used to be your bedroom, I found what was left of your old jewelry box. And there was this matchbox inside. I shook it and found this. I figured it had to be important, or you wouldn't have kept it.\nOLIVIA: How long have you been wearing it?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Since I was thirteen. You want it back?\nOLIVIA: No. No. No, I want you to keep it. Let me see it. You know your father used to call this the Bullet that Saved the World.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: (answers call) The lab's been compromised.\nOLIVIA: Peter.\nPETER: What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: We need to go now.\nPETER: Well, we're ready.\nOLIVIA: No, the Observers know that we're in the lab.\nPETER: How? Who told you that?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Somebody I trust. We don't have time.\nWALTER: We cannot leave the lab. Without the tapes, we have nothing. Forget the blueprints. Forget the rocks from the mine. Forget whatever is in the tomb. None of it means anything without the plan. There goes The World. The world ending.\nPETER: Once they see we've been here, we'll never be able to set foot in the lab again.\nOLIVIA: I have an idea. Walter, we need to re-Amber the lab.\nLOYALIST ENFORCER: (to HQ, as the assault team inspects Walter's abandoned lab) There's nothing here. It's just an Ambered lab.\nLOYALIST TEAM 16: Control. The building is secure. 1-6 heading back down.\nCONTROL: Copy that. Confirm. Return to Base.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: No one has been in that lab. The reading from the prisoner was deceptive.\nBROYLES: Well how is that possible?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Somehow she hid her thoughts from us, deceived our readings. Perhaps others can as well.\nLOYALIST GUARD: Still on watch.\nLOYALIST SUPERVISOR: You're relieved then. Perimeter?\nWALTER: (pulls the station wagon to a halt at the electronic barrier) Hi. Perhaps you can help me. I'm trying to get to Kennebunkport, Maine.\nGATE GUARD: Let me see your Travel Authorization.\nWALTER: Of course. thing is, I've been driving around in circles. I was hoping you might help me with these directions.\nSECURITY OBSERVER: I will handle this.\nWALTER: The thing is, I'm a bit lost. (zapped in neck. unphased) You electrocuted me.\nSECURITY OBSERVER: Your authorization - - now.\nWALTER: Of course. Here we are.\nPETER: They're gonna meet us around back.\nWALTER: Here we go. (enters the terminal area)\nPETER: Alright, Walter. You're up. Where is it?\nWALTER: There.\nPETER: Kilroy?\nWALTER: I drew that. It must be in the vent.\nPETER: There's a line. It's got something heavy.\nWALTER: It's the tube.\nOLIVIA: Let's go.\nWALTER: Peter!\nOBSERVER: Unh! Unh!\nLOYALIST GUARD: There!\nPETER: I'm in. Go, go, go.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: What's written on it, Walter?\nWALTER: It's some kind of physics. It's beyond anything I've ever seen. I don't understand.\nOLIVIA: Well, Walter, it's your handwriting, so, even if it was wiped from your mind, you must have understood it at some point.\nWALTER: Perhaps it was dictated to me.\nPETER: By September? You think he gave you these equations?\nWALTER: I don't know.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Do you think you'll be able to figure it out?\nWALTER: Don't you understand? This is Greek to me, except that I read Greek. This is Aramaic to me. Not the Western Dialect. I do speak a little.\nPETER: Walter?\nWALTER: I don't know what this is. I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: Okay, well, we should get back to the lab.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Not yet. Somebody wants to see you.\nBROYLES: Agent Dunham.\nOLIVIA: Phillip.\nBROYLES: It's good to see you, Doctor Bishop. Peter. I asked her not to tell you in case...\nPETER: ... we were read.\nBROYLES: When I heard that you were back, I tried not to, but I had to see you. Five years ago, I got called to a crime scene outside the city, and I saw Etta for the first time. And, even though she was turned away from me, I could have sworn I was looking at you. It wasn't until I told her who I was that she admitted the truth, that she was your daughter. Once I knew, I had her transferred into my section. I had a mind I was gonna look after her, but she taught me. She recruited me in the Resistance, taught me how to block them from reading my thoughts.\nPETER: How long did that take?\nBROYLES: Nearly a year.\nLOYALIAST SUPERVISOR: They used an airborne toxin. It hyper-activates a protein that generates scar tissue.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Barbaric. What was their purpose here?\nLOYALIAST SUPERVISOR: They took something that was hidden inside. What, we don't know.\nLOYALIST AIDE: Captain Windmark.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Yes.\nLOYALIST AIDE: One of our men died holding this. I think we're gonna be able to find them.\nBROYLES: HK Pistols with rechargeable power cells. Pulse rifles, motion sensors, scent cones.\nPETER: Anti-matter batons?\nBROYLES: Fourth Gen. Delayed fuse. Blast radius of one hundred meters. And, once it's armed, it can't be deactivated, so when you use it, make sure you don't stick around.\nOLIVIA: How on Earth did you get this stuff?\nBROYLES: It wasn't simple. Tell Anil he owes me. Seeing you makes me realize how much I miss Boston. Maybe I'll put in for a transfer. It's alright. I've apprehended them. They found you.\nPETER: How?\nOLIVIA: They put a tracker on us. That Loyalist before we drove off.\nPETER: You can't let 'em find you here with us.\nBROYLES: You won't make it by car. Run.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Protect the plan - at all costs.\nBROYLES: Peter!\nPETER: Go!\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Get out of here!\nOLIVIA: We can't stay here.\nPETER: The far end. Down there.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: There.\nPETER: They know we're in here.\nLOYALIST SUPERVISOR: Cover every entrance.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter, run. I'll cover you.\nPETER: Cover me while I get to the stairs.\nOLIVIA: We've got to go back for them.\nPETER: We will. We're gonna double back. Ready? Go!\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Walter!\nLOYALIST TROOPS: Go, go! On your Six. Clear it, clear it. Move, move!\nPETER: Walter?\nWALTER: Peter?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: Unh!\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: He bought the necklace for you. For what purpose? I would like to know. Love. You never know when to give up.\nOLIVIA: 'Etta.\nPETER: Etta. No. No, no, no.\nOLIVIA: Henrietta, look at me, okay? You're going to be okay. Etta? But we have to move you, okay?\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: No. There's no point.\nPETER: We're not gonna leave you here.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: You have to. You won't make it with me. I'll slow you down. You have to leave.\nOLIVIA: 'Etta. I love you so much.\nHENRIETTA BISHOP: I know.\nPETER: No. No, no. No. I can't leave you. Not again. No. no.\nWALTER: Son, we have to go.\nLOYALIST SUPERVISOR: We're sweeping Buildings Two and Three now, but there's no sign of them.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Love. They would go back for her.\nND OBSERVER: You were wrong.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: The necklace.\nWALTER: We need to leave. She's gone, Son. We have to go. She's gone, Son."

(starts loading the weapons in a shoulder bag, waking Olivia)\nOLIVIA: (sits-up) I fell asleep. I keep waking up and thinking that I'm dreaming this terrible thing and then I realize that it's not a dream.\nPETER: Yeah. I know.\nOLIVIA: Why would we get her back just to lose her again? (accepts a hug. then cleans-up to leave. studies the pictures from her daughter's youth)\nCONCERNED PEDESTRIANS: (as small streaks of electricity appear from thin air and make contact with objects) What is that? Hey, you feel that? Yeah. Where's it coming from? Whoa! Get off the street! Storm coming in or something?\n(a Loyalist convoy drives into the anomaly with a flatbed tractor-trailer rig not far behind. they immediately unload their equipment and the Observers with them initiate the task they came to perform. one removes a small metal cube from a container, places it in a precise position in the middle of the street and activates the device. a large, black, two-dimensional portal opens in the middle of the street and three large white containers slip through.)\nSUPERVISING OBSERVER: (cuts a small opening in the side of the cloth skirting covering one of the containers and checks the shipment) Integrity is stable. Prepare for transport.\nLOYALIST CREWCHIEF: (to the flatbed truck driver) Come on through!\nPETER: Come on, Walter. It's time to go.\nWALTER: It's this one. May I keep this? 'Etta's perfume. It's the one she liked. It reminds me of her. Oh, my memory, it fails me. But my sense of smell helps me remember.\nPETER: It's yours.\nWALTER: Thank you.\nPETER: (answer cell phone) Hey, Astrid. Everything okay?\nASTRID: Hey. I've run into a bit of a fire hazard, so there's no tape yet.\nPETER: (studies the image she is feeding him in Walter's lab) What is that?\nASTRID: You see that white tube-y thing? That is a propane tank for Walter's hibachi. And that see-through blob over there, that is a gallon of Ethanol.\nWALTER: Abner, why did you leave the propane tank there in the first place?\nASTRID: Someone wanted to cook bratwurst.\nWALTER: Why is the Ethanol there and not in the cupboard?\nASTRID: Because someone wanted to use the Ethanol to clean the hibachi before they cooked the bratwurst.\nWALTER: At this rate, we won't get another tape until Wednesday.\nASTRID: More like Thursday.\nWALTER: Well, thank you, Dear. Try and go as fast as you can. That's 'Etta's phone.\nANIL: Olivia. I didn't know if you'd answer.\nOLIVIA: Anil.\nANIL: I didn't know how else to reach you. I took a chance.\nOLIVIA: I understand.\nANIL: Olivia, it's important that we meet.\nANIL: I'm so sorry for your loss. She was special. Not just to me, but to the movement. I hope someday you'll understand how much.\nWALTER: What on Earth caused this?\nANIL: Well, we believe it's the result of The Baldies opening a shipping lane... from the future.\nWALTER: A wormhole.\nANIL: The reports we heard say that it started with strange static electricity in the air.\nOLIVIA: What are they shipping from the future?\nANIL: They're bringing back components for the air-degradation system that they're building in Central Park. Similar burn radiuses were reported in France and Egypt, where the other air-degradation systems were built. If they finish this machine, their air quality manipulation will be complete on all continents.\nPETER: And our lifespan will be reduced to forty-five years. We know that already. 'Etta told us.\nANIL: If the pattern of what happened overseas holds, this is just the beginning of many more shipments. The Resistance wants to destroy the next one when it comes. I wanted to know if you knew anything about their language. If we're gonna sabotage a shipment, we need to know when it comes, and we're hoping the answer is in that book.\nOLIVIA: Well, I'll see what Astrid can make of it. Where did you get it?\nANIL: It came as a package deal.\nNIEMANN: Niemann.\nANIL: Okay, show them our visitor.\nWALTER: You captured an Observer?\nPETER: Good work.\nANIL: We caught him here yesterday. He was walking around taking measurements. Then this morning, this happened.\nOLIVIA: Well, did you get any information from him?\nANIL: No.\nWALTER: What is it, Peter?\nPETER: Whatever happened, it started here. Something incredibly powerful was sitting here. A square.\nANIL: A cube. Yeah, the Observer we caught yesterday... he had tech on him. It was a cube about that size. It had parts, and it came in a case.\nPETER: I think that cube is the tech that opens the door. Can we get the one that you have?\nANIL: What do you want with it?\nPETER: I'm thinking bigger than just one shipment. I wanna hit 'em harder. If the cube is what opens the door, maybe it's powerful enough to destroy it. Why stop at one shipment if we can destroy the entire corridor?\nOLIVIA: Well, how would we do that?\nPETER: I don't know. But look at the destruction that it causes. You're talking about a tremendous amount of energy.\nANIL: We don't understand this. We don't know how it works.\nPETER: Not yet.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: Anil is right. We don't know exactly what we're dealing with here.\nPETER: I've made up my mind.\nWALTER: Do you have anything I could use to take samples of the carbon?\nANIL: Yeah. I have a collection kit in the van.\nOLIVIA: I'll get it.\nANIL: Before you go on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\nPETER: I'm not worried about being destroyed. It's the Observers who should be worried. If we're gonna take out this portal, we're gonna need that cube.\nANIL: Bring the cube.\nNIEMANN: Copy that.\nPETER: (gets shocked\/burned by a component piece of the cube Anil gave to him) Son of a bitch!\nASTRID: (studies the data Anil gave to Olivia) If this really is a shipping manifest, then I'm expecting dates, times. I can't even differentiate which of these symbols are letters or numbers. This decryption program has been running for over an hour. I can do this, you know? It is understandable if you are overwhelmed. I mean, you're in shock.\nOLIVIA: I think it's best if I just focus.\nASTRID: Oh, my gawd.\nOLIVIA: What?\nASTRID: I've been looking at this all wrong. (writes on her notepad) What do you see?\nOLIVIA: A \u2018B\u2019.\nASTRID: To us, it's a \u2018B\u2019. But they don't think like us. To them, maybe this is a \u2018B\u2019 and a \u2018C\u2019 and an 8 and a 6 and a 56. This program is looking for a one-to-one correlation. Any of these symbols could have many different meanings, so... for every page, two hundred symbols -- it's just too large. There's too many possibilities. We have to run multiple decryption programs simultaneously. I need more computing power. Alot more.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I'm gonna call Anil.\nWALTER: Peter.\nPETER: The amount of power coming off this thing is off the charts, and it's not even turned on. It's a strange alloy, but no magnetic properties.\nWALTER: The only thing I know for certain... is that it has the ability to blow us to Kingdom Come. We don't even know if we're putting it together right. If you are still intent on doing this, I believe it is possible to destroy the shipping corridor. But it is extremely dangerous.\nWALTER: Think of everything on top of this sheet as the future, where they are. When the Observers transport a shipment from their future to our present, they drop them down a wormhole that they created. Because the wormhole is stable at both ends, matter and energy in their future is unaffected. Life goes on undisturbed. However... if we were to collapse our end, sealing it off... everything they put down the wormhole... will just weight it down. The result is like a vacuum, sucking all matter and energy into itself, consuming it.\nPETER: You wanna turn the wormhole into a black hole.\nWALTER: Yes.\nPETER: So we collapse the wormhole on our side, and all that's left on their side is a black hole and a hell of a lot of destruction. Excellent, Walter. So how would we do that? We'd need to use - -\nWALTER: Anti-matter.\nPETER: The batons that we got in 'Etta's apartment. Alright. I'd still need to get close enough to throw one into the corridor.\nOLIVIA: That's not going to be easy. When the shipment arrives, it's gonna be crawling with Observers and armed Loyalists waiting for it.\nWALTER: That's where the cube comes in. Do you remember the electric swirls of static electricity that were reported before the corridor opened? Imagine they're like a telephone ringing. Like a call from the future. The cube answers that call and the corridor is opened.\nPETER: So we just have to answer the call first.\nOLIVIA: But we haven't figured out how to turn the cube on.\nPETER: The Observer that Anil captured. He certainly knows how to make it work.\nWALTER: Anil couldn't get the Observer to make heads or tails of it either.\nPETER: Well, Anil has his way of doing things, and I have mine.\nOLIVIA: Now Peter, you're sure about this?\nPETER: I'm sure we can't let 'em finish the air-degradation system.\nOLIVIA: Well, I know that. But Anil said that it would take them some time.\nPETER: We have this opportunity now.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, but what about Walter's plan? We have a mission. This could put that in jeopardy.\nPETER: I'm not doubting Walter's plan. But what do we have? Pieces we don't know how to put together. A scroll with physics we can't decipher, a thought unifier that doesn't work, and a box of rocks from a mine. That's what our daughter died for so far. If we can do this, we have something tangible - - a real victory. It could take them years to recover.\nOLIVIA: Okay, I wanna hurt them too.\nPETER: So then what is it? What, Olivia? Are you worried about me?\nOLIVIA: Yes. Yes, I am. I'm afraid.\nPETER: Nothing's gonna happen to me. I can do this. We can do this. Our daughter dedicated her life to freeing us. And now, we're gonna dedicate ours to making sure that that means something. When we win, when we beat them, I want everyone to know that 'Etta is responsible for the world being saved.\nOLIVIA: I want that too.\nPETER: Then we have to do this. And we can, Olivia. Together. Wish me luck.\nANIL: Hey.\nPETER: What's the concoction?\nANIL: A wee bit of this, a wee bit of that. Cryoprotectants, osmolytes. Small molecules within their blood preventing damage to their vital organs. Compounds that act as natural anti-freeze.\nPETER: Anti-freeze?\nANIL: Yeah, it keeps them tethered to this location. They're actually not as hearty as you'd think. Their abilities are aided by tech.\nPETER: Yeah, I've heard that. Well, hello there.\nANIL: Right. Let's wake this bastard up. Good morning, Sunshine. Come on! Rise and shine! That's it. That's the cold stare I know and love. You dead fish. This is my friend. He's meaner than I am. So I guess you know where that leaves you. You good?\nPETER: Good. Thank you. You recognize this, right? You're gonna help me put it together.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: You do not have use for it.\nPETER: Oh, but I do have a use for it. I just need to know how it fits together, and I need to know what powers it, and I need to know how it works. To do that... I need to turn it on.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: You must understand your compatriots have gleaned no information from me. You will not either. You believe you are more capable of success where others have failed.\nPETER: You read me. See if you can read my thoughts right now. Anything? It's okay. I know you know. I can feel you banging around inside there. But it doesn't matter what you find out. 'Cause you and I both know... you're never walking out of here. Whatever the closest thing it is to fear that you can feel, I know that you're feeling it right now. You're not the only one with a skill for reading people.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: You don't even know what you don't know.\nPETER: We'll see.\nPETER: You and I both know the variation of a magnetic field produces an electric current if the pieces of the cube are assembled in the proper order. But what's the proper order? Oh, that's right. You're not going to tell me.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: You are pleased with yourself.\nPETER: I'm feeling optimistic... if that's what you mean.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: Your skill is impressive, but it is of no consequence.\nPETER: You have no idea what we're capable of.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: I think of you as I would an ant colony as I pass by it. I don't care about the workings of the colony, why one ant is mad at another or why one ant would kill another or not. To me, it is insignificant. And like an ant colony, you are oblivious to your limitations. You think the black over your head is dark skies... when it is really our shoe.\nPETER: You talk a good game. But the truth is you're worried.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I thought that you said it was gonna take some time before we were able to free another tape.\nWALTER: This tape was never in Amber. I found it in my desk. It's a video of one of \u2018Etta's birthdays. It would be incredibly difficult to watch, but I believe it's important for you and Peter to see it.\nOLIVIA: Walter, I am holding on by a thread. You do understand that?\nWALTER: I heard you... when you were talking to Peter. You told him that you were afraid. He assumed that you meant you were afraid for his safety, and of course you are, but I think we both know it's more than that. You're afraid that you will lose each other again. I'm trying to tell you that I see what you see. And that's why this tape is so important. You must watch it and remember what you both had, what you still are, and you must hold on to that. You must face this pain together. The pain is her legacy to you both. It's proof that she was here. I have experience with this - - this sort of pain, and you can't escape it by building walls around your heart. Or by breaking the universe. Or by vengeance. You lost each other once... but you have another chance.\nOLIVIA: I can't.\nASTRID: I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: It's okay.\nASTRID: Um, We did it. We decoded the book. It is a shipping manifest. The next shipment is this afternoon.\nPETER: Now, this next piece... if I attach this incorrectly...\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: ... We will be obliterated.\nPETER: But how do I do it? Which way is the right way? Four possibilities. Three of them are wrong. And I'm relying on you to tell me.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: Then you are relying on a faulty premise. I do not fear death. Whatever choice you make, it makes no difference.\nPETER: Consciously, yeah. That may be true. But your origins are human. No matter how advanced you become, you will endeavor to stay alive at all costs. In extreme situations, your body will react on a subconscious, organic level. There are 'tells' your conscious mind can't control. For instance... good news... and your pupils dilate. Bad news... and they contract. Not just a theory. In fact, I'm sure of it.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: Are you?\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: The corridor is opening near Lexington and 86th today. We have about thirty minutes.\nPETER: I see.\nOLIVIA: Will you be ready? Peter? Peter, are you still there?\nPETER: I'm on my way.\nLOYALIST RADIO: Let 'em know we're clear. Holding positions. We have to shut the whole area down. Eastbound as well. Wait for primary reading.\nANIL: It's activated.\nOBSERVER TECHNICIAN: I have not activated the stabilizing mechanism.\nSUPERVISING OBSERVER: Something is wrong.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, it is that type of gun.\nANIL: Let's go! Let's go!\nPETER: Go!\nOLIVIA: Go!\nPETER: What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: I mean, we destroyed it. We created a black hole. How could they recover so quickly?\nWALTER: I can't explain it. If the corridor were sealed at this end, then a black hole must have manifested in the other. The Observers on that side would have been sucked into the vortex, their operation crippled for years. It should've worked. It must've worked.\nOLIVIA: Hey, where are you going?\nPETER: To get answers!\nOLIVIA: Peter! Hey, Walter, can I call you back? Peter! Peter?\nPETER: You can leave. I'll take it from here. Why didn't it work?\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: You don't even know what you don't know. Before going on a journey of revenge, dig two graves. Your friend was correct. Emotions get in the way of judgment.\nPETER: Emotions did not get the better of me. I read your tells to help me assemble the device.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: Your assertion regarding the involuntary response of the body to physical threat was interesting but highly antiquated. It does not apply to us. In truth, there was a fly on the window. As my cerebral cortex registered it, there was a small irregularity in my heartbeat, causing a slight deregulation of my oxygen to my brain which in turn affected my oculomotor nerve. This oculomotor nerve is what caused my pupil to dilate. That's what you picked up on, my observation of a fly. But you ascribed meaning to something that was not there. You saw what you wanted to see. You believed what you wanted to believe, because that's what your emotions do. They ascribe meaning to something that is not there. They fool your perception as to what is real.\nPETER: No. you're wrong.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: A dog does not smile, no matter how many times your kind might think it does. You put together the device because of your intuition and your knowledge and your experience as an engineer. You simply needed confidence, so you made sure you saw what you needed in my reactions. You blame us for her death, but it is irrelevant. She was here, now she is simply not here.\nPETER: Did you feel that? She is not simply gone. She will be remembered! Unlike you. If I kill you right now, no one will remember you. No one will miss you.\nCAPTURED OBSERVER: Miss me?\nPETER: You are nothing but tech. I would be ten times what you are if I had that tech in my head. You're wrong about emotions not being real. My feelings for her are very real. Can you feel that? The pain of a piece of you being torn out? That's the pain a father feels when he loses a child.\nRECORDED PETER: Think you can do it in one again?\nRECORDED HENRIETTA: I'm gonna do it again.\nRECORDED PETER: Oh, my gawd! You're a pro! You did it.\nRECORDED HENRIETTA: No way.\nRECORDED PETER: Take that out.\nRECORDED HENRIETTA: Take that out and take that. Kiss Mommy.\nRECORDED PETER: Good, Your Highness? Watch out, I'm coming for your cake! If you're gonna open a present, which one would you like to open first?\nPETER: Hi.\nOLIVIA: Peter. Peter I want you to come home. I don't want to lose you.\nPETER: It's okay, Olivia.\nOLIVIA: 'Etta would want us to be together, you know? She would want us to survive this. I just - - I love you.\nPETER: I love you too."

But you know that already. This is Tape Seven. I don't have much time, so I\u2019m going to show you how to get the next piece of the plan and explain on the way. I am on Quincy Street heading South.\nHOLOGRAPHIC HENRIETTA: Hey, I just wanted to let you know I'm gonna be a little late getting back. Uh, didn't want you guys to worry. I've got one more report to file, and then I\u2019m out of here. So I\u2019ll see you soon. (replayed) Hey, I just wanted to let you know I'm gonna be a little late getting back. Uh, didn't want you guys to worry. I've got one more report to file, and then I\u2019m out of here. So I\u2019ll see you soon.\nOLIVIA: Peter? Peter.\nPETER: How did you get here?\nOLIVIA: The Monorail. You didn't come home this afternoon. You weren't answering your Comm.\nPETER: Yeah, I - I turned it off. I wasn't going to stay for that much longer. I just needed to see her.\nOLIVIA: I've thought about coming here too. I feel closer to her here. No, it's okay. Play it. Play it.\nHOLOGRAPHIC HENRIETTA: Hey, I just wanted to let you know I'm gonna be a little late getting back. Uh, didn't want you guys to worry. I've got one more report to file, and then I\u2019m out of here. So I\u2019ll see you soon.\nOLIVIA: Peter, when you feel like this, I just want you to include me. It's fine that you come here. Just tell me. I want to understand what you're going through, and I want you to understand what I\u2019m going through.\nPETER: You're right. I'm sorry.\nOLIVIA: What is that?\nPETER: When we collapsed the corridor, one of the Observers nicked me. It's okay. I'm fine.\nRECORDED WALTER: Here we are. 167 Cedar Street. Now we need to make our way to the Fourth Floor. Apartment 413. Hopefully without running into this tyrannical...\nRECORDED NOSY NEIGHBOR: You again. You're a friend of that renter up on four, aren't you?\nRECORDED WALTER: More of a colleague.\nRECORDED NOSY NEIGHBOR: Well, I don't know what you're doing up there in that apartment, but if I hear any more strange noise, I'm calling the Super.\nNOSY NEIGHBOR: Do I know you?\nWALTER: I need to get into Apartment 413. Is it occupied?\nNOSY NEIGHBOR: Fourth Floor has been red-tagged for twenty years. Nobody goes up there. Hey, what's your business here?\nWALTER: None of yours.\nASTRID: Walter? Walter? Hey. I was wondering where everybody was. Have you seen Walter?\nPETER: No, why?\nASTRID: Well, I went in to wake him up. His bed has not been slept in. He's not in the cold storage. He also left the Amber laser on and on the floor. The tape we were working on last night is already out of the Amber. I think he left.\nPETER: He knows better than to go out alone. What the hell is he thinking?\nRECORDED WALTER: At the moment, I am on Quincy Street heading South. The Red Line to Worcester Union Station. Whatever mode...\nPETER: Maybe he's gone off to follow this tape.\nOLIVIA: He's retracing his steps?\nRECORDED WALTER: I have created, or rather, we have created a unique and efficient hiding place for a critical piece of the plan to defeat the Observers. It is undetectable to the Observers' instruments. As I have mentioned... may I help you?... as I mentioned, I have had some experience with transversing parallel universes. What we have done is we have opened a space in the membrane that separates the two universes. A pocket universe', if you will. This is very important. Do not, under any circumstances - - is that raspberry filling? Raspberry, is it? Two. Now, since the pocket universe exists in inter-dimensional space, many of the usual laws of physics won't apply. And there are few places on Earth where two plus two does not equal four. And this is one of them. It can be quite disturbing. Try not to worry about it. This tape will guide you every step of the - - here we are. 167 Cedar Street.\nPETER: Cedar Street? That's Downtown Worcester.\nRECORDED WALTER: Apartment 413...\nASTRID: 167 is in the Q-9 District. That whole neighborhood has been bombed out. It's mostly abandoned.\nRECORDED DONALD: Hi, Walter.\nRECORDED WALTER: Take this. My arms are getting tired. Uh, Donald...\nPETER: Donald?\nOLIVIA: That was the name of the man that was waiting for Walter, twenty-one years ago?\nPETER: Yeah.\nRECORDED WALTER: Your eyes are not deceiving you. The effect is caused by light refracted off - - well, never mind, that's not important. But down here, these lines denote the trans-dimensional demarcation. They'll prove useful. You will need to refer to them. Donald, leave the camera with me. I realize, whoever you are, that this must seem very complicated. It is. Extremely. But don't fret. It will all become clear once we're safely inside. The sequence goes like this. Now, kick out ninety degrees to the right. Back two meters. And then to the left. And pivot two hundred and ten degrees to the left. And step out.\nPETER: What happened?\nRECORDED WALTER: And step out.\nOLIVIA: Is it damaged?\nASTRID: I don't see any grinding or flecks of Amber. Maybe they just stopped recording.\nOLIVIA: Well, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, if Walter's gone to retrieve whatever it is that's in this pocket universe, then why would he go alone?\nPETER: I don't know. It's not like him.\nWALTER: Not that way. Oh!\nWALTER: Are you Donald?\nCECIL: No, I\u2019m Cecil. How did you get here? Do you know how to get out of here?\nWALTER: Yes, I do. And you'll never know if you keep threatening me. How did you end up here, Cecil?\nCECIL: I was in one of the apartments. The Resistance must have been in the area because the in - - the invaders hit the whole block with light bombs, and... the last thing I remember was a flash. And then I woke up here.\nWALTER: You were blown into here. The force of the explosion of the light bombs must have blown you here, which is most likely why you're still alive. When did this happen?\nCECIL: I've been here five days.\nWALTER: Five days? But how have you survived? There's no food here, no water.\nCECIL: There's water.\nWALTER: Show me.\nCECIL: It's mine.\nWALTER: If you hope to ever get out of here, you will show me.\nPETER: You sure this is the right place?\nASTRID: I\u2019m sure.\nCECIL: Don't worry, you won't fall. I've managed almost half a cup every night.\nWALTER: Something behind this wall. Perhaps some kind of... refrigeration unit. That's what's causing the condensation.\nCECIL: No. I\u2019ve been all around this place every which way. There's nothing on the other side of this wall.\nWALTER: I'd like to have a look for myself. Follow me.\nCECIL: What I'd like to know is how you know your way in and out of here.\nWALTER: 'Cause I've been here before. I just can't remember it.\nASTRID: I'm surprised he made it up there.\nPETER: Walter's full of surprises today. Walter! Walter!\nCECIL: I thought we were leaving.\nWALTER: Not until I find what I came for.\nCECIL: For a while, I thought this was Purgatory.\nWALTER: What have you done to deserve that?\nCECIL: The apartment I was in wasn't mine. I was stealing things. I wouldn't have been there otherwise.\nWALTER: What could be worth stealing in those bombed out apartments?\nCECIL: They weren't bombed out when I got there.\nWALTER: You've been here five days, right?\nCECIL: Yeah.\nWALTER: Those apartments are condemned. The building was blown up twenty years ago. What year is it?\nCECIL: It's 2016.\nWALTER: It's 2036.\nCECIL: What are you talking about?\nWALTER: Perhaps, in some way, you are in Purgatory. This is a pocket universe. Time and space loop in on themselves here. So you can't get out. That's why it just seemed like days to you.\nCECIL: My wife is waiting for me.\nWALTER: Not anymore. Let's go.\nOLIVIA: Look at these footprints. He was here. He must have gone into the pocket.\nRECORDED WALTER: Kick out ninety degrees to the right.\nPETER: There's only one way to find out.\nRECORDED WALTER: Two meters, and then to the left. And pivot two hundred and ten degrees to the left. And step out. Donald, how are we doing? Am I in focus?\nRECORDED DONALD: Not yet.\nRECORDED WALTER: I'll wait.\nPETER: Look at this. Back in the lab, it went to black. It was the end of the tape.\nRECORDED DONALD: We're ready.\nPETER: And now there's more footage.\nOLIVIA: Well, how is that possible?\nRECORDED WALTER: You are now in the pocket universe. Don't be alarmed. You will notice that things work differently here. You'll see a door. Go through it. You'll see a long hallway. Turn...\nRECORDED DONALD: ...Left, Walter.\nRECORDED WALTER: Left. Thank you, Donald.\nPETER: Looks like something Walter would've designed when he was tripping.\nRECORDED WALTER: Follow me. What you're about to find is very important.\nMUELLER: Captain Windmark, I've just been alerted. Walter Bishop has been sighted in Quadrant 9.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You are certain.\nMUELLER: Yes.\nRECORDED WALTER: Now, reaching the hallway, turn right. Not left. If you continue on to where the hall you're in dead-ends, you will find that it's not a dead end at all. Are you getting this, Donald?\nRECORDED DONALD: Yes, Walter.\nRECORDED WALTER: Because it doesn't look like the camera's recording.\nRECORDED DONALD: It's fine, Walter.\nRECORDED WALTER: But the light's not on.\nOLIVIA: He's right.\nRECORDED WALTER: Wait, no, now it is on.\nRECORDED WALTER: This way.\nRECORDED DONALD: Walter, wait.\nRECORDED WALTER: What's wrong? Why aren't you coming? Oh, dear. Are you afraid?\nPETER: They're not alone.\nRECORDED WALTER: There's nothing to be afraid of.\nPETER: He's talking to somebody else.\nOLIVIA: It's someone besides Donald?\nPETER: Yeah, look. His eye line is different.\nRECORDED WALTER: Through the Looking-Glass, and what Alice found there? This place is like that.\nOLIVIA: Walter!\nWALTER: There's nothing in there.\nOLIVIA: Walter.\nWALTER: Olivia... Peter. (to Cecil) Wait there.\nPETER: Walter. You know you're not supposed to leave the lab alone.\nWALTER: I'm so sorry. I don't understand. All I thought about was retrieving what was on that tape. I couldn't think about anything else. All I cared about was finding the next piece of the plan.\nOLIVIA: Is that Donald, Walter?\nWALTER: No, that's collateral damage. That's Cecil. He is completely irrelevant to the plan!\nPETER: So what's he doing here?\nWALTER: He ended up here through a series of unfortunate events. He was blown here by an explosion.\nOLIVIA: When?\nWALTER: Twenty years ago, but for him, it's only been days. Everything within this pocket wraps in on itself, including time. That's why we have to hurry and find whatever it is I hid here.\nPETER: Walter! There's more on the tape. You can't see it until you enter the pocket.\nWALTER: Of course. The time anomalies wouldn't allow the camera to operate properly. Let me see.\nRECORDED WALTER: The key is... to know what you're looking for. In this case, we're looking for the apple. The Forbidden Fruit. The root of all knowledge. It will mark the place where you'll be staying... for what, I promise, will be a short time. And it will be safe and comfortable, I assure you.\nWALTER: Who is that?\nPETER: You honestly don't recognize him?\nWALTER: It must have been wiped from my mind, like the other parts of the plan.\nPETER: No, Walter, it was a case that we worked. The boy, he was living underground. A demolition site.\nOLIVIA: Maybe Walter didn't experience the case in the same way that we did.\nWALTER: Is he one of them? An Observer?\nOLIVIA: Well, at first, we thought that he was just a boy. But then he started to exhibit empathic abilities. He helped us find a murderer.\nWALTER: An Empath. Remarkable. Why would I need an empath?\nOLIVIA: I don't know. It was twenty years ago.\nWALTER: But not for him. Like Cecil, to him, he's only been waiting for days. Like I said on the tape, we used this place to hide him, to keep him safe until someone could return for him. Press play, Peter. Show me more.\nRECORDED WALTER: We're nearly there. Now we're looking for an apple. This one. What's that, Donald?\nWALTER: These markings are very strange.\nPETER: Of all the things we've seen in here, Walter, That's what you find strange? There's the hand.\nRECORDED WALTER: Well, I wonder where it could be? Would it be - - Oh. Oh-ho! Here we are!\nWALTER: There it is.\nRECORDED WALTER: Oh, just wait here now. Donald, please.\nWALTER: Here it is. He's not here. Where is he? Where is he?\nRECORDED WALTER: We designed this room just for you. You must stay here and wait for us to return and get you. Oh, for us, it could be quite a long time, but... for you, it will seem like no time at all. Now you see where we've kept him. To understand his purpose, refer to Tape Eight.\nOLIVIA: You definitely left him here. Maybe Donald moved him. It has been twenty years.\nPETER: Walter... I think this is a portable air-degradation unit.\nOLIVIA: So he - - he was an Observer.\nWALTER: What difference does it make? He's gone. Do you understand? He was a part of the plan somehow. And without all of the parts, the plan is useless!\nOLIVIA: Walter, calm down.\nWALTER: No, it's too late! They must have gotten this out of my mind. Windmark! He must have found the boy! Everything we've done is for nothing! It's for nothing.\nPETER: Walter?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Search parameters remain the same. Building to building... door to door.\nPETER: There you are. If the Observers had known about this pocket, they would have shut it down a long time ago. The only person other than you that knew this place existed and how to navigate it is Donald.\nWALTER: That makes sense. But why would he move the boy?\nPETER: I don't know. Maybe he thinks you're dead. We were missing for a long time. And you have no idea who Donald is, where you met him, nothing?\nWALTER: No.\nPETER: We have to find him. Donald. whoever he is. It's the only way we'll ever know for sure.\nOLIVIA: Walter, Peter? I think I've got something. It's not there. Did you see this radio anywhere in that room?\nPETER: No.\nOLIVIA: No. I think whoever took the boy left this behind.\nPETER: Purposely?\nOLIVIA: Mm-hmm.\nWALTER: Batteries must be dead.\nOLIVIA: Or it doesn't work in this pocket. Like the video camera, things work differently here. So once we get it outside...\nWALTER: Of course. That's brilliant, Olivia. And perhaps it will somehow help us get to Donald. Assuming he's still alive.\nPETER: So should we get out of here?\nCECIL: Please.\nASTRID: Oh, come on, guys. Oh!\nPETER: Walter, we have to move. Back down the stairs. Go. go! Stop. This way.\nWALTER: That's it. You found it, Peter.\nPETER: Olivia, cross right here. You okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nPETER: Olivia, move. There's no time. Get Walter out of here. I'll draw them off and meet you at the Monorail. Go! Oh!\nOBSERVER #2: I know what you have done. You have made a grave mistake. You do not realize what is happening to you.\nPUBLIC ADDRESS: The doors are closing. Clear the walkway.\nOLIVIA: Walter, he's not coming. We got to go back for him.\nWALTER: Peter.\nOLIVIA: How'd you do that?\nPETER: Do what?\nOLIVIA: Get us out of there? How'd you find your way back to the portal?\nPETER: I don't know, but I\u2019ll take it.\nPUBLIC ADDRESS: Please take your seats.\nASTRID: What's wrong?\nOLIVIA: This radio was left for us in the pocket universe. Look, the tuning dial has been jammed. It's, like, stuck on one frequency.\nASTRID: Why? Nothing's being transmitted.\nOLIVIA: Not yet.\nPETER: You okay, Walter?\nWALTER: I can't stop thinking about that man. All he wanted was to get out of there. And I didn't help him. I didn't care about him. All I cared about was...\nPETER: ...Saving the world. Walter. You are not responsible for that man's death. He died twenty years ago, The night he broke into that apartment and the light bomb went off. If it wasn't for your pocket, he would have died then and there.\nWALTER: Perhaps. I saw a man... half-starved. And I used him because it suited me. Because he was nothing more than an acceptable loss as long as I got what I needed. Is that who I am, Peter? Is that something you can see coming from my mind? From my heart? Am I the person that would... leave in the middle of the night on his own?\nPETER: Walter.\nWALTER: Those are the actions of a man of hubris, arrogance. And that's not me, Peter. It's him.\nPETER: Him?\nWALTER: Don't you see? I'm not safe. It's my mind. Ever since the pieces of my brain were reimplanted, it's been changing... me... back into the man I was before. Bit by bit. I'm losing myself, Pete. I'm losing the man that you helped me become.\nPETER: Listen to me. I'm not gonna let that happen. We need you. You are our only hope to defeat the Observers. And I\u2019m gonna be here with you, every step of the way.\nWALTER: Please, Son. Whatever happens, don't let me go.\nPETER: I won't, Dad. I promise."

You were gone for over two hours.\nPETER: He wasn't as interested in bartering as I anticipated. It took some convincing.\nWALTER: Gasoline for neon-helium seems like a fair trade to me. You only got four? Well, it will have to do.\nPETER: Hey.\nOLIVIA: You're back.\nASTRID: Oh, great, Peter. More laser fuel. I'll hook this up after breakfast.\nWALTER: Get started. The world's not going to save itself. Chop-chop.\nOLIVIA: You left without me. I wanted to go with you.\nPETER: It was so early. You were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you.\nOLIVIA: That's one way to put it. The other is that you didn't sleep again.\nPETER: That's true. I couldn't sleep. But I'm fine.\nOLIVIA: You need to sleep, Peter.\nLOYALIST PATROL: Locked. What do we got?\nLOYALIST SUPERVISOR: On the move.\nLOYALIST DRIVER: Rolling.\nOLIVIA: We're okay.\nRECORDER WALTER: This is Tape Five of my plan to defeat the Observers. This is what you must achieve next. These cylinders were designed by the invaders. They are Beacons that allow them to locate different points in space-time. You will need two of them. This is where you will find them.\nWALTER: I know that building. That was one of our labs at Kelvin Genetics. Belly and I designed it.\nRECORDER WALTER: From the East Entrance, follow the hallway, two yellow doors. They lead to a staircase. At the bottom of that staircase, you will find the private storage of William Bell. At the time of recording this, Bell was keeping two Observer cylinders in that storage facility. You must retrieve them. The doors are made of reinforced steel. They can be unlocked with Bell's handprint.\nASTRID: Walter, that's why you took Bell's hand when we were freed from the Amber. You said that it was for a storage facility. It was for this.\nRECORDER WALTER: If you cannot find Bell or if you learn that he is dead, you will have to unlock the storage...\nWALTER: So that's why he was with us in the Amber. I needed him to get the cylinders.\nRECORDER WALTER: Your freedom depends on it.\nASTRID: Walter, that's not the only reason.\nWALTER: Hmm?\nASTRID: Well, before the invasion, you had been talking with Bell. He said that he wanted to help you defeat the Observers, that he realized how important this was. And then he betrayed us to gain favor with them.\nWALTER: I do remember something about this. He came, and I trusted him. There was another man. He had an accent. I was being tortured. He kept asking me something. He kept asking... is it safe?Then I escaped, and Bell helped me. And then he drove me right back where I was being questioned. He worked for them. He worked for them!\nASTRID: Walter, that's from the movie Marathon Man.\nWALTER: Huh.\nPETER: You called me in Boston. You told me that you were ready to implement the plan but that you needed my help to do so.\nOLIVIA: Then you sent me to Grand Central Station to collect the Thought Unifier.\nPETER: And by the time I got to you and Astrid, you were with William Bell, but then the Observers found us, and we realized that the only way they could have known where we were is if he told them. That's when you Ambered us.\nOLIVIA: So if Bell led the Observers to you, how can we be sure that the cylinders were even there to begin with?\nASTRID: Or if he even had them? Let's open his storage and find out.\nWALTER: Fire up the laser, Agnes. Let's get that hand out of Amber.\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nOLIVIA: Is this it, Walter?\nWALTER: Yes. I used to drop acid right over there and watch the ships come in from the bay. This was the East Entrance. The yellow doors to the underground storage are here somewhere.\nPETER: The doors are there.\nOLIVIA: Peter?\nPETER: From an engineering standpoint, they'd have to be.\nOLIVIA: No, Peter, your ear.\nOLIVIA: When we closed the Observer's shipping lane, Peter fired anti-matter into it with an RPG. Do you think maybe the blast damaged his ear?\nWALTER: How's your hearing, Son?\nPETER: My hearing's fine. I\u2019m fine. Really.\nWALTER: I want to examine you as soon as we get back to the lab.\nPETER: What are you thinking, Astrid?\nASTRID: We have some anti-matter batons left. Maybe we could use them to clear a path to the door.\nWALTER: Anti-matter would consume not only the debris, but the storage facility underneath as well.\nOLIVIA: What about Anil? I mean, he has manpower. Maybe The Resistance would help us.\nPETER: The heavy machinery we'd have to use to clear away all the rubble would draw too much attention.\nWALTER: We go through it.\nPETER: It's Anil.\nASTRID: What do you mean, we go through it, Walter?\nPETER: How did it go?\nANIL: I couldn't give him the briefcase.\nPETER: What happened?\nANIL: I followed the Baldie into the park. I did everything just like you said.\nPETER: You should have seen him sit at a bench. And you should have seen him stand up and forget his briefcase. You would have then approached him and given him the one that I gave you.\nANIL: He never forgot his briefcase, Peter. He was sitting on the bench. I saw him get up. But he took his briefcase with him.\nPETER: That's impossible. Wait there. I\u2019m coming to you.\nWALTER: Peter, we need to see Nina Sharp.\nOLIVIA: Walter thinks that if we can change the molecular structure of the concrete, then maybe we can clear it.\nASTRID: Nina works for the Ministry of Science. She's got access to advanced technology.\nPETER: Okay, you go talk to Nina. I have to meet up with Anil.\nOLIVIA: Why?\nPETER: He didn't want to say over the comm, just that it was important. You've got that look on your face.\nOLIVIA: What look?\nPETER: The look that says, I'm worried about you.\nOLIVIA: Should I be?\nPETER: Absolutely not. You go talk to Nina. I'll liberate myself a ride.\nNINA\u2019S ASSISTANT: Ms Sharp? Ms Sharp?\nNINA: Uh, push my afternoon meeting. I'll be out of the office for a bit. I never thought I would see you again. So how are you holding up?\nOLIVIA: It's been hard. But we are continuing on with Walter's plan... for \u2018Etta.\nNINA: I'm so sorry for your loss. \u2018Etta was very special to me. And when Phillip told me... I wanted to reach out to you so much, but I was afraid that I would jeopardize your safety.\nOLIVIA: I know. But now we have no choice. We need your help, Nina.\nNINA: Of course. Anything.\nOLIVIA: Well, despite the damage to the building, we still think that the underground storage is intact. We just can't get to it.\nWALTER: I was hoping you would have access to technology that could... change the atomic structure of the rubble, and help us clear it.\nNINA: The Observers created a device that dramatically alters atmospheric pressure, speeding up molecules in all the matter in a controlled area. A process called Sublimation.\nWALTER: You mean converting solid matter directly into gas?\nASTRID: So all the rubble would just evaporate?\nNINA: Well, essentially, yes. They used the technology to clear large areas of land for construction, like Central Park, when they were prepping it to build their air-degradation machine. I'll meet you in the South Side of the building in ten minutes.\nNINA: Are you angry with me, Walter?\nWALTER: Why should I be?\nNINA: Because I told \u2018Etta and Simon how to reimplant the portion of your brain you had removed.\nWALTER: You did what was necessary.\nNINA: Yes, I did. We needed your intellect restored. There was a lot at stake. There still is. Have you noticed any changes in your personality since the implant?\nWALTER: Some.\nNINA: The tissues are integrating faster than I thought.\nWALTER: The man I was before... do you see him in me now?\nNINA: No. But you would know better than I. Are you worried?\nWALTER: The man I was before, he was consumed by ambition, by hubris. He never cared about anyone. All he cared about was walking with the gods. It's different this time. I\u2019m different. I have Peter. He won't let me become that man again.\nNINA: Hastings. Give Doctor Bishop anything he wants. Yes, that Doctor Bishop.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: Well, it would be an honor.\nPETER: There must be some variable you're forgetting. Tell me exactly what you saw - - every single detail.\nANIL: The Baldie was sitting on the bench, writing in his notebook.\nPETER: Did he interact with anyone in the park?\nANIL: No, not that I saw.\nPETER: Did you see a little girl? She would have been playing with a yellow ball in front of the bench Royce was sitting on.\nANIL: How could you know that?\nPETER: Royce was supposed to be distracted by the kid playing as he stood to get up. He was going to forget his briefcase.\nANIL: No, Royce wasn't paying attention to any kid. He was talking on his comm.\nPETER: He was on his comm?\nANIL: Yeah. I was too far away to hear anything. He stood up, grabbed his briefcase, and walked away.\nPETER: That's it.\nANIL: That's what?\nPETER: The variable. The one thing that I failed to see - - Royce on his comm.\nANIL: Peter, what are you talking about?\nPETER: He's going to the restaurant next. Give me the briefcase. I'll switch it there. I know that you have questions, Anil, but I\u2019m just gonna have to ask you to trust me.\nANIL: What's this?\nPETER: An address. Go there, and wait outside.\nANIL: This is a Baldie precinct.\nPETER: At exactly 6:17, Royce and another Observer named Mueller will walk into that building. Call me when they do.\nANIL: I'll comm you when they show.\nPETER: Thank you.\nPETER: I'd like to check this.\nCOURTESY DESK: Sure. I haven't seen you in here before.\nPETER: It's not really my crowd.\nCOURTESY DESK: You better be careful. You don't want to get read.\nPETER: You should get that. (phone rings) Old trick.\nASTRID: How are you and Peter doing?\nOLIVIA: Peter doesn't sleep. He leaves the lab at all these odd hours. And when he gets back, and I ask him where he's been, he's always got an explanation that - - that makes sense. But... I just think there's something he's not telling me. I can feel it.\nASTRID: Well, he's been through a lot. I mean, you both have.\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\nASTRID: I'm not defending Peter. I saw how isolated he made himself after \u2018Etta went missing in The Invasion. I would say that, compared to that, he has come a long way.\nOLIVIA: I keep telling myself that this time we're stronger. I'm - - I'm worried that... I'm losing him again.\nCOURTESY DESK: Hello. Cavatina. I'm at work, Ronny. Can we talk about this later? Because unlike you, I have a job.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: This baby has an event radius of up to one thousand meters. These rods, they mark the boundaries of whatever area you want to Sublimate.\nASTRID: What's this?\nDARRYL HASTINGS: Don't touch that! I haven't even showed you the 'power-up' sequence yet. You see this light here? It turns yellow, you're good. But blue, that means the fission core is overheating. That's a common design flaw in these Gen-One models. Blue... means run. Okay.\nNINA: I'm worried about you, Walter. What you said earlier - - that Peter would keep you from becoming the man you used to be. I'm not sure that's enough. I knew the man you were - - you and William. You both tested the limits of science, of the universe. You felt that boundless power that comes with omnipotence. You felt what it was like to be God.\nWALTER: You don't need to remind me, Nina. I was there.\nNINA: Then you should know how hard I tried to hold on to William. How much I loved him. But that wasn't enough. I wasn't enough. Because nothing can compare to that feeling - - to that kind of power. So he let me go.\nWALTER: The reason you couldn't hold onto him is because he never loved you. He never loved anyone except himself. I've been fooled by him too many times to think anything else. I know better, and so should you.\nNINA: You asked me before if I saw him in you. I just did. The Walter I know would never say anything so cruel. But the Walter who lay on an operating table in William's laboratory, begging to have pieces of his brain removed, for fear of what he would become, he would.\nWALTER: I've come a long way. I love my son, he loves me. That will save me.\nNINA: For your sake, I hope that's true.\nOLIVIA: Walter... we're ready.\nNINA: Oh, there's one other thing that you should know. The Observers analyze any change in the atmosphere, so once you utilize the technology, they will respond within minutes.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Then we'll have to be quick. Thank you, Nina.\nNINA: Good luck.\nWALTER: Is that ready, Dear? Well, come on down and set this one for me.\nPETER: Hello?\nANIL: You managed to switch the briefcase.\nPETER: What happened?\nANIL: It was a success. This place is crawling with Baldies.\nPETER: Go home, Anil. I'll contact you.\nOLIVIA: So what did Anil want?\nPETER: I waited for him for over an hour - - he didn't show. That was him calling to let me know that he got stopped at a checkpoint.\nOLIVIA: Did he tell you why he wanted to meet?\nPETER: No.\nWALTER: Olivia, Peter, we're ready.\nPETER: So what do we have?\nWALTER: Matter Sublimation Device.\nASTRID: It converts solid mass into gas.\nPETER: Perfect.\nWALTER: Stand by.\nPETER: It's charged, Walter. Go ahead.\nWALTER: Belly, you monster!\nPETER: What is it, Walter?\nWALTER: My Bowie... he stole it. It's not enough that he institutionalized me, betrayed our friendship, but he pilfered my record collection as well!\nOLIVIA: We don't have time, Walter. Keep looking.\nPETER: Guys...\nWALTER: I know this safe. I remember when Belly had it built. An extra measure of security to guard the things he valued most. The cylinders must be in here.\nOLIVIA: Walter, do you know the combination?\nWALTER: Of course. Belly used the same combination for everything. He had a terrible memory. Too much LSD, I suppose.\nASTRID: Walter?\nWALTER: Yeah, just - - just give me a minute. It's very simple, I just - - I think I have it.\nASTRID: Come on, Walter. Nina said the Observers would detect the atmospheric change. We've been down here too long already.\nWALTER: I - I'm sorry. It was so long ago.\nOLIVIA: Walter, if you don't think that you can do it, we should leave, now.\nPETER: Clear your head, Walter. Try to relax. Think about the cylinders. You have all the time in the world.\nOLIVIA: Peter, the Observers could be up there right now.\nPETER: Take a deep breath, Walter. Focus.\nWALTER: Five...Twenty... Ten. I should have known better than to trust that scoundrel. It was all a lie to lure me to the Observers. He never cared about saving the world.\nASTRID: What is that?\nOLIVIA: I don't know, but whatever it is, it must have been valuable enough to Bell for him to want to keep it in the safe.\nOLIVIA: What did you just do?\nPETER: I have no idea.\nOLIVIA: Peter, careful. We don't know what's waiting for us. Peter, where are you going?\nPETER: I'll take my car. It's logical that we split up.\nWALTER: Olivia, before we go back to Boston, I'd like to make a stop first.\nWALTER: Nina.\nNINA: Walter. Did everything go okay?\nWALTER: Yes. The device you gave us worked. We have the cylinders.\nNINA: Good. Why did you want to see me?\nWALTER: I asked Olivia to bring me back because I wanted to give you this. It was in William's safe. I was wrong. He did love you. And it wasn't enough.\nNINA: No...\nWALTER: I'm scared, Nina. Every day that goes by, I feel him more and more. I'm losing myself. I'm becoming the man I was. And just like before, everyone that I care about will be driven away and will suffer because of me. I need you to take them out.\nNINA: What?\nWALTER: It's perfectly safe. My intellect may be diminished slightly, but it's the only way to hold on to the man I've become. Please, Nina... You must remove these pieces of my brain.\nOLIVIA: Peter?\nPETER: They're timelines.\nOLIVIA: Timelines for what?\nPETER: For them. Windmark's top Lieutenants. For security reasons, they're rarely in the same place at the same time. Every movement, every interaction, every second of their day is accounted for. Using this information, I can manipulate events. The tech that gave them their advantage over us... I have it now.\nOLIVIA: That thing in their heads - - you implanted one in yourself?\nPETER: I've been following them. They don't know where I am, but I know where they are. Today, yesterday, and the day before that. It gives me enough information to determine their probable futures. Mueller was going to get in a town car and be late to the meeting. Royce would have left. I needed them there at the same time. I made that happen.\nOLIVIA: What have you done?\nPETER: I used a toxin from Walter 's cold storage, the flesh-eating toxin that killed everyone aboard Flight 6-2-7. Our first Fringe experience... was their last.\nOLIVIA: That's why you knew that they wouldn't be coming for us at the storage site. You knew that they would still be responding to your attack.\nOLIVIA\/PETER: (simultaneously) You can't do this. This is... dangerous.\nPETER: We're going to avenge \u2018Etta. Windmark is next.\nASTRID: Walter. Is there anything I can get you before I go to sleep?\nWALTER: No. Thank you, Dear.\nASTRID: We did good today."

He has gained the ability to run futures.\nRECORDED WALTER: This is Tape Eight. There is a scrap yard located in the town of Fitchburg, forty-six miles Northwest of Boston. You will go to Fitchburg and acquire an industrial-size electromagnet. You may have seen this kind of magnet used in automobile junking, construction, demolition. But as I say, it is an indus-- extremely large and extremely powerful.\nWALTER: Olivia. Good. You're here.\nASTRID: We freed another tape, and we have to retrieve a magnet Walter left in Fitchburg.\nWALTER: What's wrong? I don't understand. When did Peter do this?\nOLIVIA: I don't know.\nWALTER: What's happening to him? What are the manifestations?\nOLIVIA: He's reading time like they do, thinking ahead like they can. He knows what I\u2019m gonna say before I say it. It's like it's him, but... it isn't. Walter, he's convinced that this is the only way to beat them. If you could find out what it's doing to him or if there's a way to neutralize it - -\nWALTER: I'll start running diagnostics right away. Of course, it's meant to be integrated with organic material. I need to see how it interacts with an actual brain.\nASTRID: And whose did you have in mind?\nWALTER: Perhaps my porcupine man's. I preserved his brain in formaldehyde. Could you go down and bring it up, please? It needs to be submerged in water immediately.\nOLIVIA: It's Peter.\nWALTER: Let me talk to him. Peter, where are you?\nPETER: I\u2019m in New York, Walter.\nWALTER: Peter, listen to me. You must come back to the lab. What you've done, son, is extremely dangerous.\nPETER: I can't do that. I called to warn you not to go back to 'Etta's apartment. It's been compromised.\nWALTER: Please come back to the lab, Peter. We don't know what we're dealing with here. I - I'm very frightened. W - we don't know what that device is actually doing to you.\nPETER: I understand why you would be concerned. But I also know there is nothing that I could say that would change your mind. You cannot possibly see what I see. Trust me when I tell you... I am in complete control.\nWALTER: I don't believe you are in control. Son, you promised me. You said you would be there for me. Do you remember -- to keep me from slipping? I need you. I'm begging you. Please come back in and let me run some tests.\nPETER: I have to go, Walter. Do not go back to 'Etta's apartment.\nASTRID: What are we going to do?\nOLIVIA: Did he say where he was?\nWALTER: New York. That's all. 'Etta's apartment isn't safe, and I don't know where he's going.\nOLIVIA: I - I can't stay here. I\u2019m crawling out of my skin.\nWALTER: What are you doing?\nOLIVIA: Well, you and Astrid need to work on the tech, so I\u2019m gonna try and find this magnet.\nWALTER: Alone?\nOLIVIA: We have no other option.\nASTRID: What about Peter?\nOLIVIA: All I can do is just keep our promise to 'Etta and -- and stick with the plan.\nTEA SPILLER: Sorry. Please, let me.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: That's enough.\nCARLOS: Morning.\nOLIVIA: Good morning.\nCARLOS: I'm Carlos. How can I help you?\nOLIVIA: I would like to barter for a magnet.\nCARLOS: What'd you say?\nOLIVIA: Uh, an electromagnet, like the one you have on that crane.\nCARLOS: Wait here.\nSIMONE: I'd like to sell you the piping, but I got people depending on me, and they need to eat. I'm willing to barter. Let me know. What is it, Carlos?\nCARLOS: Got a woman outside. She's asking for a magnet.\nSIMONE: It's her. Send them. Send them now.\nSIMONE: My name is Simone. Carlos said you were interested in a magnet.\nOLIVIA: That's right. I know this is a little out of the ordinary, but - -\nSIMONE: Yes. We have it for you. We've been expecting you.\nOLIVIA: Expecting me?\nSIMONE: I've been waiting many years for someone to come for that magnet. Come. I'll show you. This is your truck. It's been your truck for twenty-one years... to transport it. A man came here soon after The Invaders arrived. The man spoke with my mother. They talked for a long time. He said he had a way to save the world... but he needed a giant magnet to do it.\nOLIVIA: Was his name Walter? Walter Bishop?\nSIMONE: I don't remember his name. He was older... grayish hair. My mother assured him that she would keep a magnet packed up and ready for when he came back for it. Before she died, she made me promise to keep the candle burning. And I did. It wasn't always easy. At times, we were destitute. There were people who wanted to sell the magnet and the truck. They lost hope. But my mother never did. And neither did I. And here... here you are. I sent for diesel fuel. It's on its way. I know you don't mind waiting, and you'd rather drive after nightfall.\nOLIVIA: How do you know that?\nSIMONE: I know a lot of things. I see flashes sometimes when I\u2019m around people. Like before, when I met you, I saw that you have a bullet in your pocket - - a slug. I've always had a gift.\nWALTER: Even with electricity coursing through the neural tissue, the brain is dead... not quite human... most likely damaged by the preservation process. But in order to understand what's happening to Peter, we have to give this a shot. The chances of this working... are remote at best.\nASTRID: Okay, I\u2019ve got a clear image.\nWALTER: The question is... how do I attach...\nASTRID: Oh.\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nASTRID: It worked. Whoa. This is a lot of neural activity. I've never seen anything like this.\nWALTER: It's all moving along the Cerebral Cortex, which controls higher-level thinking.\nASTRID: It stopped.\nWALTER: The device must've detected that the brain isn't suitable. Did we gather enough data to extrapolate?\nASTRID: Let's see. Okay, if we take the process that we just saw and then we run it continuously, what happens to the brain over time is... Walter, are those new ridges forming?\nWALTER: Hmm. The more convolutions, the higher the brain function in mammals. Do you see that?\nASTRID: Hmm.\nWALTER: The Cerebral Cortex is becoming so thick that it's overriding the area used to control emotions. Remarkable. Controlled evolution. It's worse than I feared.\nSIMONE: Where are they? They should be here by now.\nCARLOS: I wouldn't worry. They'll be here soon.\nOLIVIA: Hi. What's your name?\nDARBY: Darby.\nOLIVIA: I'm Olivia.\nDARBY: I know. Everybody's talking about you.\nOLIVIA: Yeah? What are they saying?\nDARBY: They said you're on Reward Wire. There's a bounty on you.\nOLIVIA: Really? What else did they say?\nCARLOS: Darby?\nDARBY: I have to go.\nSIMONE: I thought you might be thirsty.\nOLIVIA: What's in it?\nSIMONE: Water.\nOLIVIA: What's in the water... a sedative? You gonna knock me out?\nSIMONE: What are you talking about?\nOLIVIA: Nobody's gone to get diesel fuel, have they?\nSIMONE: You're wrong. Ahh. You have no faith. I could feel that when you came...\nOLIVIA: I'm done with the parlor tricks. I want my truck and my magnet now.\nSIMONE: When the fuel gets here, you can have it... unless, of course, you'd like to leave now. Your car's over there. You can come back with more people if you want. But we're still gonna be here. You lost someone.\nOLIVIA: That's an assumption that you could make about anybody.\nSIMONE: But you lost your daughter... twice.\nCARLOS: Fuel's here.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Did you think you are the only one who can manipulate futures? I know that you have been making adjustments to mine. I have been making adjustments of my own. We know you switched the briefcase. We traced it back to the restaurant. And that gave us an origin point for you. I knew you were at the intersection when you caused me to miss the light. The two events were in close enough succession that I could determine a probable future. I have led you here to this place. Everything has taken place as I intended. This was what she saw. This was her last thought before she expired. Your emotions make you weak.\nSIMONE: I can understand why your faith has been shaken. But there are mysteries to the universe. My gift is evidence of that. The fact that you are here is evidence of that. Your rational mind can't make sense of your loss. But your heart, if you allow it to, will find its own intuitive way. I'm getting a strong feeling. Your daughter's still with you... even now.\nOLIVIA: Simone, you have a gift. You can see things that other people can't. I don't doubt that. But... wherever you think this gift came from or whoever you think bestowed it upon you, it's simply an anomaly. I know that because I\u2019m an anomaly. I have moved things with my mind. I've lit things on fire. I\u2019ve caught bullets midair. I've seen things that people only dream about. I've seen... the seams between universes ripped apart, things that humans shouldn't see. People make up explanations... assign meaning to things without knowing, because it's reassuring. It's comforting. But I can't do that... because I know too much. It's all just numbers. And The Invaders, as you call them, they're just better at math than we are. Thank you for the magnet. Why are you smiling?\nSIMONE: Because I believe. You can't know everything.\nWALTER: More heat, Asner. I said more heat, not shut it. Peter.\nPETER: I need you to suture my shoulder, Walter.\nWALTER: I need my medical kit, disinfectant, and pain medication.\nASTRID: Got it.\nWALTER: How badly does it hurt?\nPETER: There is no pain.\nWALTER: I've discovered things, Peter... things you need to know. I've run a diagnostic simulation. The technology you've put inside yourself is in the process of... completely reshaping your brain. The areas that relate to emotion... are being commandeered to make room for more logical thought.\nPETER: Shrinking the nucleus accumbens in my limbic system, suppressing emotional memory in favor of higher rational thought, also expanding my Cerebral Cortex. I know. If you could see what I see, Walter... if you could experience what it feels like to fully harness the untapped potential of the human brain, you, of all people, should know that there is no reason to be afraid.\nWALTER: Are you also aware that the changes will soon be permanent? And if that happens, there's nothing I can do to get you back.\nPETER: I'm going to do this. I'm going to shift Windmark's future so that he passes through the Square at exactly 7:19 P.M. When he does, I will know that he has been reset onto the correct path.\nWALTER: I can't allow you to make that mistake.\nPETER: Don't you see, Walter? When he passes through the Square, she will be avenged.\nWALTER: We all want Windmark dead... but the plan outlined on the tapes is the way to do it. We need you, Son. I need you.\nPETER: I have to go.\nANIL: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: I got a truck and a magnet. I need someplace big enough to store them.\nANIL: We've got a warehouse outside the city. When you're close, I'll have someone meet you and guide you there.\nOLIVIA: Hey, listen, I\u2019m gonna call you back.\nBRIGGS: Hey! Don't move! Hands up! What do you got in the truck?\nOLIVIA: Nothing that you'd be interested in.\nBRIGGS: Got any money?\nOLIVIA: Nope.\nSTRATTON: You don't need money. You are money.\nSTRATTON: I\u2019m just saying... with the money we'll make from the truck and the scraps from the magnet, it's a pretty good score. Are you sure you want to get involved in this?\nBRIGGS: We could pull one hundred more jobs and not see this kind of money. Now give me your comm. Trust me, alright? I\u2019ve got it covered.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: Reward Wire. Do you have something to report?\nBRIGGS: I have a fugitive in custody.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: What is your location?\nBRIGGS: I don't want to tell you where I am. I want to meet at a Truth Church.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: This is unorthodox.\nBRIGGS: Yeah, well, I\u2019ve done things I don't want to be read for. So the only way this goes down is at a Truth Church, where you can't scan me. Once I get the money, I'll tell you where she is.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: What is the fugitive's name?\nBRIGGS: Olivia Dunham.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: Hold, please.\nLOYALIST AIDE: Reward Wire call. A man claims to have Olivia Dunham in custody. He wants the reward for her capture up front.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Acceptable.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: What is the closest Truth Church to your location?\nBRIGGS: There's one in Sector Seven. I can be there in an hour.\nHOTLINE OPERATOR: See that you are.\nBRIGGS: And that's how we roll. Huh? Come on. You used to be fun.\n(in the Observer precinct building in Manhattan, Peter has found his way to one of the electrical service bays in the heart of the structure. with a few tools, he pops the cover off of an electrical circuit box for an elevator and opens a wiring panel inside. after a quick check of the watch, to make sure his calculations work correctly, Peter snips a few specific wires to achieve the result he desires. upstairs in the office space, Windmark approaches an elevator for a ride to a different. after pressing the call button several times, with no resultant elevator, Windmark decides he'll take the stairs instead. Peter waits in the electrical room, looks up and visually hypothesizes he was successful in getting Windmark to take the stairs, then quickly reinstalls the panel cover and leaves))\nBRIGGS: What the hell is this?\nOLIVIA: Don't. Put your hands on your head.\nSTRATTON: Where's Briggs?\nWALTER: Olivia, where are you?\nOLIVIA: I'm on my way back to Boston. I've got the magnet. Anil's got a place where we can store it.\nWALTER: What happened to your face?\nOLIVIA: I'm a little banged-up, but I\u2019m okay, Walter.\nWALTER: Um, Olivia, Peter was here.\nOLIVIA: When?\nWALTER: A couple of hours ago. I tried to convince him. I said that his brain is being altered, and that soon it will be irreversible. But he won't hear me. I don't know what else to do.\nOLIVIA: Walter, do you know where he is?\nOLIVIA: Peter.\nPETER: Olivia.\nOLIVIA: Walter, told me about Windmark... that he almost killed you.\nPETER: I have already turned that to my advantage. See those steps down there? In a few minutes, if everything goes according to plan, Windmark will walk up those steps and pass that fountain. Then I will know that he has been reset onto the correct path. He does not realize it now, but he will be back on the trajectory that I want him on.\nOLIVIA: What trajectory is that?\nPETER: The trajectory that leads to his death. He killed our daughter. At exactly 5:12 tomorrow afternoon, I will meet him face-to-face. He will not expect it. He will not have a chance to fight back. At 5:13, I will snap his neck. At 5:14, he will draw his last breath.\nOLIVIA: Peter, I\u2019ve lost you before over this, and I\u2019m not gonna let that happen again. Now, your thinking is way ahead of mine - - I understand that. But the fact that I am here has got nothing to do with anything except feeling. And soon, you're not gonna be able to feel anything, Not for me, not for \u2018Etta.\nPETER: When I was fighting Windmark, he showed me \u2018Etta's last thoughts before he shot her. She thought of us... that day in the park before they invaded, before everything went wrong. Her last thoughts... they were of us. I will kill him tomorrow. If I remove the tech, I will not be able to do that. Don't you see?\nOLIVIA: And what if tomorrow is too late? What if that tech becomes permanent? \u2018Etta's not gone, Peter. Windmark didn't take her.\nPETER: Yes, he did.\nOLIVIA: No, he didn't. She's still here with us.\nPETER: She is dead.\nOLIVIA: She saved my life today with the bullet she brought to us. She's alive inside us. And there's nothing that Windmark can do about it, because the love that we can share with her now is invulnerable to space and time, even to them. And I know that our hearts are broken and that it hurts, But that's what makes us human.\nPETER: Emotion is our weakness.\nOLIVIA: No, Peter, it's our strength, because it's the one thing that they don't have. Now, we need to hold on to our connection with \u2018Etta, feeling what we felt for her, or she dies all over again. And we cannot let her be erased. Peter - - Peter, I\u2019m not asking you to abandon her. I'm asking you to hold on to her. You're not one of them. You're one of us. I want you to listen to me. I'm not gonna lose you again. Peter... Look at me. I love you. I love you."

Did you fix this radio? Because it's picking up a signal.\nWALTER: It's beautiful.\nOLIVIA: You okay?\nPETER: Yeah. Yeah, I just can't sleep.\nOLIVIA: How are you feeling?\nPETER: I had another one of those headaches.\nOLIVIA: Can I get you something?\nPETER: No. I got everything I need right here.\nASTRID: There's something you both need to see. The radio's working. The pattern's repeating on a loop. It's like it's some kind of Morse Code, but it's not Morse Code, or at least it's not any Morse Code that I\u2019ve ever heard.\nOLIVIA: So do you think maybe it's Donald?\nPETER: Why now? How would he even know that we're still alive?\nOLIVIA: Well, he left the radio for Walter for a reason, and he left it on that frequency for a reason. Maybe he's trying to contact us.\nPETER: Well, yeah, him or anybody else with a shortwave radio.\nOLIVIA: The only way to know for sure is to find out what that message is. Walter. Walter? Do you recognize this?\nASTRID: It's gonna be difficult to get any information from him right now because he dropped acid.\nPETER: Walter. Walter? Walter? Are you tripping?\nWALTER: Most definitely.\nPETER: Walter... I need to talk to you. Can you concentrate for a moment?\nWALTER: Carla Warren is here. My old dead lab assistant is here to haunt me. The one that was burned in the fire.\nPETER: The radio is picking up a transmission. We think it's from Donald. Do you recognize it?\nASTRID: Okay, I ran prelims on the transmission through my encryption program, just trying to figure out if there's some sort of pattern hidden in the beeps and tones, but I can't make heads or tails of it.\nPETER: Okay, Walter, if they're right and Donald did send you a message, it makes sense that he'd expect you to know it.\nWALTER: Right. Makes sense. Why send me a message I can't understand?\nPETER: So can you?\nWALTER: Hmm?\nPETER: Understand it?\nWALTER: It's in \"A\" minor. Peter, I'm sorry. I didn't know we were going to get a message. How could I know that? I wouldn't have taken the acid if I had known that.\nPETER: What kind of acid did you take?\nWALTER: Black Blotter. I found some hidden in the storeroom.\nPETER: Why?\nWALTER: Because it was an excellent batch.\nPETER: No, why did you drop acid?\nWALTER: I'm desperate to remember the plan before he completely takes over.\nPETER: Who are you talking about, Walter?\nWALTER: Nina and I made an arrangement.\nPETER: What kind of arrangement?\nWALTER: She promised that when I finished the plan to defeat the Observers, she would help me remove the pieces of brain that they put back in.\nPETER: I don't think that's a good idea, Walter.\nWALTER: I don't want to lose you, Peter. I don't want to lose any of you.\nPETER: And you won't, Walter. I'm right here. We're alright here together.\nWALTER: It's not enough. I'm afraid we're running out of time.\nOLIVIA: What do you mean, Walter?\nWALTER: Two nights ago, you were all asleep. I found myself at the tunnel entrance door, dressed and ready to go, to go outside. Out there. Where was I going at three in the morning, Peter? Where?\nPETER: I don't know, Walter.\nWALTER: And neither do I!\nCARLA WARREN: But he does.\nWALTER: But he does. He knows where I was going.\nOLIVIA: Who knows, Walter?\nPETER: The Walter that was.\nWALTER: I don't even remember what I was doing. It's like the first time I went out, but I stopped myself. But what if next time I didn't stop myself, couldn't stop myself, what then? I promised you, Peter, but he made me. What he almost made me. For reasons I do not know. I need to figure out this blasted plan to defeat the Observers, and I have to do it quickly to rid myself of this devil. There must be something they left intact, something I can use. Peter. Peter. Peter, I don't think I should be discussing this in my condition. You need to allow me to do my work. I need to think, to figure out the tones.\nPETER: Okay, come on.\nOLIVIA: What if we don't have to crack the code?\nASTRID: What do you mean?\nOLIVIA: The signal's coming from somewhere. If we track it, maybe we can figure out what it means. Peter, can we locate where this signal is being broadcast from?\nPETER: Well, I'll get in contact with Anil, see if The Resistance has a receiver that can help us triangulate the signal.\nWALTER: Thank you, my Dear.\nANIL: The tech works by isolating the frequency of the radio signal you're looking for. It locates the signal by using three different vectors to triangulate the signal.\nPETER: And we have to be at a certain elevation to track it?\nANIL: No, the machine does it for you, utilizing a satellite.\nPETER: Hey, Walter. We're about to find the signal's origin.\nWALTER: I know that.\nCARLA WARREN: Do you know that there's something hidden in this lab?\nPETER: Walter? Walter?\nANIL: What's wrong with him?\nWALTER: When did he get here?\nPETER: Half an hour ago. He brought the tech that's gonna help us track the signal's location.\nANIL: Let me set the parameters. Set those red geolocate buttons to accept.\nOLIVIA: Go back. I think that was it.\nPETER: We have to go on foot from here, but the transmission's definitely coming from that direction.\nOLIVIA: Well, how far out?\nPETER: Uh, it's hard to say, but the signal's still strong. I'm guessing not more than a couple hundred yards.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: You amaze me. After everything I\u2019ve put you through, I did the very thing I promised you I wouldn't do, I left you again. I'm more than a little embarrassed, you know?\nOLIVIA: Peter, you don't have to say anything.\nPETER: No, I do. I don't deserve you. I'm just so lucky, so incredibly lucky to have you.\nOLIVIA: Peter.\nPETER: It was an Observer.\nOLIVIA: Peter - there are two more over here. Another Observer and a Loyalist. Looks like they were killed during a firefight. Based on the decomp of their bodies, I'd say ten, fifteen years ago at least.\nPETER: I think we just found Donald. Liv, take a look at this. It's an early prototype Observer gun. Looks like he killed the two Observers and the Loyalist, but then died of his wounds before he could drive away.\nOLIVIA: Well, if Donald's been dead all these years, then where's the signal coming from?\nPETER: Right over there. Olivia! This isn't the source of the transmission. It's just a relay being used to boost the signal that's being bounced in from somewhere else. What is it?\nOLIVIA: The body behind the wheel, it isn't Donald. It's Sam Weiss.\nASTRID: Walter.\nWALTER: What is it?\nASTRID: Was there a man that was part of the plan named Sam Weiss?\nWALTER: Sam Weiss. I've never heard of him.\nASTRID: He doesn't know him. Who is he?\nOLIVIA: Uh, he was someone that Peter and I knew in a different time line.\nASTRID: Was?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, we just found his body. Looks like he was trying to protect the signal relay from the radio transmission.\nASTRID: But, what did he have to do with Donald and the signal?\nOLIVIA: We don't know, but apparently, he was helping to keep the transmission going.\nASTRID: Well, is there a possibility that Sam Weiss was Donald?\nOLIVIA: I don't think so. I mean, we've seen glimpses of Donald on the video tapes, and his hair color and body type just doesn't match up. Peter's recalibrating the tracking device so that we can find the signal's origin point. We'll call you back as soon as we have something new.\nASTRID: Yeah.\nCARLA WARREN: Okay, she won't see you now. You're still cold, Walter. Colder.\nWALTER: This is absurd. I haven't got time for infantile games. Just tell me what it is you have me looking for.\nCARLA WARREN: Your secrets.\nWALTER: I have no idea what you're talking about. And I can't begin to guess.\nCARLA WARREN: Can't? That word was never in the vocabulary of the Walter Bishop I knew. He once told me, There is no God in this lab but me.\nWALTER: He is not me. Tell her, Nina.\nNINA: He's right.\nCARLA WARREN: That Walter would think nothing of going off on his own to New York right now. He'd share all his secrets with the Observers, demonstrate his unequaled brilliance. A man of your staggering intellect and vision would be recognized by the Observers, valued, revered even. Grab your coat and hat.\nWALTER: Stop. I won't let you talk me into leaving the lab by myself again. I promised Peter! I will not jeopardize the plan. I won't risk the safety of everyone I care about.\nASTRID: Walter?\nCARLA WARREN: Warmer. You're burning up. And I know how that feels.\nWALTER: I don't understand. What is this?\nNINA: No, put it back, Walter.\nCARLA WARREN: It's your life's work, the work I came to burn the night that I died.\nWALTER: Perhaps just a peek.\nWALTER: Oh. This is my matter displacement invention for removing food from cans. I was going to render the can opener obsolete.\nCABBIE: Mister. I don't know if I can make change for this.\nWALTER: Try. Oh. And my design for the combustible engine powered by potatoes. What's Black Umbrella? Is that in here? What is Black Umbrella? Why is it in my head? Oh.\nWAITER: Would you care for a top off, sir? I have Purple Microdot, or would you like to stick with the Black Blotter?\nWALTER: I don't mind if I do.\nWAITER: Excellent choice, sir. Ah, when I crossed universes to save Peter, this is when I first realized how I could do it.\nCARLA WARREN: And do you remember anything else? When you were going to create your own universe and start from scratch?\nWALTER: I'm not who you say I am. I am not that man anymore. Where am I?\nCARLA WARREN: You're in Manhattan.\nWALTER: Manhattan?\nCARLA WARREN: At the Observer Precinct.\nWALTER: What am I doing here?\nCARLA WARREN: You snuck out of the lab, you tricked Astrid.\nWALTER: Why would I do that? I - I promised Peter. I promised that I wouldn't leave the lab alone again. I wouldn't make a unilateral decision like that. I wouldn't do something that could hurt the people I love.\nCARLA WARREN: You're in denial. You've been him longer than you've been you. Why else do you think I'm here? I'm just like this journal. I represent all of the things that you're trying to keep buried.\nWALTER: I wanted to cry for you. I'm different now.\nCARLA WARREN: It was a surgical procedure that made you the Walter you're clinging to, but you can't hide from who you are.\nWALTER: I've made a terrible mistake. I've risked everything. I've put everybody in jeopardy. I must find my way home.\nASTRID: Come on, Walter. We're waiting for you.\nWALTER: What are we doing here?\nASTRID: We're meeting Peter and Olivia. We have to rent a boat, remember?\nWALTER: Boat? Ooh.\nDOCKMAN: What's wrong with him?\nASTRID: He's fine.\nPETER: Here you go.\nDOCKMAN: It's at the end of the dock. But easy on the choke 'cause it'll flood the engine if you give it too much gas.\nPETER: Alright, let's go, Walter.\nWALTER: Why do we need a boat, Peter?\nPETER: Because we used the tech that Anil gave us to locate the origin point of Donald's signal.\nWALTER: Where's it coming from?\nPETER: There. That island. That's where we're going, Walter.\nWALTER: Is that where Donald is?\nPETER: We're going to find out.\nWALTER: Oh, my.\nOLIVIA: Watch your step, Walter.\nWALTER: What's wrong? What's happening?\nASTRID: Walter, it's okay. Just relax.\nWALTER: No, we have to -\nPETER: No. no, Walter. Just slow down. Slow down.\nLOYALIST PATROLMAN: Hey, you there.\nPETER: Afternoon.\nLOYALIST PATROLMAN: Hold up. That your boat?\nPETER: Yeah, we're just going down to visit my uncle.\nLOYALIST PATROLMAN: Your uncle?\nPETER: He lives out on Thimble Island.\nLOYALIST PATROLMAN: I'm gonna have to do a scan.\nPETER: Sure thing, no problem.\nLOYALIST PATROLMAN: You have papers?\nPETER: Yeah, right here.\nOLIVIA: Go.\nASTRID: Come on, Walter.\nWALTER: Why are these mice shooting at us?\nOLIVIA: Let's go.\nPETER: Based on the strength of the signal, we gotta be getting close.\nOLIVIA: Look, there's a path just over there.\nPETER: How you doing, Walter?\nASTRID: He's fine.\nPETER: This is where the signal originates.\nRICHARD: Who are you? What do you want?\nOLIVIA: We're here to meet Donald. Are you Donald?\nRICHARD: There's no Donald here.\nPETER: Have you ever seen this man before? You recognize him?\nRICHARD: I don't know who you are, but I suggest you turn around and go back where you came from.\nWALTER: Astrid. Do you see him? The child Observer.\nASTRID: Oh, my God.\nOLIVIA: It's him.\nCAROLYN: Richard? Who are these people?\nRICHARD: I have it under control, Carolyn. Go back inside.\nOLIVIA: We're here because of a man named Donald. You know him? He left a radio for us, and this morning it started transmitting a signal that led us here.\nCAROLYN: Put the gun down. Richard, we knew this day could happen, that one day someone would come for him.\nRICHARD: You said you picked up a radio transmission. Then you know it contained a message with a password.\nASTRID: But the message was in code. We couldn't crack it.\nRICHARD: Donald said the person he left the radio for would know the code. If you are who you say you are, tell me the password. Tell me the password.\nWALTER: Hmm. Ah! Huh? Ah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Huh? Aah! Black Umbrella. It's Black Umbrella. That's the password. Black Umbrella.\nCAROLYN: I think you better come inside.\nOLIVIA: You know Donald. So what can you tell us about him?\nRICHARD: When the Invaders came and people started to fight back, my wife and I helped the cause in any way we could. We gave food, supplies, medical attention, and shelter to those courageous enough to stand up against them.\nPETER: You were part of The Resistance.\nRICHARD: We didn't call ourselves that back then, but yes. After a while, we acquired a reputation as people who could be trusted. That's how we met Donald. About eight months after the invasion, he showed up at our doorstep. He said the Invaders were looking for him and he had to go away. But he needed us to watch over the boy. He said he was part of an important plan to defeat the Invaders. Donald said he'd worked with a scientist from Boston, but the scientist had been captured, he wasn't sure he'd ever see him again but that he hoped that he would.\nWALTER: That's me. Did Donald say where he was going?\nCAROLYN: No.\nPETER: And you never saw him again after that?\nRICHARD: That was part of the arrangement. He couldn't come back. He didn't want to put us in danger. We heard that he was dead.\nCAROLYN: Well before he left, he gave us this. We had to turn it on every five days at the same time, so it could broadcast a coded message. If you were still alive, you would get the message and come for the boy.\nRICHARD: That was over twenty years ago.\nCAROLYN: He doesn't speak. He hasn't aged a day since he came to live with us. We call him Michael.\nRICHARD: There were times when I thought about not turning that signal on anymore. Selfishly, I wanted to keep him here with us. This is the hardest day for me. I never doubted that Michael was important, that he was meant for something great.\nOLIVIA: Here. Something to warm you up. It's just hot cocoa. I had a daughter, and when she was little, she loved hot cocoa. She used to say, that of all the hot cocoa in the world, mine was her favorite. Do you know me? Do you remember me?\nPETER: But he met us in a different time line. How could he possibly remember you?\nOLIVIA: Observers experience time differently. Maybe he does too.\nCARLA WARREN: You can't hide from who you are. Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things are God's.\nWALTER: There's only room for one God in this lab, and it's not yours.\nELIZABETH BISHOP: God, I just can't bear it when you're not here.\nWALTER: You know what I'm doing, you know where I am, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. I won't give up, Elizabeth. I can do this. I need you not to doubt me. Nothing's going to happen to you. I promise.\nCARLA WARREN: Walter, you're trying to create a wormhole into another universe?\nWALTER: Yes. I think I just said that.\nCARLA WARREN: I'm sorry, but you can't.\nWALTER: Yes, I think I can.\nCARLA WARREN: No, Walter, I won't let you do it.\nNINA: Walter! No!\nWalter, there has to be a line somewhere. There has to be a line we can't cross.\nWALTER: My son is dying, Doctor Warren. I will not allow that to happen again.\nCARLA WARREN: I am become death, Destroyer of Worlds.\nWALTER: Don't you quote Oppenheimer.\nCARLA WARREN: Knowledge cannot be pursued without morality.\nWALTER: You sound like a sanctimonious southern preacher!\nCARLA WARREN: I may go to church every Sunday, Walter, but I also have three degrees in theoretical physics, and I am telling you - you cannot do this! We both know the amount of energy required to create a portal will forever ruin both universes. For the sake of one life, you will destroy the world. Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things are God's.\nWALTER: There's only room for one God in this lab, and it's not yours.\nCARLA WARREN: The journal doesn't matter. Even if you burn it, it's too late now that you remember all the things you're capable of.\nNINA: Walter, you got the boy back. You've got to continue. You've got to keep fighting.\nCARLA WARREN: I think we both know you're too tired to do that. There's nothing to burn. You've been him longer than you've been you."

Go on. It's good.\nOLIVIA: Michael, you used to write things down for me. You helped us catch a bad man. Do you remember that? Michael, you're very special, and there's a lot that we would like to learn about you.\nPETER: My father was working on a plan with a man named Donald. You were a very important part of that plan. Do you remember that?\nWALTER: You do, and you know me. We should just go into his mind, like we did with September.\nPETER: September was in a coma.\nWALTER: So we put him in one too.\nOLIVIA: We're not putting him in a coma.\nWALTER: Then, we put an electromagnetic probe into the base of his skull, and ply him full of Serotonin, Neurontin, and LSD.\nASTRID: Walter, he is just a child.\nWALTER: He is not just a child! He's more than a child. He is an integral part of my plan. He must know that! He's just not saying anything for some reason or other. You said yourself, he wrote things before. Why is he not doing that now? Who is Donald? Where is he? Is he alive? I must find him. Tell me.\nPETER: Hey! Walter, calm down.\nWALTER: How can I calm down, Peter? We're running out of time. Don't you understand? We got a world to save! Acid, get back to cutting out those tapes. We're not gonna get any answers out of him.\nOLIVIA: Peter, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, he's an empath. We used to have a connection. He used to feel what I wanted and then he'd communicate it to me. Now, it just seems like he can't.\nOLIVIA: Nina, it's Olivia.\nNINA: Is everything alright?\nOLIVIA: Nina, we need your help with something.\nNINA: What? It's not safe for me to talk here. Let me call you in ten minutes.\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: Can I help you?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You are a Loyalist. Then you know how important it is that you answer my questions. Where is your superior?\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: I'm not sure. She got a call a little while ago and then told me she was taking an early lunch.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Who was the call from?\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: It came in on her private comm.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: When did this occur?\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: About twenty minutes ago.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Bring an LQ-7 unit. We don't have much time. When is she expected to return?\nNINA'S ASSISTANT: She's always back by one o'clock.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Fugitives we are seeking recently used a Sublimation Device to access an abandoned storage facility. We have traced the device to the Ministry of Science. Someone here has supplied them with it, I suspect from this office. It is not you I am concerned with.\nNINA: This is Nina Sharp. Is everything alright? We've never seen one before. What? A child? A child Observer? We've never seen one before. It's not safe for me to talk here. Let me call you in ten minutes.\nOLIVIA: Nina, thank you so much for doing this. I know the risk you're taking.\nNINA: Nonsense. I'm nothing if I can't be a resource for you. Now, where is he? Hello. My name is Nina.\nWALTER: What are we doing here? I'm cold.\nNINA: I have access to tech that I think will be helpful for you to communicate with him. It's in a lab not far from here.\nPETER: A Ministry Lab? You think that's safe?\nNINA: Not a Ministry Lab. A Black Lab.\nOLIVIA: I thought Massive Dynamic Black Labs didn't exist.\nNINA: Well, I'm glad I can still surprise you. Since The Invasion, I've allowed it to be used by The Resistance.\nPETER: We should get going.\nNINA: How's Walter doing?\nPETER: Which one?\nNINA: Ah.\nPETER: He's vacillating lately. And he dropped acid yesterday, so that didn't exactly help.\nNINA: Well, he hasn't changed that much.\nPETER: He catches me off-guard. I look him in the eyes sometimes, and I see a stare that I don't recognize. He told me that you agreed to remove the pieces of his brain once he completed the plan to defeat the Observers.\nNINA: Never underestimate the power of incentive. You don't approve?\nPETER: What happens to him? After the tissue has been removed, what happens to Walter? How many times can a human brain endure something like that?\nNINA: Walter told me that that was a risk that he was willing to take.\nPETER: I don't accept that.\nNINA: You may not have to. If the plan isn't completed in time, he may regress completely and no longer want to go through with it.\nPETER: So what you're saying is I lose him either way?\nNINA: What I'm saying is that your father understands that anything worth fighting for comes with a cost.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Perhaps she has been alerted to our presence here.\nASSISTANT OBSERVER: It would not be the first time.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Every conspiracy has a network. I want to see the facility from which the Sublimation Device was taken.\nOLIVIA: It's okay.\nNINA: It's better if he stays back there for a moment.\nWALTER: The Resistance experimented on Observers here?\nNINA: Yes. Among other things, we wanted to understand how they were reading us. Perhaps create technology that would give us the same advantage.\nPETER: Did it work?\nNINA: No. We were only able to extract bits and pieces of data. Images, words in their conscious minds, but not enough to be useful. However, if you were able to communicate with the Observer child using neural stimulation once before, this technology might be able to help you do it again.\nPETER: You alright? You're thinking about her?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, every time I see one of those posters, my heart - jumps.\nPETER: Yeah, mine too.\nOLIVIA: It's hard to see her face, but at the same time, I want to. You ready in there?\nPETER: Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.\nNINA: Like ours, Observer brains translate external stimuli - - language, sights, sounds - - into patterns of electrical activity, which we commonly call thoughts.\nOLIVIA: Come on, Michael.\nNINA: This is an Electro-Cognitive translator. An ECog for short.\nOLIVIA: How does it work?\nNINA: By interpreting patterns of electrical activity into words and images that we can understand.\nPETER: Allowing you to read their thoughts.\nWALTER: For all intents and purposes, yes.\nWALTER: This will suffice. Prep the subject.\nPETER: His name's Michael.\nLOYALIST AIDE: Captain Windmark, we've been unable to locate Nina Sharp's comm device.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Continue looking. Mister Roe, we have determined that Nina Sharp is a traitor. She is working for The Resistance. Do you have any knowledge of that?\nROE: No.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Do you know where she is?\nROE: No.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I believe you.\nPETER: This is gonna be a little cold.\nOLIVIA: We're just gonna do a test, but it won't hurt. I promise.\nWALTER: His cortical activity is off the charts.\nNINA: The neural link is good. We're ready.\nOLIVIA: Okay. Michael, if at any point, you want to stop, you just squeeze my hand. Okay? Michael, do you remember why you're so important to Walter's plan?\nWALTER: His mind is responding to the question.\nNINA: Hmm. The ECog is attempting to translate his neural activity, but he's processing information in a way I've never seen before. This is not like any of the other Observers from our trials. The software can't interpret it.\nWALTER: Something has fundamentally changed with the subject. Michael. Whatever allowed us to communicate before is no longer viable.\nNINA: You said the boy formed a bond with Olivia, helped her solve a case once.\nOLIVIA: That's right.\nNINA: So he did so, because he knew what you wanted. He could feel it through the empathic connection with you. Maybe he can't help us now because that connection no longer exists.\nPETER: So you're saying he can't understand what we want?\nOLIVIA: So how can he help us?\nNINA: We've been trying to get into his mind. Maybe the answer is letting him get into ours.\nWALTER: Yes. That is brilliant, Nina. We need to create a link between one of our conscious minds and the boy's.\nOLIVIA: Well, how do we do that?\nNINA: Well, it's going to take some time, I have to reconfigure the ECog's software, and you've got to return to the warehouse at the Ministry of Science to get another ECog halo and a neural adaptor for the second person.\nPETER: Is that going to be a problem?\nNINA: No, I've got a man in Archives. He'll give us what we want.\nWALTER: Hastings?\nNINA: Yes.\nLOYALIST GUARD: Next. Name?\nDARRYL HASTINGS: Hastings, Darryl R.\nOLIVIA: I still can't get through to Hastings.\nWALTER: This is intolerable. Without the neural adaptor and the second E-C-O-G halo, we have no way to communicate with the boy.\nPETER: Don't worry, Walter. We'll get 'em.\nWALTER: Nina will have the pass code.\nOLIVIA: Well, her comm doesn't work underground, so there's no way to contact her. Do you think that we can bypass this?\nASTRID: Hey, guys.\nPETER: Astrid, I need your help breaking through a security lock.\nASTRID: I'm on it. Give me the model number.\nLOYALIST GUARD: Next.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: I'm a Quality Assurance engineer. I assess and maintain the technology warehoused in this facility. I don't report directly to Nina Sharp, but indirectly, sometimes I do.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Mister Hastings, we believe...\nDARRYL HASTINGS: ...Doctor. It's Doctor Hastings.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Doctor Hastings.\nASTRID: Okay, you're gonna want to take the brown wire from the pad and attach it to the comm's receiving node.\nPETER: Alright, the comm's attached.\nASTRID: Now, I'm going to send a continuous stream of data to your comm device. Hopefully, it'll be enough to short out the locking circuitry.\nWALTER: Hopefully? I thought she knew what she was doing.\nASTRID: Okay, I'm sending it now. You might want to step back.\nOLIVIA: Okay, we're in.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: We believe a Sublimation Device from this facility was provided to known fugitives. Are you aware of this?\nDARRYL HASTINGS: No.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I do not believe you. Restrain him. Dismiss the rest.\nWALTER: We may as well be looking for a needle in a haystack.\nPETER: No, it's all arranged according to serial number. Look. There's a terminal. Maybe we can access the database.\nWALTER: Can you run a search?\nPETER: Yeah. There. 18-C-6.\nWALTER: Up there, on the top shelf.\nOLIVIA: Windmark's here.\nPETER: What?\nOLIVIA: He's with Hastings.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: It was an outdated model. I didn't know what they were using it for.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You wanted to help them. You admire them. You admire Doctor Bishop.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: Yes. I admire him.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Where is Nina Sharp now?\nDARRYL HASTINGS: I swear, I don't know.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Where are the fugitives? Your loyalty will be rewarded.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: I don't know. I don't know.\nNINA: Michael, I need you to stay here. I'll be right back.\nLOYALIST SECURITY: There. That's her signal.\nWALTER: The components are intact.\nPETER: We got to get out of here, now.\nOLIVIA: It's Nina.\nNINA: Olivia, is everything alright?\nOLIVIA: Nina, I need you to listen to me. You've been compromised.\nNINA: What?\nOLIVIA: The Observers and Windmark are here. They're interrogating Hastings now. You can't come back to the Ministry, and you can't go home.\nNINA: It's okay. I have to go now.\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry.\nPETER: Okay, we're ready. Let's go.\nOLIVIA: Wait. They're gone. A guard just came in and told Windmark something, and then they left.\nLOYALIST THUG: We're going to make an example out of you.\nOLIVIA: My thoughts exactly.\nPETER: Doctor Hastings, can you hear me?\nDARRYL HASTINGS: I tried. I tried.\nOLIVIA: It's okay.\nDARRYL HASTINGS: He knows.\nWALTER: What? What does Windmark know?\nDARRYL HASTINGS: Nina, they tracked her. They know where she is.\nNINA: It's okay. Everything's going to be fine. I'm just... it doesn't matter. There's nothing for you to worry about. Oh, my God. Michael, come with me, quickly.\nWALTER: What's wrong? Why are we stopping?\nPETER: Checkpoint.\nOLIVIA: We need to turn around.\nPETER: If I back up now, I turn around, we're gonna draw too much attention. We need to ditch the car. One at a time. Walter, you first. Get out now. Okay, go.\nLOYALIST INSPECTOR: It's clear. They can go.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Find them.\nNINA: Captain Windmark.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: The fugitives. Where are they?\nNINA: You're too late. They're long gone.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You are trying to protect them. What is it about the fugitives, I wonder, that instills such misguided loyalty? You are trying to block your thoughts from me, but it will not last. You... animals. You are thinking of him. The Boy. This morning, you were contacted in your office. You said something about a child Observer. He is important to the fugitives. Why is he important to them? What is his purpose?\nNINA: Why does a child worry you so much?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: He is merely a curiosity, and you are mistaken about him. He is no child. He is a chromosomal mistake. A genetic anomaly. Designate: Progeny XB-6783746. Like all anomalies, he was scheduled to be destroyed. But he went missing. It was a great mystery in my time. No one knew what became of him... until now. I would very much like to meet him. Tell me where he is.\nLOYALIST AIDE: Captain Windmark? There's no sign of anyone else here.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Then I will have to resort to a deeper extraction. Why?\nNINA: Why?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Why are you not frightened?\nNINA: Do you know why you tilt your head in that way? It's an involuntary reflex in your physiology. It changes the angle at which sound waves hit the eardrum, allowing in more stimuli. Like a lizard. I've studied them too. Intriguing characters. Their brains have evolved over 320 million years, yet for all their evolution, they form no bonds. Love does not exist for them. They are incapable of dreaming, of contemplating beauty, of knowing something greater than themselves... not unlike your kind. The experiments we conducted right here in this lab, yielded a surprising result, because for all your years of evolution, you inadvertently redeveloped and honed primitive instincts that we moved beyond long ago. So in reality, you're the animal.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Restrain her. You cannot hurt me with that.\nNINA: I know.\nPETER: Walter, maybe you should stay in the van.\nWALTER: I'm coming with you. Nina? They've got the boy. Who knows what they'll do to him. What did he do to her?\nOLIVIA: Where's she going?\nPETER: She stopped Windmark from reading her.\nWALTER: To protect us. To protect the plan.\nOLIVIA: And to protect the boy. They left without him. He's still here. Michael?\nWALTER: Michael?\nPETER: Michael, you can come out now! It's safe!\nOLIVIA: Michael! Michael? Michael. Peter! You alright? It's okay. Michael?\nWALTER: He's crying.\nPETER: You ready?\nASTRID: Yeah.\nWALTER: If you understand me, touch your nose. Good. That's very good. Do you remember meeting me a long time ago, with a man named Donald? He does. He remembers. Do you know why I needed you for my plan? Can you tell me why you are important?\nTHE OBSERVER: The boy is important. He has to live.\nPETER: What happened?\nWALTER: I know who Donald is. Donald is September."

Let's get started.\nOLIVIA: Okay, his vitals are steady. His heart rate's a little low. I think that's just the sedative kicking in.\nASTRID: Oscillation's coming through clear. Everything seems to be functioning.\nPETER: Walter, you're good to go. You should be feeling pretty relaxed by now.\nOLIVIA: His blood pressure's rising.\nPETER: How much?\nOLIVIA: It's 140 over 90. No, 152 over 100. It's still rising.\nASTRID: His brain waves are fluctuating.\nPETER: Walter, your vitals are spiking. Are you okay?\nWALTER: Incredible. I\u2019m here.\nPETER: Walter, where are you?\nWALTER: An apartment... the same one from the flashes the boy showed me.\nPETER: Take a look around. You recognize anything about the space? Anything that could help us tell where it is?\nWALTER: I'm with September, and he doesn't look at all like himself. He has hair.\nPETER: Are there any windows?\nWALTER: Yes.\nPETER: Well, go take a look outside.\nWALTER: I see water... buildings in the distance... skyscrapers.\nPETER: Uh, New York?\nWALTER: Could be. Yes. I see the top of the Empire State Building.\nASTRID: The Empire State Building's the East Side of Manhattan.\nWALTER: To my right... I can't quite make - - a bridge. I'm under a bridge.\nASTRID: I think it's the Williamsburg Bridge. Based on the angle of the view that Walter described, I would say that the building is in Brooklyn, somewhere near the Southeast base of where the bridge used to be.\nPETER: So if September's still alive, and he's still living in the same place, that's where we find him.\nWALTER: He's still alive.\nOLIVIA: How do you know?\nWALTER: I'm optimistic.\nPETER: You are?\nWALTER: Why not? As to whether September is still living in the same place, we shall see. We must hurry.\nRECORDED NINA: Is everything alright? What? A child Observer? We've never seen one before. What? A child Observer? We've never seen one before.\nLIEUTENANT OBSERVER: We have received word. He is ready to see you now.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Continue searching for the fugitives. Alert me to any developments.\nWALTER: There. It was from over there.\nPETER: Wh - - hey. Hey, hey, what's going on with you?\nWALTER: What do you mean? I feel good.\nPETER: From where I\u2019m standing, you don't seem good, you seem amazing, which is a little scary.\nWALTER: I wouldn't worry about me.\nPETER: How can I not? You asked me to help you stay grounded. You were so afraid of becoming the man that you used to be, you asked Nina to remove pieces of your brain. Again.\nWALTER: It's alright, Son. The procedure is no longer necessary.\nPETER: But wh - - Walter, why? What's changed?\nWALTER: I can't explain it, but... when the boy touched me, he showed me more than just images. It was freeing, Peter. All at once, I understood that everything I\u2019ve ever known - - or thought I knew, as a great man - - could fit into a thimble. And that's not all he gave me. I remember things, things I haven't experienced. I think, from the other timeline, before you were erased, before the timeline was reset. I remember when you came to me at Saint Claire's. My first words: I thought you'd be fatter. And I remember the night I was up late, making a peanut butter sandwich, and you slipped and called me 'Dad'. The feeling of joy that gave me... and the terror, before you stepped into the Machine. I told you I\u2019ve never been good at letting you go, and you said...\nPETER: ... this time, you're gonna have to.\nWALTER: Hmm.\nPETER: What is this boy? How could he do this for you - - enable you to see a life you didn't live?\nWALTER: I'm not sure, but I feel it.\nPETER: Do you remember the plan?\nWALTER: No. No idea.\nPETER: But that doesn't make any sense. Why would he give you back all of those memories, but not give you the plan?\nWALTER: I don't know. Peter, before I met him, I didn't think it was possible to love you more, but now, knowing what we've been through, and everything we've had... I do. (bro hug) You never liked public displays of affection. Or going Number Two in a public restroom. I remember that too.\nCOMMANDER'S AIDE: The Commander awaits.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Anomaly XB-6783746 has been found. It is being hidden in 2036.\nCOMMANDER: For what purpose?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: That is not yet clear, but whoever hid this Anomaly did so for a reason. It should not exist, but someone wanted it to exist. Someone ensured its survival, because they thought it was important.\nWALTER: This is it. This is the window I was looking out in my vision from the tank. Here it is!\nSEPTEMBER: Walter Bishop. You're alive.\nWALTER: We were trapped in Amber. For twenty-one years, we were frozen in time.\nSEPTEMBER: I never thought I'd see you again.\nSEPTEMBER: How did you find me?\nPETER: We've been relying on the tapes that Walter made in 2015, trying to piece things together.\nWALTER: We found the radio that you left in the pocket universe, and that led us to the boy, and he showed me where to find you.\nOLIVIA: The couple that you left him with called him Michael.\nWALTER: It's been quite a journey.\nPETER: We've lost a lot. A lot of good people sacrificed themselves to get us to you.\nWALTER: So - your turn. What happened to you?\nSEPTEMBER: Before The Invasion, I was apprehended for my continued interference in the timeline, and my interaction with all of you. As punishment, they removed my device. Now, I\u2019m no longer able to move through time or do the things that I was able to do. They experimented on me. They called it biological reversion. Now, I am no different from you. Truthfully, it wasn't much of a punishment. I've always held this era in the highest regard.\nWALTER: And why the name Donald?\nSEPTEMBER: You really don't remember, do you? The first movie we watched together was Singin' In The Rain, and I chose the name Donald O'Connor.\nWALTER: Yes! It was an excellent movie. I used to sing Make 'Em Laugh - - wonderfully - - in the key of \"A\" minor.\nSEPTEMBER: I remember.\nWALTER: What is he?\nSEPTEMBER: He was born hundreds of years from now. Like all of our kind, he was created in a lab, using the genetic material of a designated donor. It was a process that began generations earlier, with a discovery on February 20th, 2167, by a scientist in Oslo, Norway, who was trying to find ways to increase human intelligence. He realized that if he could rewire the portion of the human brain that induces jealousy, he could increase cognitive function, sacrificing emotion for intelligence. This discovery was the catalyst of the creation of the beings that you called Observers, and his work carried on, and more and more emotions were seen as roadblocks to higher intelligence. Things like anger, greed, aggression, they were abandoned in the pursuit of intellect. Eventually, Humanity became so intelligent and efficient, they lost perspective of the value of these emotions - - Not only the negative ones, but the positive as well, and soon empathy, compassion, and love became messy distractions, and they too were machined out, and without romantic love, they developed new reproductive technologies.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I require data on an Anomaly.\nOBSERVER SCIENTIST: Which Progeny is it?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Anomaly XB-6783746.\nSEPTEMBER: Early in the boy's maturation, the scientists in charge of reproduction, realized that his brain had developed differently from other offspring. Its maturation was halted. To them, he was an anomaly, a defect.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Whose genetic material was used to create this progeny?\nSEPTEMBER: I had observed, in your time, how fathers cared for their sons and protected them. It stirred something in me that I could not ignore. I took the boy away, and hid him in the past, where he would be safe.\nWALTER: He's your Son?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: His name was September. He was part of the original twelve science team that traveled back in time to observe primitive humanity. He was banished for sympathizing with the fugitives I am tracking... the same fugitives who are in possession of the Anomaly.\nCOMMANDER: Why would he go to such lengths to protect a genetic defect?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I do not know. I would like a Protocol Suspension to travel back to a moment when I can eradicate these Resistors.\nCOMMANDER: No. We are not prepared to deal with a readjustment of probabilities. They disquiet you. The fugitives are inconsequential. He poses minimal risk. We chose this time in history for a reason. A 99.9999 per cent probability that we will succeed.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: The boy had a 0.0001 per cent chance of surviving, yet he did.\nCOMMANDER: Is there something wrong with you?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I am experiencing something that I do not understand. The idea of ending their existence... consumes me.\nCOMMANDER: They are insignificant. So no.\nPETER: So how does he fit into the plan?\nSEPTEMBER: They were right about him. He is an anomaly, but he's not less than them. He's more. At first, I thought his abilities were just empathic, but they developed into something greater. I now know that his intellect functions on a level that neither you nor we are capable of understanding, but what's more important, he has the emotions, the compassion, the empathy.\nWALTER: A hybrid?\nSEPTEMBER: Yes. That moment that I told you about, when scientists first decided to sacrifice human emotion to increase intelligence, that was the turning point in human evolution.\nOLIVIA: 20th of February, 2167.\nSEPTEMBER: If we can send the boy into the future to that moment, he can demonstrate to those scientists a different kind of intelligence, an enlightenment that goes beyond knowledge or cognition to something greater, and when they see what he is, when they study him, they will realize all that he is: Living proof that they don't have to sacrifice emotion for intelligence, and they will never go down that path.\nPETER: And the Observers will never exist. They will never invade.\nWALTER: That was the plan that we were working on before I Ambered us.\nSEPTEMBER: I always knew the boy was important, but when I realized why - - what he was supposed to do, my device had been removed. I'd lost the ability to move through time, so I came to you. That was the plan. We were going to send the boy forward into time. How far have you come with the tapes?\nPETER: We have the rocks from the mine in Pennsylvania, the magnet, the Observer Beacons, and some scrolls of physics that none of us can decipher.\nSEPTEMBER: Don't worry. I can help you with that.\nWALTER: These things we've collected, how they can possibly be used to travel through time?\nSEPTEMBER: They are part of a device that we must build.\nWALTER: I have the hologram blueprints.\nSEPTEMBER: It also requires technology that hasn't been invented, from my time.\nPETER: How do we get it?\nSEPTEMBER: I took them from the future long ago, the tech is hidden. It's not far from here.\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: Peter, I think we're gonna get our daughter back.\nPETER: Liv - -\nOLIVIA: You heard September. the plan is gonna reset time. Peter, that boy in there, he's how we're going to see \u2018Etta again. You don't believe me?\nPETER: I want to believe that more than anything, but we've still got a long way to go.\nASSISTANT OBSERVER: After the invasion, September was detained at a mine in Pennsylvania. He was extracting rocks. The purpose of the rocks was not ascertained.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: What was the outcome?\nASSISTANT OBSERVER: He was questioned and released. He was labeled a known offender.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Then he has been tagged. Initiate Location Protocol. Find his address.\nASSISTANT OBSERVER: Chip number 784651.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Search the apartment.\nASSISTANT OBSERVER: He has mostly likely removed his chip and destroyed it. That is why we could not track it.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: It is still warm. He was just here. Have the Loyalists review the footage from the surveillance cameras in the area. I want to know where he went.\nPETER: Which one is it?\nWALTER: You and Olivia stay here with Michael. Donald and I will get the tech.\nSEPTEMBER: They're in my home.\nWALTER: You can't go back there.\nSEPTEMBER: There is no back there.\n(Windmark stands and assesses September's music and one of his associates joins him. Windmark looks down at his subordinate's foot is tapping in time with the music on the oak floor. the two share a brief glance of ignorance and realize a flashing green light over the door suddenly turns red. a small light bomb in the apartment detonates and both men transit a trans-dimensional portal to the street below before being engulfed by the explosion)\nLOYALIST AIDE: Captain Windmark. A traffic camera on Front Street recorded this. We're putting the description of the vehicle out to all the units.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: The child is with them. That was fourteen minutes ago. They cannot have gone far. Set up a perimeter.\nSEPTEMBER: Here they are, just as I left them. What?\nWALTER: The boy, he communicated to me when he touched me.\nSEPTEMBER: What did he show you?\nWALTER: He gave me an awareness of another timeline when you saved Peter and I from Reiden Lake. When you pulled us from the lake, you said, The boy is important. He must live. You weren't referring to my son. You were referring to yours.\nSEPTEMBER: Yes. Did he show you anything else?\nWALTER: Yes. There is one thing I haven't told the others. He showed me that, for the plan to work, I would have to sacrifice myself. Is that right?\nSEPTEMBER: Yes. Are you frightened?\nWALTER: I would be lying if I said I wasn't frightened. Do you think that the boy showed me all these other experiences, because he wanted me to know that I have loved, that I have had incredible moments and connections? Because... because it will make it easier for me to come to terms with what I have to do? You think that's why he did it?\nSEPTEMBER: I don't know. It was your decision to sacrifice yourself for the plan. Do you remember that?\nWALTER: No.\nSEPTEMBER: You said you had caused so much unintended damage, you felt this was your chance to make amends. You would not have it any other way. Do you remember getting a white tulip?\nWALTER: Yes, I do. It was a sign from God.\nSEPTEMBER: The tulip was important. I took it from the other timeline, and kept it. When we devised the plan to stop The Invasion, you didn't think we could succeed. You doubted yourself. I knew the tulip would give you strength, as it had before. It was your symbol of hope and absolution. It gave you the courage to push on. At that time, I needed to give you back the hope that we could win.\nWALTER: I could use that tulip right now. Where is it?\nSEPTEMBER: I don't know what you did with it. Only you would know that.\nPETER: Is that it?\nSEPTEMBER: You say that as though we're not carrying technology that can bend space and time into a M\u00f6bius Strip. I'm not coming with you. I have a few more things we'll need before we get started on the plan.\nWALTER: Be careful.\nSEPTEMBER: You too. I will see you again. I promise.\nOLIVIA: I used to love Brooklyn.\nPETER: We need another route\nOLIVIA: We came this way less than thirty minutes ago, the checkpoint wasn't there. Try the alley. Astrid, it's me.\nASTRID: Hey. Did you find Donald?\nOLIVIA: Yeah, but somebody else found us. They're setting up roadblocks, and we need to find a way out.\nASTRID: Where are you?\nOLIVIA: We're parked in an alley at Adams and Tillary. Can you use the Resistance Network? See if you can hack into any live camera feeds in the area?\nASTRID: Yeah, I\u2019m accessing it now. Okay, I got it. Just pulling up the feeds. You're right, they're setting up a perimeter all around you. There's no way out.\nOLIVIA: We're surrounded.\nWALTER: Do you think they found Donald? Do you think he made it out?\nPETER: I don't know, Walter.\nWALTER: Well, we can't leave him.\nPETER: We don't have a choice. He said he'd contact us.\nOLIVIA: Hey, Astrid, has anything changed? Are they still holding the perimeter?\nASTRID: Hey, listen, I think I found a hole, but you have to move quick. The Monorail's your best bet. When you cross York, head South. There's a stop four blocks down, near Jay Street.\nOLIVIA: Okay, any activity there?\nASTRID: Nope, not that I can see.\nOLIVIA: Thanks. Astrid said that we should head toward Jay Street. There's a Monorail station. She said it's clear.\nPETER: It won't stay that way for long. hang here for a sec. They set up another checkpoint, further down. We're blocked.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I think we should split up. I'm gonna take Michael with me. A mother and child shouldn't draw too much suspicion. You're gonna stay with me, okay?\nCHECKPOINT CHATTER: Yeah, he's clear. Go ahead. Hold it right there.\nPETER: Just keep going. You're doing great. We're right behind you.\nWALTER: Peter.\nPETER: Yeah, I see 'em. No, I see 'em. Just keep moving. get to the Monorail. We'll be right there.\nOLIVIA: Okay, be careful.\nCHECKPOINT CHATTER: Keep moving, please. Pedestrians, keep moving.\nPETER: We're good. Let's go. Hey.\nOLIVIA: The train's leaving in a few minutes. Where are you?\nPETER: Not far.\nOLIVIA: They're searching cars.\nPETER: Don't worry. We'll meet you at the train.\nOLIVIA: I see you. We're in the second car.\nPETER: This way, Walter. Go into the first car. On your right. now. We're on board. We'll make our way to you.\nOLIVIA: They're coming to my car. I think they're gonna search it.\nPUBLIC ADDRESS: Ladies and Gentlemen, please have your papers ready for inspection.\nOLIVIA: Michael. Michael? Michael!\nPETER: Where's Michael?\nOLIVIA: He's gone. He just walked off the train.\nPETER: What?\nLOYALIST ENFORCER: Captain.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Hello."

I can track the convoy that's transporting the boy to Jay Street, and then they just fall right off the grid. I mean, I can't even track them on satellites.\nWALTER: Keep trying. Where the devil is Donald? Why did we agree to let him contact us?\nPETER: 'Cause we didn't know we were gonna lose Michael.\nWALTER: Well, what if he knows how to communicate with the boy or has a way of finding him?\nPETER: Well, when he gets back with the tech, we'll find out.\nOLIVIA: Well, we need to find him before Windmark figures out that he's the key to the plan.\nPETER: Call him again.\nBROYLES: Lieutenant.\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: I'm sorry, I\u2019m running late for a meeting.\nBROYLES: So am I. A high-value detainee was taken into custody last night. I need to know where he's being held.\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: I'm under strict orders not to disclose that information.\nBROYLES: I understand. Word came down that my Division is to supply reinforced security.\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: I wasn't informed of that.\nBROYLES: Well, I\u2019m informing you now. There's supposed to be a measure of cooperation between our departments, Lieutenant, or have you forgotten that?\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: Agent, there's a change in protocol after the security breaches from within.\nBROYLES: Lieutenant... are you suggesting that I might be The Dove? I'm more of a raven, don't you think?\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: Yeah. Right. Detention Camp 17, East Wing - - Liberty Island.\nBROYLES: Thank you.\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: Who is the detainee, anyway?\nBROYLES: Hell if I know.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I am intrigued by you, Anomaly XB-6783746. It is in your interest to communicate with me. The people you were with, what did they want with you? You are of significance to them. What is your purpose? Tell me about September... the one who hid you. Why did he hide you? To what end? The fugitives have a plan. Tell me about the plan. How does it involve you? Run complete and thorough diagnostics. Find out what it is.\nPETER: Broyles. Did you find him?\nBROYLES: Yes, but the news isn't good. They're holding him at a detention facility on Liberty Island. I'm uploading the schematic to you now.\nASTRID: Okay, I got it.\nWALTER: It looks like a fortress.\nBROYLES: It is. The towers are manned around the clock. And inside the complex, you're dealing with at least five layers of security.\nOLIVIA: Can you get us in?\nBROYLES: I don't have the clearance.\nPETER: Where exactly are they keeping him?\nBROYLES: The East Wing... in what they call their Neurological Research Unit.\nWALTER: They're going to experiment on him.\nBROYLES: Most likely, yes. Or worse.\nPETER: No building is impenetrable. How do we get in?\nBROYLES: I could get you a boat. But there are sensors located around the perimeter monitoring all movement.\nASTRID: Well, what if I could hack into the system and disable them remotely?\nBROYLES: They have multiple redundant alarm systems. If one is tampered with, the others automatically lock the place down.\nOLIVIA: We need an end run. We need to bypass security altogether.\nPETER: How?\nOLIVIA: The other side?\nASTRID: The other side of what?\nPETER: You mean the alternate universe?\nOLIVIA: What if the island is accessible from over there? If I can find the right location, then I can cross over, grab Michael from underneath them, and then bring him back with me.\nASTRID: But Walter said that the Cortexiphan burned out of your system. Without that, you no longer have the ability to cross over.\nOLIVIA: Maybe there's a way I can get it back.\nWALTER: Perhaps she can.\nPETER: How do we even know if the Cortexiphan is still good?\nWALTER: It has a shelf life of 127 years. Belly made sure of it.\nASTRID: But, Walter, how do we know that this is gonna work? When you ran the Trials, you gave Olivia controlled doses over an extended period.\nWALTER: That's true, but Olivia's treatment created a unique network of neural pathways in the brain. They may have atrophied through disuse, but a sudden jolt of Cortexiphan could reactivate them, temporarily at least.\nOLIVIA: 'Temporarily'? Well how long would I have?\nWALTER: I - I don't know. I'll have to calibrate that once I've determined just how massive a dose I can safely give you.\nPETER: How can a massive dose possibly be safe, Walter? The side effects of Cortexiphan have always been unpredictable. Can you honestly tell me that you know exactly how she'd react?\nWALTER: I don't know. I think...\nPETER: ...Could it give her seizures?\nWALTER: Possibly.\nPETER: Could it stop her heart?\nWALTER: There's a chance of that, yes.\nPETER: Could it cause her to phase in and out, disappear entirely, burst into flames?\nWALTER: Those are the risks, yes. I'll do all I can to mitigate it, but I cannot eliminate them altogether.\nPETER: No, it's too dangerous.\nOLIVIA: Peter. What other choice do we have? We can't let anything happen to him. \u2018Etta died so that we could finish the plan. Both feet in. That's what we said.\nPETER: And what if I lose you too? What then?\nOLIVIA: I can do this... and without him... we lose everything.\nPETER: Alright, let's say that you could cross over. What then? We have no idea what you'd find over there.\nOLIVIA: We know their Department of Defense was on Liberty Island.\nPETER: It was on Liberty Island. We closed that bridge twenty-four years ago. For all we know, the Observers could have invaded over there as well. We have no way of knowing what happened.\nASTRID: Not necessarily. The Universe Window. Why don't we just have a look?\nWALTER: Of course. That's brilliant, Asgard. Ha! Peter. Help us with the window.\nSCIENTIST #1: The paralytic will render him motionless from the neck down, assuring there will be no interference with our diagnostics.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Alert me when you have the results.\nPETER: Whoa, whoa. We got a Loyalist. Alright, she's gone.\nASTRID: You ready for the window?\nWALTER: Yes.\nASTRID: Hey, Walter? Make sure that you...\nWALTER: ...Aaah! (zapped) Fudge sticks.\nASTRID: Plug the other one in first.\nWALTER: There. Peter. Olivia. The moment of truth.\nPETER: It's working.\nOLIVIA: Call Anil - - we're gonna need a safe house and medical equipment.\nWALTER: Isn't she beautiful?\nSEPTEMBER: Hello? Walter?\nRESISTANCE FIGHTER: It's this way. This is Tobin. He's our field surgeon. He'll assist you in whatever way he can.\nTOBIN: Doctor Bishop. I got the items you requested.\nWALTER: I asked for a defibrillator.\nTOBIN: I wasn't able to secure one in time. In case of cardiac arrest, I do have this - - Adrenaline.\nWALTER: It's riskier. But it will have to suffice. We must get started. For the Cortexiphan to take effect quickly, it has to be injected directly into the brain stem in the back of your neck.\nOLIVIA: I'm okay.\nWALTER: Ready for the first dose?\nOLIVIA: Okay.\nWALTER: Okay. One, two...\nASTRID: Her heart rate is elevated, Walter -- 160 bpm and rising.\nPETER: Liv?\nOLIVIA: I'm okay. Let's keep going.\nWALTER: Take a deep breath. And exhale.\nASTRID: Heart rate is 180 bpm, Walter.\nPETER: Olivia? Hey. Liv, Honey, look at me. Olivia? Honey, look at me.\nOLIVIA: Peter.\nPETER: Olivia. Walter, she can't see me.\nTOBIN: She's at 200 bpm. You have to stop this.\nWALTER: I have to elevate her heart rate. You don't know what you're talking about.\nTOBIN: I may not know what you're doing, but I know enough about the human body to see that you might kill this woman!\nWALTER: Hold her down, son.\nPETER: I've got you.\nWALTER: I created Cortexiphan. There is no better authority.\nPETER: Okay, that's enough. Enough!\nWALTER: One more. Come on. She needs all four.\nPETER: Walter, I said that's enough.\nWALTER: She has to cross over four times. Do you want to leave her stranded on the other side? Trust me.\nSCIENTIST #2: There is an uncharacteristic development in the brain's emotional centers.\nSCIENTIST #1: This is not normal. The limbic system is vestigial, and yet his is substantially enlarged.\nSCIENTIST #2: It has sent tendrils into the brain's cognitive center, integrating emotional and intellectual activity to an extent that we previously deemed impossible.\nSCIENTIST #1: I will make the report.\nWALTER: Sacrifice is hard, son, but you're no stranger to it.\nPETER: Neither are you, Dad. You've sacrificed a lot.\nWALTER: Peter...\nPETER: What is it?\nWALTER: You're very strong, Son. Come. Let's wake her up. Olivia? Olivia?\nOLIVIA: (dream state) Peter, I think we're gonna get our daughter back. The plan is gonna reset time.\nWALTER: Olivia?\nPETER: How you feeling?\nASTRID: Can I get you some water?\nOLIVIA: No, thank you. I\u2019m fine. Have you figured out how long I've got before it wears off?\nWALTER: To be safe, approximately three and a half hours from the time of your last injection. Any longer than that, and, uh... you may become stranded. I've set this watch accordingly. And something else - - with every jump, a significant amount of the drug will be burned up in your system. If it burns up too fast, you may experience symptoms of withdrawal - - disorientation, hallucinations, lapses in time. If this occurs, you must cross back immediately. It is of paramount importance that you do this.\nOLIVIA: I understand.\nWALTER: Are you experiencing any dizziness, headache?\nOLIVIA: From the Cortexiphan, or from the light that you keep shining in my eyes?\nWALTER: Be careful, Dear.\nOLIVIA: I will, Walter.\nASTRID: We'll be waiting for you at Battery Park when you cross back over.\nPETER: So, assuming Fringe Division is still in the same location when you cross over, you should be right in front of it. Are you sure you can find her?\nOLIVIA: I think she'll probably find me.\nPETER: You're coming back. You're coming back with the boy... for \u2018Etta. I love you.\nOLIVIA: I love you too.\nFRINGE TECHNICIAN: We've got a breach.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Dunham.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Olivia?\nOLIVIA: It's me. I was in Amber for -- for twenty-one years.\nAGENT LEE: What are you doing here?\nOLIVIA: I need your help.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So, once you were Ambered, how did you get out?\nOLIVIA: Our daughter freed us.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So you found her? I can't imagine what you went through.\nAGENT LEE: Liv?\nOLIVIA: I'm sorry. What was I saying?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: That you were hoping you were going to see 'Etta again.\nAGENT LEE: If the plan is successful. Are you okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah. I don't have much time.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: So the boy is being held at a detention camp on Liberty Island?\nOLIVIA: On our side, yes. So my goal is to cross over, grab him, and then bring him back over here. Then we'll cross back home through Battery Park.\nAGENT LEE: I'll arrange the transport to Liberty Island.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: A lot's changed since you've been here.\nOLIVIA: Yeah, I can see that.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Are you sure you're okay?\nOLIVIA: Yeah.\n(September moves forward with assembling the device intended to defeat the Observers. several cylinders of lime green liquid refined from the strange quartz ore are added to the growing apparatus. a reactor core to activate the device is inserted and tested for functionality. the system powers-up and displays maximum capacity is possible, but then the reactor slowly decays and fails. a replacement core is needed.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: The deformity of the Anomaly's brain has resulted in profound neurological changes.\nCOMMANDER: In what respect?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: It has developed an intellect more advanced than our own and a capacity for emotional responsiveness far greater than the native humans.\nCOMMANDER: Curious. How is this possible?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Unknown. It possesses capabilities our diagnostic instruments cannot measure and that we are... unable to comprehend.\nCOMMANDER: That is very troubling.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I believe the fugitives intend to use the anomaly as a means to our destruction.\nCOMMANDER: It would be to our evolutionary advantage to continue to study it further.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: A more prudent path is to destroy it. There is no greater danger than that which is unknown.\nCOMMANDER: It is irrelevant whether the anomaly lives or dies. What is valuable is understanding what it was. Disassemble it. Preserve the pieces.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, I\u2019m gonna go check the schematics at the Facilities Office. I'll be right back.\nAGENT LEE: It is so good to see you.\nOLIVIA: You too. What about Walternate?\nAGENT LEE: He retired from the D.o.D. about twenty years ago, moved back to Boston. He's ninety years old and he still lectures at Harvard. Can you believe that? It's crazy... how life works out.\nOLIVIA: It's okay. I made my choices. You made yours. I don't regret any of them and neither should you. You deserve all the happiness that you got.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Okay, this way. You can stop checking out my young ass.\nOLIVIA: This is it?\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: If your coordinates are right, yeah, this is the same location as the room that they're holding the boy on your side. We'll be here when you get back with him. Hey... this will work.\nOLIVIA: I got to go.\n(Olivia successfully makes it back to her universe, but Michael is not at the specified coordinates. cranial diagnostics from Michael's testing are on the monitor so he must be close. Olivia draws her weapon and begins a search. in another part of the facility, armed Loyalists guard the scientists and Michael at the vivisection room. inside, the medical staff prepares Michael for preservation. a projection of his organs highlights the work to be done)\nOBSERVER SECURITY: There has been a breach in security. Remain here until it is resolved.\nOLIVIA: Don't move. Michael. You okay? Okay, we're gonna get you out of here. Behind you! You okay?\nAGENT LEE: You better get going. I'll be here in case any more come across.\nOLIVIA: Be careful.\nAGENT LEE: You too.\nOLIVIA: Thank you. You have a beautiful family.\nBOLIVIA DUNHAM: Thank you. Go save yours. Get your daughter back.\nOLIVIA: Ready? Okay.\nPETER: Liv.\nOLIVIA: Hey.\nPETER: You okay?\nOLIVIA: I think so.\nASTRID: It's okay, Michael. You're safe now.\nOLIVIA: They know that I crossed over. I don't think that we have much time.\nASTRID: You stay with her. I'll drive.\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: You asked to see me, sir? Is there a problem?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You were one of three officers who knew the high-value detainee's location. If you imparted this information to anyone else, I need to know.\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: He told me that you authorized it, sir.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Who?\nLOYALIST LIEUTENANT: Agent Broyles.\nDECEMBER: I never thought I'd see you again.\nSEPTEMBER: Walter Bishop is back. We have the boy. There's something I need you to do. You owe me."

It's an initiating reactor. It's lost its charge. Without this piece, I cannot reset time.\nDECEMBER: If your plan is successful, we will cease to exist.\nSEPTEMBER: If our plan doesn't succeed, they will cease to exist. After all this time the feelings you had for these people... the feelings we all had, they have not grown in you?\nDECEMBER: When we first came, when we started to experience emotive development by being in this era, we agreed, the 12 of us, to speak nothing of it. You lost control, as did August.\nSEPTEMBER: When we first came here we did not know the true nature of our expedition. We were not told.\nDECEMBER: The people of this era, this is their destiny.\nSEPTEMBER: Destiny can be changed. But you have to have the will to change it... even if it requires sacrifice. I took a risk even coming to see you because I believe that the people of this era are worth saving.\nWALTER: It needs to be at a twenty-two degree angle. 22 degrees. Can you hear me? Blasted thing. What I wouldn't give for a good, old-fashioned tumor-inducing cell phone.\nANIL: I can hear you. Twenty-two degrees. Yeah, copy that.\nWALTER: And make sure it's on an even plane. Absolutely crucial.\nANIL: Okay. Stop. We're there.\nWALTER: What's the energy meter reading? You will see a red light on.\nPETER: Hello?\nBROYLES: It's me. Where are you?\nPETER: We have the boy. We're on our way.\nBROYLES: Once that news starts breaking I want to be out of here. I'm gonna get a few things we'll need and come directly to you.\nPETER: Good enough. We'll speak soon.\nRESIDUE BROYLES: It's me. Where are you at now?\nRESIDUE PETER: We have the boy. We're on our way. We have the boy. We're on our way.\nRESIDUE BROYLES: Once the news starts breaking, I want to be out of here. I'm gonna get a few things we'll need and come directly to you.\nCAROL: Here you are, sir. The checkpoints.\nBROYLES: Thank you, Carol. I, uh, I'll be gone for the rest of the afternoon.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Agent Broyles. I would like a word with you.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: You are aware we had a Level One security breach today, resulting in the abduction of a high-value detainee from our facility.\nBROYLES: No. No, I didn't know that.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: The fugitives knew precisely where we were holding the prisoner.\nBROYLES: You think that information came from someone in my Division?\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: We are exploring all possibilities. I have heard whispers that the Resistance operative known as The Dove' may be among us.\nBROYLES: Well, if that were true, whoever it is should have been read and exposed long ago.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I do not wish to keep you any longer from your duties. Remain vigilant, Phillip.\nSEPTEMBER: Where have you been?\nOLIVIA: Why would he step off the monorail? I mean, why would he do that? He knows too much. He must have known that they wanted to harm him.\nSEPTEMBER: Apparently... there was a reason. There always is.\nWALTER: I\u2019ve spoken to Anil and his men. The magnet has been positioned on the truck as you requested.\nSEPTEMBER: We're missing an important part. The initiating reactor's core decayed substantially over the past twenty years. I enlisted help to secure another one from my time.\nWALTER: An Observer?\nSEPTEMBER: One I trust. But one of you will need to retrieve it.\nPETER: So what is the initiating reactor?\nWALTER: It provides a surge of energy to start up the device. The purpose of this machine is to generate a singularity. Essentially, a small wormhole. And once it's open, then we'll be able to deploy the cylinders.\nSEPTEMBER: They serve to stabilize each end.\nWALTER: And one will remain here in our present as an anchor. The other one will be sent to a specific point in the future - - 2167.\nPETER: How do we get them to 2167?\nSEPTEMBER: That's what the magnet is for.\nWALTER: It's used as a launch platform. It will hold the cylinder at the precise axis it needs to be to enter the wormhole, ensuring that the cylinder reaches its destination. And the scrolls are to help us set those cylinders precisely.\nSEPTEMBER: We'll need two generators to power the magnet.\nWALTER: All ready with Anil.\nPETER: If you're gonna run the magnet off of two generators, they're gonna have to be in perfect phase. We'll need a Synchroscope as well.\nWALTER: I know that and I would have thought of that. It would be one of them, in there, probably near the fish tank.\nOLIVIA: And Michael?\nSEPTEMBER: He will traverse the wormhole to 2167. He'll meet the scientist in Oslo, Norway. And that meeting will change the course of human evolution.\nASTRID: Well how will he know who the scientist is?\nSEPTEMBER: There will be someone there to guide him.\nOLIVIA: It's Broyles. You good?\nBROYLES: I'm leaving for Boston. I\u2019m coming to you.\nPAT WILKINS: This is Agent Pat Wilkins. I have him on the Spring Street, Number 49. Northbound, Lane Two.\nALPHA UNIT: Copy that, traffic control.\nBRAVO UNIT: Bravo Unit is on standby to continue surveillance. Bravo Unit has visual. He's two hundred meters ahead in the right lane.\nALPHA UNIT: Copy that.\nOLIVIA: Call us when you're close. Peter's gonna meet you at the entrance of the steam tunnel. Broyles, are you there? Can you hear me? Hello?\nBROYLES: They're following me. Windmark is letting me lead them to you. I'll lead them around as long as I can. But it's only a matter of time before they realize I'm not leading them to you. If I\u2019m caught, they'll read me. I can protect my thoughts, but there's only so long that'll last.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Windmark is not going to read you because we're going to come and get you.\nBROYLES: The most important thing is the plan.\nOLIVIA: Listen to me, Phillip, you need to tell me where you are.\nBROYLES: Olivia... just get it done.\nOLIVIA: Just tell me wh - -\nWALTER: You heard him. If he's captured, it's only a matter of time before they know we're here. Peter, start excavating that Synchroscope.\nSEPTEMBER: We need to go get the new Initiator.\nWALTER: And we need to gather everything that is required and leave. It's our only chance.\nWALTER: Peter, how are you doing with they Synchroscope?\nPETER: No Synchroscope yet. But I found some sort of syringe. Any idea what that was for or why you had it?\nWALTER: I have no idea.\nPETER: This tape is addressed to me. It's your handwriting.\nRECORDED WALTER: Peter, I sent you a letter. It contains something of mine.\nWALTER: What letter, Walter?\nRECORDED WALTER: I imagine you called me to ask why would you send such a strange letter? And when you tried to call, I didn't answer. So you came to find me at the lab. But I was not to be found. I was here one moment and vanished from the face of the Earth the next. I want you to know I\u2019m fine. And living many, many years from now.\nPETER: What is this, Walter?\nRECORDED WALTER: You will never see me again. You will never see me again because it had to be this way to ensure the future of our humanity. Your future. The future of Olivia. And the future of \u2018Etta. I don't want you to be sad. The time we had together we stole. I cheated fate to be with you. And we shouldn't have had that time together, but we did. And I wouldn't change it for the world. I don't want to say good-bye. But I will say... I love you, Son.\nWALTER: I wasn't truthful with you. I do know what that is. It's an inoculation for time travel. I'm taking the child Observer into the future, Peter. I was already inoculated in 2015. I left this one in case something happened to me and someone else had to bring the boy across to complete the plan.\nPETER: Does it have to be this way?\nWALTER: Yes!\nPETER: Why?\nWALTER: Because, Peter, the boy and I, we will become a paradox. Nature abhors a paradox. It has to heal itself. It does so by deleting me and the boy at the moment of the invasion. The boy and I will disappear after 2015.\nPETER: So in order to maintain a future without the Observers... you and Michael have to live out the rest of your lives in the future.\nWALTER: I know in my soul this is what I am supposed to do. I want you to give Olivia your daughter back. I want to give you your life back. As a father, how could I not do that for you? What I said on the tape about stealing time with you, I meant it. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You are my favorite thing, Peter. My very favorite thing.\nLOYALIST INSPECTOR: Where's the logbook?\nSECOND LOYTALIST: You left it in the car.\nLOYALIST INSPECTOR: No, I didn't. It's in the room.\nSECOND LOYTALIST: Hang on a second.\nOLIVIA: What happened to the part?\nWINDMARK'S COLLEAGUE: This was taken from one of the original twelve scientific expedition team. Your order to monitor the remaining members was wise. When December traveled to the future and procured this unit I was notified.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: What is this?\nWINDMARK'S COLLEAGUE: September is assembling a device with the fugitives. It is a trigger containing an atomic charge that is going to allow them to create a wormhole. They intend to reset time.\nPAT WILKINS: He's in the Number Six stairwell. B-unit, cover the 61st Street exit. Subject is moving on foot. Repeat, he's in the Number Six stairwell.\nWINDMARK'S AIDE: He knows that we know.\nPETER: You're saying we can't complete the plan because we're missing one single piece?\nSEPTEMBER: Without the initiating reactor there's no way we can open the wormhole. There's simply not enough energy.\nOLIVIA: I thought the rocks provided the energy.\nSEPTEMBER: To sustain the reaction, not to trigger it.\nWALTER: Like a car with a full tank and no sparkplug. We're stuck.\nPETER: There must be some place we can find another ignition source. Or maybe we can make one of our own.\nSEPTEMBER: It's impossible. Nothing strong enough is available in this time period.\nOLIVIA: Michael, I need your help. When I crossed over to rescue you, you looked at me like you expected me. You smiled... like you knew I'd come for you. Can you tell me what I should do next?\nASTRID: What about a Shipping Lane?\nWALTER: Of course. If we could gain control of the Shipping Lane, we can use that as our wormhole and everything else would work as planned. You are a genius!\nASTRID: This is the shipping manifest I decoded. It's his schedule. It'll give us the location and the time of the next shipment.\nOLIVIA: So when is it opening?\nSEPTEMBER: Tomorrow morning at 6:08 A.M. 40.7787 North. 73.9776 West.\nPETER: It's New York.\nOLIVIA: Okay, Astrid, see what you can find out about the checkpoints.\nSEPTEMBER: First we need an End Dock Stabilizer.\nWALTER: What is an End Dock Stabilizer?\nSEPTEMBER: It looks like a cube. And you activate it at the location where the wormhole opens.\nPETER: I know exactly what you mean.\nSEPTEMBER: If we recalibrate it, we can reverse the polarity and change the directional flow of the Shipping Lane so that it will send rather than receive.\nOLIVIA: Anil?\nANIL: Broyles. He's been captured. I put out feelers. I'll keep you informed. What does this mean for the plan?\nOLIVIA: It's happening tomorrow morning. There's one other thing we need first.\nWALTER: Peter. Hold on to these tight. Anti-gravity Osmium bullets. Shoot Observers with these and watch them float away like balloons.\nPETER: If we shoot 'em, they're dead. Why do we want 'em to float away?\nWALTER: Because it's cool.\nPETER: That makes sense, Walter.\nOLIVIA: Okay. I'll start loading the car.\nPETER: You gonna be okay?\nASTRID: Walter? There's something I wanna show you.\nSEPTEMBER: Peter... I want to talk to you.\nWALTER: Gene.\nASTRID: I was gonna let her out. But I was afraid that they would hear her moo.\nWALTER: Yes. She does moo quite loudly. Especially after a meal.\nASTRID: I at least wanted you to see her.\nWALTER: You always know how to soothe me. You always have.\nASTRID: Walter, this is not the end. We're gonna win this. And when we do, we'll be... drinking strawberry milkshakes in the lab and not even gonna remember that this happened.\nWALTER: That sounds lovely. It's a beautiful name.\nASTRID: What is?\nWALTER: Astrid.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Before we arrived here we sent a team of twelve. Their mission was to observe and report. However, a strange phenomenon occurred. To some degree or other, they succumbed to irrational emotions. Your kind infected them.\nBROYLES: But not you. You seem to be impervious to everything.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: I will never speak of it again. But I will admit this to you, Phillip. I, too, feel something. I believe you call it... hate.\nBROYLES: The feeling is mutual.\nOLIVIA: What?\nPETER: Remember when I told you that we had a long way to go before seeing her again? It's not that long anymore. We're gonna see her. We're gonna have her back. Nothing else matters.\nOLIVIA: He's here.\nBUILDING ENGINEEER: Hey.\nPETER: Hi.\nBUILDING ENGINEEER: This is an air intake supply line. It leads to half the building.\nPETER: That's enough, believe me.\nBUILDING ENGINEEER: Good luck.\nWALTER: We need to get going. We have to meet them.\nSEPTEMBER: I gave myself the last inoculation. I'm going with him, Walter. I'm taking him into the future. I've already told Peter about my decision. I know you once believed that this was your destiny, a price you had to pay.\nWALTER: I need this. I have prepared myself for this.\nSEPTEMBER: I've been thinking about this since I first saw the boy again. Walter, twenty years ago when I agreed to let you be the one to take him, I didn't have the feelings I have now. Later, when I began to realize the height of his intellect and what you call the depths of his emotion, still, I couldn't understand what it was that I meant to him. And I was unable to reciprocate. When I saw you. When I saw Peter, and saw what he meant to you... then I understood what my feelings were. And why they were important. I can't communicate with him in the traditional ways. When I take his hand and I lead him... he'll know that I love him.\nWALTER: That's being a father.\nSEPTEMBER: It's not about fate, Walter. Yours or mine. It's about changing fate. It's about hope. And protecting our children.\nCAPTAIN WINDMARK: Think about them, Phillip. Think about where they are. They will understand you had no choice. It is acceptable. I am your ally.\nBRAINWAVE BROYLES: At the old Harvard University. Harvard University. They're in the lab. They're in the lab.\nCOMMAND POST: Evacuate! Clear the building!\nFIRST RESPONDER: This room is clear. Nothing.\nSECOND RESPONDER: Keep moving down the hall.\nFIRST RESPONDER: All clear on this end. Go down to the left!\nCOMMAND POST: Evacuate the building!\nFIRST RESPONDER: Let's go, let's go!\nSECOND RESPONDER: Keep going!\nWINDMARK'S LIEUTENANT: It is entering this wing. Evacuate.\nINJURED VICTIM: It just came after us!\nFIRST RESPONDER: Just keep moving! Go!\nPETER: I found one.\nOLIVIA: Good. Because I found something too. We're gonna get you out of here.\nPETER: You don't know how lucky you are this room has no ventilation. Trust me.\nSEPTEMBER: They'll be setting up the corridor soon. We don't have much time. Where are Peter and Olivia?\nASTRID: Olivia, where are you? They've got the cube... and Agent Broyles.\nOLIVIA: Anil, we're in position.\nWALTER: We have to hurry!\nANIL: Team Two, engage.\nLOYALIST DEFENDERS: Stand by. We got a vehicle on approach! Incoming! Coming through! That's an unauthorized vehicle! Take it out! Open fire! We got a breach! Negative, negative! Suppressive fire! All teams converge on main platform. Move, move, move! Regroup, Regroup! Tighten your lines! We got a man down. Stay with them!\nOLIVIA: Michael, stay down.\nLOYALIST DEFENDERS: Two down, and pull 'em in! Return fire! Flank 'em on the left. Let's go! Come on, move, move!\nWALTER: Peter! Peter, look! What did I say? That is cool.\nLOYALIST DEFENDERS: Hold your fire. Regroup, regroup! Two o'clock, Two o'clock! Take 'em out!\nSEPTEMBER: Now, Walter!\nWALTER: Get the boy.\nSEPTEMBER: Let's go.\nPETER: I love you, Dad.\nPETER: I think that I would be happy to stay here for the rest of my life.\nOLIVIA: We should probably get her home soon. Get her into a bath, which is never easy.\nPETER: I nominate you for that one. Etta! It's time to go. Come on, kiddo. It's time to go home.\nOLIVIA: You're being silly."
